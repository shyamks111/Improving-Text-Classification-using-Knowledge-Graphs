Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Incredible.  I was on Adderall for over a year.  My doctor switched me to Vyvanse four days ago.  Since day one, I have felt better than ever.  That &quot;nervous-jittery feeling&quot; (perfect description) as well as anxiety and teeth-grinding that I had while on Adderall is totally gone.  I feel &quot;normal&quot;. I am able to concentrate and focus calmly, and am no longer plagued by excessive energy.  I feel healthy, and everyone around me has noticed the positive difference in such a short amount of time.""",1
Differin,Acne,"""Differin XP has been a miracle product for me. As a girl who&#039;s had moderate breakouts since the age of 13, (am now 23!) I have to say sticking to this product has been very well-worth it! For the first 2 months, yes, my skin was very dry and even flaky, and yes it did turn me off a bit - but I was warned of this side-effect and decided to just keep going with it. I was able to battle the flakiness with use of exfoliants, and even in the first few months, I felt my breakouts were happening less often and were less severe. Now, 8 months later, the flakiness is no longer an issue and find using this product has boosted my quality of life, although I still do get the occasional few tiny pimples - it does its job.""",4
Tramadol,Pain,"""I was prescribed tramadol for pain relief after having all four of my wisdom teeth removed. After reading some of the reviews I felt like I had to post my experience, because everybody is different when it comes to pain tolerance and medication. I&#039;m taking 2, 50mg, roughly every 8 hours (or whenever I&#039;m noticeably uncomfortable) it worked, and still is, working wonders for me. Quick acting, no pain, and a euphoric feeling for many hours, but not debilitating - I still function fine, if not better. Sucks that it doesn&#039;t work for some people which in turn might turn others off from giving it a shot when it may work wonderfully for them! I can see how it could become addictive for people with addictive personalities, so be careful.""",9
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""Hands down the worst medication I&#039;ve ever tried. My Psychiatrist suggested trying a newer ADHD drug but I was enamored by some of the reviews I read on here so I persuaded him to prescribe me Dexedrine. Well what a big mistake. I was given 10mg of Dexedrine and after two weeks of it working it completely backfired. It completely ruined my cognitive abilities. I couldn&#039;t do simple math, my depth perception was off, and my time perception was off as well. I was constantly late to appointments, I had to write down everything on the calendar on my phone otherwise I will forget or think I have more time than I actually had. I would be careful with this medication. It might work for you though.""",1
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""I was taking Norco 10mg 4x a day but it wore off so fast, I asked the doctor for an increase of 20mg. He suggested 20mg Zohydro twice a day and 20 mg norco for breakthrough pain. The medicine is pricey and I had to give it up this month. I am shopping for price comparisons and I have the company coupon that will get 250 off. I didn&#039;t realize how effective it was until I gave it up. How stupid I was! This stuff covers me from getting out of the bed until it runs out, which is about 8 hours later, so I probably need to move up to the 30s. I have an appointment in a few days and I am going to tell my doc to keep the norco&#039;s and just adjust my zohydro and I will rob banks to pay for it.! I had my life back for awhile. I miss it.""",9
Levomilnacipran,Depression,"""Ignore all the negative reviews because this drug might work for you. I&#039;ve had depression for decades and have tried 18 different drugs over the years.  Only 3 meds have worked for me, and Fetzima is one of them. This drug saved my life.  The side effects slowly went away over a 6 week time period.  Yes, it is energizing at first and you may need to take an extra amount of benzo to calm you down, but the side effects eventually go away for some of us, although it seems like they never will for weeks.  Give it time to work!""",5
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I have been on lexapro for about 6 months. I started on 5mg then 10mg then 15mg which is what I am on now.  For the first few weeks it lowered my mood but now I am a whole new person and it was completely worth it.  I am so focused on work, enjoy socializing so much more now, appreciate music, it has really lifted my mood from a 4/10 to a 10/10. I still have bad days every now and then but nothing compared to before.  My social anxiety has also almost completely gone and people at work comment on how confident I am. I started my job after about 6 weeks of taking it so they never knew me before.  I think its really good how it has made me so focused and goal motivated too at work and in life, I am really happy I started this medication.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""
A previous poster Ryan Smith said &quot;I&#039;ve seen some of the reviews and I have a question for yall how did yall get your doctor to give phentermine to you for 6 months to a year my doctor will only give it to me 1 out of every 3 months&quot;
Just to let you know how I get it ...

I am attending a weight loss clinic, look for one in your area, they do weekly weigh ins and check your blood pressure weekly, and at the start they did a complete blood workup. I don&#039;t have a lot to lose, 5&#039;9&quot; and weighed 171lbs. My goal is 150lbs. Today is day 30, I have lost 18lbs. I started out with 1/2 a pill then after 1 week moved up to 1 a day, it really controls my appetite. I am doing this with a Ketogenic diet.It truly works, I&#039;m not hungry.""",3
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I have had GAD ever since I can remember and I am 31 now. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING helped. My anxiety was so extreme, every minute of every day I was consumed with it. I had severe panic attacks and would sometimes faint. Gabapentin has been life changing for me. I have been on it for 3 months and my GAD is almost gone. I still have panic attacks at night, but this medication has been a miracle for me and I am and would definitely recommend trying it, specially if you are not responsive to &#039;normal&#039; anxiety medications.""",7
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Post concussion, leading to: explosive outbursts, withdrawal from activities I used to enjoy, addictive behaviors.  I wasn&#039;t worried about the skin rash; the evidence is clear when slowly titrated up, the risk is  low.  I have experienced some cognitive sluggishness and muscle cramping at 150mg, but they are only annoyances.   Drug saved my marriage and job, allowed me to become self-reflective (rather than self-hating) again.  Also, I have experienced another (very welcome!) side effect: um, er, astonishing sexual pleasure.  When I told my doc about this, he smiled, said a small percentage of patients will have this &quot;side effect&quot;.  I&#039;m glad I have!  So, the drug has worked well for me in many regards.""",6
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""Day 9 of Trintallex. Have seen glimpses of normality but have still been highly unstable and dysfunctional. Side effects include: little bit itchy skin, headache, ringing in the ears, agitation/hyperactive at times. I know I&#039;m early in the process.... This is extremely difficult. I&#039;m considering getting the DNA testing to find a more suitable med if I don&#039;t see harsh improvements in the next couple of weeks.""",5
Tapentadol,Pain,"""250mg once every 12hrs didn&#039;t do much for pain in ER formulation for me but the 50mg worked quite well as a breakthrough pain medication when combined with 2/3 my typical dosage of Oxycontin.  I found that pain relief duration at 50mg was about 4hrs.  I believe that the ER formulation starts at 100mg and higher.  I am lethargic on Nucynta ER at the 250mg 2x a day dose compared to Oxycontin 30mg 3x daily.""",9
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""It worked well for my depression. I noticed an improvement in mood after a week. It gave me energy. I took 150 mg of the sustained release formula every morning for about one month. I stopped just after I picked up my next month&#039;s prescription which I still have. I stopped because I thought it was inducing mania in me and causing anxiety. I&#039;m now not so sure this was the cause. I also quit smoking about two days after I started on this medication and had absolutely no side effects from nicotine withdrawal.

This medication gave me some side effects for the first two weeks. Lack of appetite, bloating, dizziness (especially when smoking cigarettes, this is what prompted me to quit). I also experienced tingling in my hands.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This is my 2nd post to this site.  I have taken the pill for 4 weeks now and I am down 13 pounds.  I am very happy with my results.  It has cut my eating in half.  The weight loss is slowing down but I don&#039;t want quick results.  I just want to lose the weight.  I have 47 pounds to go.  It has cut my cravings for sweets.  I have a dry mouth but don&#039;t mind drinking more water.  I still give it a 10.""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""After a Med cocktail of Xanax (for sudden anxiety attacks), Zoloft, Lithium, Klonopin (for everyday anxiety) &amp; Wellbutrin, I still felt severely depressed &amp; eventually suicidal. I went to my psychiatrist in extreme distress with a constant stream of tears. She sent me to an inpatient facility where they put me on Lamictal. Within 7 days, I felt a drastic difference; stable, focused, even bubbly (but not manic). I take 50 mg (25 in the AM; 25 in the PM). I am so thankful for this medicine!""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve taken Contrave and 0.25mg of Topamax for 7 days. I&#039;ve lost 6 lbs. Very happy. Side effect symptoms include: Mental Fog, Short Term Memory Loss, Anxiety, Depression. The Brain fog and Anxiety/Depression are awful. I&#039;m hoping the symptoms go away soon. Haven&#039;t experienced the headaches (maybe b/c of the Toprimate) &amp; no night sweats! Meds have eliminated cravings &amp; emotional eating. Thought Wellbuterin was an anti-depressant but I&#039;m uncharacteristically depressed &amp; anxious. So Weird! Is this how everyone else is feeling? I plan to lose 30 lbs by February. I&#039;ll update.""",2
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am a 23 year old female. My entire life I have tested highly, been in advanced classes, had a full scholarship through college, but my grades were always a struggle. I felt like I had to work so much harder than everyone else just to keep my B grades. I was disorganized, forgetful, irritable, and pretty desolate. I felt like I was drowning.
I have taken medication for depression and anxiety since I was in high school - everything from Wellbutrin, to Xanax, to Prozac. I graduated from college in four years with a mediocre GPA, but with many awards. Finally my new doctor actually listened when I spoke, and she agreed that we try a course of medication for ADHD. I am on my second week of Vyvanse and am a new, happy, functioning person.""",1
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I have had Mirena in for 1 year and 9 months. I have a positive experience so far. I got it put in place 2 months after having my son. When I first got it in, it did not really hurt. I kind of feel that I have had weight gain from it (after having my son, I lost 20-25 lbs right off the bat). I gained all the weight back, I had lost and plus 10 lbs more, despite exercising a lot and eating right. I&#039;ve also had a little discomfort with sex (only recently) I have also notice that when I should be bleeding, I only get cramping.  I only had about 2 months of regular periods. I really find this method of birth control great, except for the few side effects. I plan on getting the Mirena out in October, to see if the side effects go away.""",8
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I love Skyla. Since I got Skyla 10 months ago I have never had to worry about being pregnant. My boyfriend and I have unprotected sex and he doesnt pull out or anything 4-5x a week and I NEVER have to worry about the effectiveness. Getting Skyla inserted was nothing... I took a few advils and a painkilller before insertion because I was so scared it was going to hurt, but it felt like mild discomfort and pressure for a few seconds. The worst part is the spotting. I spotted for about 2 months straight after I got it and still spot sometimes but my periods are short and few and far between. im occasionally very emotional (once a month). I get random cramps sometimes but its not bad given how effective this is with hardly any side effects""",8
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My 7 and 11 yr old children take 18mg and 36mg respectively. The 7 yr old also takes a 5mg Methalin tab at about 3PM because she melts into a screaming pile of shattered emotions otherwise.  Actually, that&#039;s how she was ALL THE TIME before she started taking Concerta. The 11 yr old recently increased his dose because he&#039;s getting older and bigger.  He was singing/humming/noise making in class again (which is what clued me in to a higher dose. He started taking Concerta because he couldn&#039;t access information when doing homework. The information was there, he just couldn&#039;t concentrate long enough to access what he needed. VERY frustrating for him. He isn&#039;t hyperactive like the other child, so he was diagnosed at a later age. Side effects: sleepless until 12AM.""",1
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""So, Saxenda was effective for me for weight loss but the side effects I cannot tolerate. 

 I was SO tired I could not stay awake when I get home from work.  I actually started to think something serious might be wrong with me to be this fatigued. So I stopped Saxenda and then I felt normal again --so realized that Saxenda was making me so that fatigued, I realized I don&#039;t want to feel this way to lose weight.

My insurance did not cover either.  $$$$$$""",2
Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed in 1989. I was an 18 year boy at the time. After several years of miss diagnosis I was diagnosed in the mid 90&#039;s with bipolar disorder. I&#039;ve been on a lot of different medications, most I don&#039;t remember very well but in 2003 I was hospitalized for one month and put on Zyprexa. I got my life back I am now married, own my own home and have my own business. I am now were I want to be. The down side is I went from 180lbs to 240 lbs in 5 years. I am now border line diabetic, and my cholesterol level very high. I am now not on Zyprexa. The medicine did the job it is supposed to but my doctor and I are looking for a medication similar to Zyprexa with out the weight gain.""",6
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Well had many changes or should I say increases in medication as I seem to only get 12 months benefit then medication becomes less and less effective. Regarding  quetiapine I was on 60mg a day. 9 months ago I started to become ill again. I became suicidal. so saw my psychiatrist. He  said the current thinking was 600 to 800 mg of quetiapine.  was the effective dose to take for bipolar. So now I am on 600mg every evening. I am back to being well and have been for many months  The only side is effect is relaxing of muscles, talking like a drunk.So to take it early evening,and go to bed  once I start feeling drowsy,""",6
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I have been on kolonopin for almost a year now &amp; it has been an absolute life saver! I had horrible panic attacks, scared to drive, couldn&#039;t even go shopping without getting dizzy and anxious.  Anxiety has taken over my life, the panic attacks are so scary I thought I was going to die. I&#039;m very greatful to have this medicine.  I&#039;ve heard of problems with dependency but I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do without it, I&#039;m also on zoloft &amp; I feel like I have my life back!""",7
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My son was diagnosed with ADHD when he was in the first grade.  At the advice of his then doctor we did not treat him with any medications.  My son is the sweetest, kindest kid and wanted to please everyone (teachers, parents, etc).  However, he struggled so much with academics and general life organization.  Homework time was a nightmare. By the time he was in 4th grade I broke down and took him to a doctor to try medications because something HAD to change. Vyvance has changed his life for the better. All of his grades went up in a matter of weeks, his homework is completed correctly and neatly before I even get home, and he will even tell you he feels better in general.  He also tried Adderrall but that just made him very hostile.""",1
Qsymia,Obesity,"""To make a long story short. I was exalted with this weight loss journey on my own. After being fed up and knowing that I was in the season of Fall with Thanksgiving 3 weeks away, I needed a solution. Therefore, I took it upon myself on 11/04/14 at my appointment with my Endocrinologist to request a pharmaceutical pill that would aide my weight loss and BMI of 40. He gave me two options and I went with Qsymia. Thank God it was a free two week trial! Four days later, I can say I am 10 lbs lighter. Ladies and gentlemen, please do understand results may vary.""",2
Wellbutrin SR,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking Wellbutrin SR 4 days ago. I took it in addition to Seroquel XR. It helped for a couple of days. During those days I only experienced some dizziness, and decreased appetite and sex drive. Although yesterday evening I was hospitalized with a 5 minute long grand-mal seizure. I don&#039;t have a history of seizure disorders, and the Doctors believe that this seizure was caused by Wellbutrin SR. If you take Wellbutrin SR and antipsychotics together, I suggest that you speak with your pharmacist or health provider.""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have severe insomnia. My therapist prescribed me 10 mg Ambien as a short term solution. I was so amazed and excited to SLEEP! Within 20 minutes, I just fell asleep and it was so wonderful. She had warned me of sleepwalking. But I told her &quot;that was impossible because I had never done that in my 65 years of live&quot;!

In my 5th week of taking Ambient, I woke up with the taste of blood in my mouth, a loose tooth, a skinned knee, and bruised shoulder. Yes, I had walked in my sleep, sat in a chair and fell out of it face first. Luckily, one of my granddaughter&#039;s was spending the night and witnessed the incident. So, if you are naive like me and think it cannot happen to you, please think about it. Good luck """,0
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I have been taking 30 mg once daily for the last month. It&#039;s definitely doing something. I&#039;ve broken out everywhere and I mean everywhere. Huge, gross, cystic and nodular pimple. BUT my dermatologist said that it has to get better before it gets worse. Where my skin isn&#039;t being overran by grossness you can tell that it is clearing up and looking healthier. Tomorrow I will start my new dosage of 40 mg twice daily(the first month you start with 30 a day and then after that my dermo said they figure it out with your body weight) Side effects: pretty bad chapped lips, dry wrists and arms, also always in the bathroom cause I&#039;ve been drink between a gallon and half to two gallons of water a day.""",4
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I went to the doctor on early February 2017.  My blood pressure was through the roof and I was pre-diabetic. After bloodwork he prescribed Lisinopril and Belviq. I started taking Belviq on 2/10/2017 and my starting weight was 194 at 5&#039;2&quot;.  It is 3/2 and now I am 188.  I know it shows it to be slow, however, the slowest part was in the beginning when I guess my body was getting used to the medication.  The first week I did not lose any weight.  As the day passed I was seeing my weight loss started to forward.  Now I am losing 1 lb a day.  I am eating sensibly and replacing one or two meals with a Raw Juice full of vegetables like Kale, ginger, green apple, etc.  I am also very tired at night which is helping me get a nice restful sleep.""",3
Contrave,Obesity,"""I began taking Contrave almost 9 months ago.  I am 5&#039; 4&quot; and started at 175 lbs.  I got on the scale this morning (I rarely do now to avoid obsessing) and now weigh 144 lbs.  This is a big deal for me, I have tried EVERYTHING and nothing worked.  The first month was absolute hell but if you push through it will work.  My appetite is less and I feel full much faster.  The Contrave controls my eating as I clearly cannot.  I go from hungry to beyond full very quickly and it lasts!  Crucial.  Good luck all.""",2
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am a 33 yr old male, I started taking Vyvanse yesterday and it is the first medication that I have ever taken for anything really. I was B student in school because I refused to do homework, I couldn&#039;t concentrate enough to motivate myself to do it and I suffered in college for it. Now I manage restaurants. I am happy with that choice but lately as pressures from work seemed to increase, I chose to see a psychiatrist to help me complete tasks. I am taking 50mg a day, I usually wait until noon to dose since I work until 1 am most nights. So far, so good, a little jittery but it is new to my system. Slight loss of appetite but nothing that concerns me. I am happy with my choice so far.""",1
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Paxil now for 3 months. Within 2 weeks ALL of my random panic attacks stopped. No more frustration or trying to understand why I have crushing panic attacks... they are gone and I sleep like a baby. It is God sent I lived in turmoil for years. I&#039;m taking 20mg every morning. Only bad part is.... I have almost no appetite and my sex drive is slightly lower than normal. Small price to pay to have peace of mind. Hope this helps.""",7
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""Panic attacks and anxiety were completely gone, but with that came tons of side effects. I gained over 40 pounds and it was IMPOSSIBLE lose until getting off of Paxil. No sex drive and couldn&#039;t orgasm at all while on it. It made me a little zombie-like, I didn&#039;t have any low emotions but not any high ones either. Coming off of it gave me extreme symptoms like headaches, loss of appetite, sore muscles, insomnia, mood swings, and weird violent thoughts. Will all be worth it though once I&#039;m over the withdrawal period. Positive withdrawal symptom: Weight loss!!""",7
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""The only times I have had the medicine is when I have had arterial surgeries and Dilaudid was administered by IV. As previous posts have stated, it goes into effect 30 - 60 seconds after administration, but with a slight heating effect in the injected vein. Soon after the blissful pain relief has occurred. I was able to intently listen to a book or watch TV: sleep was also easy if I wanted. This was only a 1mg dose, but surprisingly effective. It killed the pain while allowing one to be mentally alert (if desired), unlike morphine. I highly recommend this medicine for hospital pain relief, but for longer term pain relief, up to 6 hours, it was supplemented with 5 mg of Vicodin.""",9
Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorde,"""As someone else pointed out that they have like 0.02% of side effects. That&#039;s me... my psychiatrist has to look up my side effects because they are so random and uncommon. I tell everyone Cymbalta saved my life. I have battled blood pressure for 10 years and have been on 27 different medicines for it. Although, I luckily do not have a severe case of blood pressure, I do need to learn how to handle stress better and went on Cymbalta after a nervous breakdown that put me in the hospital. Was put on Cymbalta and Depakote, the best medicines ever. 16 months later and 70 pounds heavier, I am doing great. Weight gain was from Depakote, and so I got off of that 3 months ago, but Cymbalta is still keeping me afloat.""",6
Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,"""Seroquel XR has changed my life! I tried regular Seroquel and it&#039;s like having your head in a bucket. The XL version feels like a completely different medicine. I take 100 mg at night. I wake up refreshed, happy, eager to start my day, I also take Lamictal 300 mg in the morning. No side effects from either medicine. I have been on both for about 7 years. I have been depressed once in that time and it was situational.""",6
Adderall,ADHD,"""Started taking Adderall about 3.5 years ago while in my early twenties for ADD. After already been diagnosed at around 7 my parents refused to put me on medicines. I was never able to sit still, go a day without being extremely restless in class, and many times was sent to the office for being loud. After extreme fatigue and no motivation to finish anything including zero motivation to work, depression, etc. I started Adderall. Has helped so much (at first) things got done, class/work was way smoother. And had interest in things I always struggled to absorb. Cons... tolerance builds fast. Sleep is a must or you feel like a corpse. (After the first few weeks sleep comes easier though.) Nervous.  Jittery. """,1
Minocycline,Acne,"""16 years old on solodyn  and ziana for 3wks. My face has cleared up significantly. I have cystic acne, I started breaking out badly in sept of this year. I tried basically everything over the counter. My mom took me to a dermatologist and this is what he prescribed , so far it works. However , still wash with panoxyl  am and pm and benzac for spot treatment. When my skin is vey dry I use yes to tomatoes moisturizer and daily repair treatment .""",4
Pregabalin,Pain,"""This medication is first line treatment in chronic pain. Its pharmacological side effects are quite similar to benzodiazepenes. Side effects include acute cognitive impairment, significant motor control reduction, loss of swift reflex&#039;s, inability to concentrate etc etc.
Anyone who studied pharmacology knows that benzodiazepene&#039;s are far more addictive physically and mentally and the withdrawal can be LETHAL, via seizure and death, as compared to opiods/iates, where it will not kill but the withdrawal will be highly uncomfortable.

So lyrica, gabapentin and the other drugs that fall into the category, at least of the way I lay them out as &#039;gaba-nergic&#039; like, side effect, drugs.

These drugs are MORE DANGEROUS THEN OPIODS. This is objective.""",9
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I have been treated with Lexapro, Zoloft, Pristiq, Klonopin and lamictal and none were effective. I have been taking Cymbalta for about one week now, and still don&#039;t feel any different. I wake up every day feeling 100% anxious and find it extremely hard to get out of bed. It has been this severe for about two months now where I feel totally incapable of living. Doctor said to stay on Cymbalta and see if it changes anything. Feeling hopeful!""",7
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""We couldn&#039;t be more pleased with this medication.  My 9 year old son was previously on Concerta and Metadate CD.  Although those medications were effective, Vyvanse has greatly out performed both.  The most significant side effect has been lack of appetite.  We encourage a late meal so that he can make up for what he has missed throughout the day.  His weight seems to be holding steady following an initial weight loss of 6 pounds.  This is a medication worth trying!""",1
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Lexpro is the best medication. I had no life befor Lexpro. I used to suffer for 8 years from anxiety and panick attacks. I was always scared from anything. The doctor asked me to try Lexpro I was so afriad of medications, I thought medications would never help me. I used think that I will help my self to stop thinking about it. I thought they were all thoughts in my mind and I have to change them I used to get panick attacks everday when I&#039;m sleeping. I would recommend anyone to try this medication because this medication will safe your life if you have anxity I have been 10 mg for months then 15 for 2 months and 4 months for 20 Mg and am still taking it. And I will never stop taking it""",7
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking Cipralex 20mg in the morning and 15mg Remeron at night and would take from 0.5mg to 1mg of lorazapam in the morning as this is when my anxiety is worst. Since my anxiety was not improving, I decided to get off the Remeron to reduce the Seratonin. Remeron was great for helping me sleep but the withdrawal was awful. I decided to use lorazapam to help me sleep which worked well for a while. Without the Remeron my morning anxiety became better and I started to have better days. This only lasted about a week. Pretty soon I was having sleeping problems and the lorazapam didn&#039;t help my daily anxiety either and in fact at times I felt worse. This is the downfall of lorazapam. You build up a tolerance and have to increase the dose.""",7
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""Hello all, just back from the doctor...lost another 3.2 lbs...started at 266.7 lbs on June 19 and now at 229.0lb. on Nov 17. Lost total of 37.7 lbs. in 5 months. As you approach your ideal weight you start to lose less and less. When I started, I was barely eating but now back to 3 meals a day but the nice thing about this medicine is that it also teaches you how to eat. I could probably lose more but my goal is 225 lbs ( 4 more pounds ) and then I will stop. Also, I followed the dose schedule. Made it to 3.0 then went backwards and now at 0.6 again. Once I reach my goal, I am stopping as the meds are costing me $450 a month with needles. Don&#039;t be discouraged. This stuff works. Try and exercise as well and the pounds will melt off.  Cheers.""",3
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I had been on Ritilan for 10 years and found I kept increasingly the dose every year or so. I went on this medication and got so sick. I was very angry and had urges to hurt people I cared about. It felt so weird my hair felt like it was growing tingly feeling. Vision impairment etc, I stopped taking this when I had such strong urges to strangle someone. Very scary. This medication is not for me.""",1
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been using the immediate release form of Oxycodone for many years frequently in combination with codeine for chronic back pain.  For me the combination is more effective than either alone.  I try to take the minimum dose necessary to control my pain, which for me is about 5 to 10 mg Oxy plus 60 mg codeine 3 or 4 times a day, depending on my level of physical activity.   As mentioned by others, tolerance and dependence or addiction (btw, not the same thing) are the main problems.""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""My 16 year old son has had acne- not to the point of scaring but enough to really affect his self esteem.
He is now under a specialist and has been taking Accutane for about 3-4 months.40mg per day.
After a month or so his skin was even worse and it was quite horrific but now he is nearly clear !
He has always been very moody and I have constantly been worried that he may have depression.
He has shown NO signs of being any worse on this medication !
Dry, dry, dry lips is the worst side effect and his self esteem is better.""",4
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been using 10mg Ambien for about 10 years now. I sleep very soundly and awake 6-8 hours later refreshed and loads of energy. Not every night, maybe 2 or 3 times a week. It is my miracle drug, but ONLY if I take it on an empty stomach! I too have had some &quot;amnesia&quot; like times. When I first began taking it, I called an ex boyfriend while my husband was asleep next to me. Thank God the side effects have gone away!""",0
Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""I was on the Ortho Evra patch for a couple years and after the first 3 months of your body adjusting to it, (which you are forewarned about) just regular side effects, mood swings, regular cramps (when your time is almost near) and I believe it gave me a high sex drive. I&#039;ve been off of it for about 5 months and my sex drive plummeted dramatically. It&#039;s extremely convenient due to my forgetting to take the pill everyday. I usually put it on my pelvis and rotate sides each week.""",8
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started taking this medication on Feb 10, 2010.  From the first day I took it I have had the same overall feelings, cotton mouth-which is overcome by drinking a lot of water, an energy boost, and no appetite.  I have to &#039;remind&#039; myself to eat.  I try to keep a log of everything I eat, so that way I can see if I am eating enough or not.  So far, I have lost about 5-7lbs.  I have not went to the gym yet, but am getting a membership this Saturday.  This medication was just the boost I needed to get started losing weight.  I would recommend this diet pill to anyone who needs to lose a significant amount of weight.  I cannot wait to see how much additional weight I will lose by adding exercise to my diet routine.""",3
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""Ativan 0.5mg calms me down considerably within 30 minutes, but the side effects are so bad that I can&#039;t continue to take it. I experienced EXTREME, loss of energy, tiredness, laziness, apathy, and increase in appetite.  This might be okay for someone who&#039;s at home trying to recover from panic attacks, but not for me. I work 5 days a week and this past week that I was only taking 1 x 0.5mg pill a day was the absolute worst week I&#039;ve ever had at work, living in a fog and totally wiped out of energy. I hardly got ANYTHING done which is totally out of character for me.  Also when this medicine wears off in a few hours it makes me very irritable and nervous. """,7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have taken adipex before and lost 70 lbs in 3 months. I ran two miles everyday and ate lean cuisines. I was on a 1200 calorie diet. It took me two years to gain the weight back, being in college life gets busy and it just happened. Now I&#039;m back on it and have lost 20 lbs in 3 weeks. I recommend it to anyone who is serious about losing weight. You have to work hard to see amazing results, but it&#039;s completely worth it. From the comments I&#039;ve seen some people were only prescribed it for 2 or 3 months, it may be a location issue but my doctor in MS will prescribe adipex for a patient for 6 months out of the year.""",3
Effexor XR,Depression,"""I&#039;m a middle aged professional that&#039;s dealt with depression and anxiety since my teen years.  I&#039;ve tried many different types of medications that target anxiety and depression, albeit with mixed results.  

My depression, stress, and anxiety levels had gotten worse within the last year (haven&#039;t been on any medications for over 10 years), so I went to see my doctor. I&#039;ve been taking Effexor for about a month now and it&#039;s, by far, given me the most relief over any previous med.

Stress levels have gone way down as I no longer tend to ruminate on things out of my control. It&#039;s much easier to drop the negative thinking and move on to something else.  Anxiety and depression have also been greatly reduced.  
No major side effects for me (at 37.5)""",5
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on Belviq for 7 weeks and have lost 17 lbs already! I have hypothyroidism so I have been unable to lose weight despite trying (and sticking with) pretty much every weight loss diet or supplement available. Belviq was a last resort and I am so glad I tried it. I did have some mild headaches the first few days and my brain seemed to be on overdrive. I actually had trouble sleeping initially although most reviewers say they slept better after trying Belviq.

I am also doing the Fast Diet (5:2 diet) 2 non-consecutive days of the week so I do think that helps. I had been doing the Fast Diet 4 months prior to starting Belviq, but only was losing about a 1/2 lb a week.. so the Fast Diet is not very impressive on it&#039;s own.""",3
Meperidine,Pain,"""My lifelong Dr retired a year ago, he prescribed me Meperidine 100mg tabs QID, and MS Contin 60mg TID. Best relief and combo for pain EVER! No side effects, NO pain! He also gave me IM shots of Meperidine 100ng-150mg, mixed with Valium 10mg in office, as needed for breakthrough Crohns symptoms. My new doctor kept me on the MS Contin, but refuses to provide Meperidine. He switched me to Oxymorphone IR 10mg, 1-2 tabs QID as needed. It doesn&#039;t come close to providing the pain relief the Meperidine did, for my back, shoulder, and Crohns related pain! I don&#039;t know what the big deal is with the Opana, it sure doesn&#039;t help me at all!! Show me all the charts you want to, Opana does not work as good as Demerol!, nor anything else I&#039;ve been put on!""",9
Copper,Birth Control,"""I was so worried about getting it fitted that the first time, when the nurse had only just starting going into my cervix and I could start feeling uncomfortable I chickened out. However I tried again, took a few more pain killers and went to a different place where the doctor was very experienced fitting coils on childless women like me and the nurse was lovely and held my hand and chatted throughout. It wasn&#039;t comfortable but it wasn&#039;t horrible either. I have some period type cramping and spotting for a few days and everything was fine, I even went for a run on day 3 after the fitting. My periods are slightly heavier than when I was on the pill but they are the same as when I wasn&#039;t on any contraceptive. I love it and highly recommend.""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had the implant for 5 months now and have not had any bleeding, acne or weight gain once. It would be an absolute dream if it didn&#039;t give me constant anxiety attacks. I am getting it removed tomorrow. But everyone is different so don&#039;t let the reviews completely put you off, but do bear in mind that any depression/anxiety/crying IS definitely caused by it. its a VERY real side effect

Avoid if you have mental health issues!""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""If I were to just review this drug from an anxiety/fear of social interaction standpoint, I would say that Lexapro is awesome. Lexapro has stopped me from having tremors every time someone talked to me out of the blue, and I do not mind being in the spotlight anymore during classes. For (group) presentations, I still feel physical symptoms and my tremor building up, but not nearly as much as I did without Lexapro. My biggest fear happens to be giving presentations and this is what I am taking it for primarily. I think if I were to do a standalone presentation, I would still have A LOT of difficulty focusing on the topic at hand but not because of anxiety. This drug makes it very hard for me to focus in school. Hope to go down to 5mg from 10""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I have been taking vyvanese for about 21 months. I have been taking 30 mg and will not up it. I am 63 and sought help after reading some blogs about older adults taking this to help focus and have more energy. I have never really taken any medication my whole life. I take it mainly on work days and if off or on vacation I generally don&#039;t take it. On this blog it sounds like a lot users have other issues. Anyways this medication has worked wonders for me, makes me more sociable, happy and able to continue concentrate. I work as an engineer. I follow my doctors recommendation in taking it first thing in the morning with food. It generally wears off about 4-5 pm, no sleep problem. I highly recommend for older adults but keep dose low.""",1
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I received this medication in the ER for kidney stones.  Twice before the ER had given me Demerol for this pain and while it helped it did not completely give me relief.  THIS did! I do not know if it caused nausea or not, because they gave me Zofran along with it.  I know that if I am ever in severe pain again I hope the doctor will give me this medicine.  Also I had no memory loss like I do with morphine, which is a plus.  I only received it through IV.""",9
Topiramate,Bipolar Disorde,"""I can only describe my experience as horrendous. I was given topi max to balance out the severe anxiety and restlessness and insomnia I had on abilify. It had the opposite effect, after about three weeks taking it I developed severe fatigue, inability to swallow properly, paranoia and the anxiety and restlessness went through the roof, I have never been so close to ending it all to get out of the hell that had become my head. I stopped taking both abilify and topomax and resumed on my original aerogel. Within 24 hours all the symptoms of anxiety and suicidality had gone. A trully terrifying experience that nearly saw my children without a mother""",6
Viibryd,Depression,"""I have been on Viibryd for about 8 months now. In the past, I have been on Zoloft, Effexor, and Pristiq. The Pristiq seemed to work okay for a while, then it seemed to slowly stop working, so my psychiatrist recommended trying Viibryd since it has an added built-in benefit similar to Abilify&#039;s low-dose impact when administered with an anti-depressant. I think the worst part about changing medications is coming off of older antidepressants. With Viibryd, the added &quot;spark&quot; appeared during week 2 (20 mg). I have never felt better in my life. Anxiety ran high for the first couple of weeks, but that was the only side-effect and it was short-lived. Additionally, zero sexual side effects.""",5
Topiramate,Bipolar Disorde,"""Topamax helps tremendously with mixed bipolar and rapid cycling. However I was an athlete at the time, rode cycling and a psychiatric nurse, I went from 120 to 105.  This was not a bad experience for me. 

My manager illegally pulled me in her office and told me, granted she is not even an RN and told me I had anorexia and an eating disorder and illegally
discriminated against me to stop me from working with eating disordered patients.

My doctor even told her I was normal and healthy, just solid muscle.

PS. Have you ever seen a serious road cyclist have an ounce of fat on them?

""",6
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I believe this medication saved my life. I did feel extremely sleepy at first while my dosage was being raised but that went away quickly. I have a new feeling of wanting to get up and do things that wasn&#039;t there before. I also feel a sense of calm and peacefulness. The only side effects so far that were troublesome is constipation and sometimes it&#039;s hard to concentrate if someone is speaking.""",7
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve had severe GAD and social phobia with light panic attacks on a daily basis for several years so much so that I could not function at work (I work in the mortgage industry - sales related) and the anxiety would KILL the deal because client&#039;s would interpret the anxiety as not being confident in the product.  

Generally also had trouble looking people in the eye, not being able to think straight, stuttering, difficulty making decisions. 

Psych put me on Xanax, but too sedating and a bit harsh &amp; didn&#039;t last very long, was put on Celexa (but this just made me not care about anything and had no emotions, caused mania etc.  Clonazepam didn&#039;t quite do it.. Started Valium 3 weeks ago a and wow all previous symptoms gone and feel normal!""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""WARNING: Majority of the positive reviews for this drug are from people that are new to Vyvanse and problem is that this drug works wonders at start but benefits quickly starts to diminish and side effects start to get worse.
I took vyvanse for two years and at first it worked great for ADD. However after taking it consistently for few months I started experiencing anxiety, depression, aggressiveness, anti social behavior, insomnia and isolation... things I never experienced before in my life. The drug is also very addictive because if you stop you feel 100x worse then before you started taking it but the longer you take it the higher dosage you need to get same effect. Eventually it stops working and you just need it to get out of bed.""",1
Minocin,Acne,"""I took this medication a couple years ago. Within just a few weeks it was working amazing and my skin was clearing up and looked great!!! I went off the med so that I could go on birth control.  I&#039;ve had trouble with several birth controls and now 2 years later at the age of 22, I&#039;m not currently on any form of birth control so I started this up again about 3 months ago for my acne. I was on it for 2 months, never missed a dose....and there was not one change in my skin.  I&#039;m sure it all depended on my health 2 yrs ago and now, the different meds i&#039;m on now and wasn&#039;t in the past, etc. Several factors could be played as to why it&#039;s no longer working for me at this time. So I&#039;d say at least give it a shot because when it did work, IT WORKED!""",4
Spironolactone,Acne,"""Started taking this drug about 3 months ago. It took about a month to completely clear up my chest and back acne. It had a significant effect on my facial acne. The cysts only last a couple days now and my face is noticeably clearer. Very happy with this result! The only side effect I personally am not super happy about is the weight loss. I am 5&#039;8&quot; and usually 125-130 pounds. Three months into this drug I now weigh 114 pounds and feel very tired all the time. I have tried drinking more water than usual and have increased my sodium intake which is helping with the light headed-ness. Otherwise I have not changed my eating habits and the pounds keep coming off. Not sure how to combat this beside stuffing myself.""",4
Depakote ER,Bipolar Disorde,"""Honestly this medicine has saved my life! I went from having multiple long lasting episodes of mania to none. Ya i still get the thoughts but im relaxed and able to make conscious choices now that im on it. The only negative side affect is the hair loss but its temporary, but so worth it. Nothing is better than feeling like you are in control of yourself,  and this medicine does this for you dont be scared to ask your doctor about it!""",6
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I have had 24/7 severe Headaches for 7 1/2 years due to a condition I have called Occipital Nueralgia.  I have tried every kind of pain medicine and preventative medicine out there, NOTHING WORKED!  I am on 40mg of Opana 3x/day, and it is wonderful, I can function and work and play with my kids and be out in the sun for the first time in 7 yrs, this totally keeps my pain under control.  I love it.  I highly suggest that any one with chronic severe pain try it.  IT WORKS""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on Contrave since 12/2016.  Began three days after Christmas.  I was 250 lbs.  I lost thirty &amp; down to 220 in three months (80 carbs a day) &amp; maintained until (chocolate season of Easter), but now I am up to 230.  I don&#039;t feel the medication is working anymore- at all.  However, the doctor has scared me into believing I will gain back the other 20 if I go off of it.  I&#039;m a sugar addict.   Plain and simple.  It&#039;s like crack cocaine.  Tried telling the doctor this who wanted me to try CBT.  Yeah, no.  I don&#039;t need any armchair psychoanalyst telling me that &quot;Hey, you really crave sugar.&quot;  I get about 15,000 steps in a day, but it doesn&#039;t help.  I want to lose another 50 pounds, but it&#039;s clear that this medication won&#039;t be part of it.""",2
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I can&#039;t rate it yet but I gave it a 5 because it&#039;s been about 5 days. I&#039;ve noticed a calm relax feeling.   Normally after I exercise, I still have energy. Since I&#039;ve started to take it,  I&#039;ve noticed a good calm relax tired feeling.  Not a drowsy tired, which is good.  Also,  I&#039;m noticing an attitude switch for the good.  As for weight gain,  nothing yet and I hope it stays that way.  I&#039;m eating much better and exercising more to balance just in case.  I definitely  feel a change for the good. Hopefully this is a fix until I can do it off medicine.  If not,  it is what it is. I&#039;ll keep an open mind.

Let me know if anyone has anything different.""",6
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""Being 32 and having cancer four times, I realized that I had a serious anxiety disorder. I did not believe in a &quot;pill&quot; but eventually, I realized that something had to change. I tried Welbutrin for a while, which made me feel bipolar and then I switched to Lexapro for several years. The problem with Lexapro was that I didn&#039;t feel anything good or bad. I know that you might think that&#039;s a blessing, but it&#039;s truly not. After gaining over 20 pounds, my doctor suggested that I switch to Cymbalta, which I was very nervous about, but I knew something had to change. I have been on Cymbalta for 3 months now and it is working. I think the worst part is the constipation! I also have broken out in several rashes on my face while &quot;drinking.&quot;""",7
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""It&#039;s a wonderful knock out punch if everything else has failed, or if you&#039;ve taken something like Ambien and it stops working. For me Ambien was great until it stopped working, I then tried Trazodone but that didn&#039;t help much. Seroquel is an antipsychotic but at small doses (25-50mg) it only hits histamine receptors so its like a large dose of Benadryl- but much better then Benadryl. Only downside is that it is a little hard to get out of bed the next day but you will sleep like a bear so it&#039;s worth it. Takes about an hour to an hour and a half to kick in and 25 mg does the trick for me. Also, there is no weight gain at small doses so that&#039;s nice too.""",0
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""For all you strugglers out there, there&#039;s an amazing drug called Seroquel.  It will put you to sleep in an instant each and every night, I promise you.  Just be careful what you wish for.  The side effects are killer.  I&#039;m going onto Belsomra in a few days.  I long for all the side effects you complain about.  I think I would lie awake for a month if it meant I could get off Seroquel.  But I sleep like the proverbial baby.  I thought I was the only person in the world who suffered this much """,0
Toradol,Pain,"""I was given this medication the first time in a walk in clinic in the form of an IM injection. I don&#039;t know the dose but it worked magically! I have been suffering from severe migraines for over 20 years. I also take Zomig as needed. I told my GP about the effects I had with Torodol. I have tried literally everything for my migraines from natural treatment to every recommended medication. Nothing works to stop like this medication and sometimes I have to combine with the Zomig. I&#039;m happy it isn&#039;t a narcotic and doesn&#039;t give me that looped out feeling. I just want to feel normal and this seems to help when I have severe pain of migraines. The doctor gave me an oral prescription which isn&#039;t as fast as the injection but it still seems to work.""",9
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""This has been a miracle! I went from avoiding everyone and everything even cleaning or talking to friends. I&#039;ve started doing everything around the house, I&#039;ve been able to stand up for myself. I&#039;m happy every day. Gone are the I&#039;m having a bad day, only drawback 1st 3 weeks I had to take it at bedtime because I was very nervous and jittery, that subsided, no problems with stomach have not lost any weight but I&#039;m much more active. Like night and day difference. I&#039;m so happy.""",6
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""Of all medications I have taken for mental illnesses, Seroquel has been the most effective. It started working almost immediately. At first 25mg nightly, then 50mg, to 75mg, to 100mg only at bed time due to the drowsiness that accompanies it. I now take 150mg at bed and 25mg with breakfast and 25mg at lunch time which is keeping anxiety at bay. It required an increase monthly for me until now. The biggest benefit was treatment of insomnia, which in turn helped me manage my days better. It hasn&#039;t been effective in preventing or even reducing the effects of mania which is why it didn&#039;t get a full 10/10 from me. The worse side effect has been the constant weight gain.""",6
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""This stuff works great at first. I took it for both insomnia and mild anxiety, and within 20min I was so relaxed and could fall asleep like nothing. Unfortunately my tolerance built up so quickly; I went from 0.5mg a night to 2mg a night in just 2 months just for it to keep working. And coming off of it is extremely difficult. VERY heightened anxiety and terrible withdrawal symptoms. It took me nearly 2 months to get off it completely.""",0
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""My husband and I were on Adipex for 3 months before I got pregnant with our son. I had to quit taking it of course. However, our first month I lost 18lbs and my husband lost 29! In the 3 months we were on it we lost a total of 105lbs! It is definetly the best diet pill ever. The only thing I didn&#039;t like was that my mouth was always dry. I couldn&#039;t go anywhere without a bottle of water in my hand.""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the implant in January 2015, &amp; removed late January 2016.. 

Before getting the implant, I was very much into fitness. I had energy and was always active. When I got the implant, my trainer noticed my lack of energy. Fast forward about 3 months.. I was so exhausted &amp; fatigued I didn&#039;t want to do anything but sleep. I was at a plateau with my weight loss &amp; started getting depressed.. THEN I found out I needed surgery to remove an ovarian cyst. Throughout the year I gained nearly 50 lbs, was fatigued, and the last 6 months had horrible, HEAVY, periods.. I already feel better since having it removed.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started phentermine about 3 weeks ago and lost 10 lbs so far but may be more and definitely the inches are gone, but starting yesterday I started experiencing some chest pains and shortness of breath and its like a little pressure sitting on my chest/lungs. My doctor appointment is not until Tuesday but I will stop for now. I hate that because these pills do work, I have more energy, eating way less. I was just hungry all the time for no reason and it was hard for me to lose weight, exercising daily. My mom uses them and she hasn&#039;t had any side effects. She has lost 21 lbs so far. So my doctor may take me off, so if that%u2019s the case I will definitely have to buckle down and stay focused to lose the weight. Good Luck to everyone else.""",3
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I had my implanon inserted March 2011. I like the IDEA of the implanon, but HATE the side effects. The initial insertion was painless. No swelling, little brusing, no bleeding from the site. I&#039;ve been super moody, mean almost! I&#039;ve had menstrual bleeding for 11-21 days (at the longest) a month, muscle aches, ABSOLUTELY no sex drive (which is a complete 180 to before the Implanon) and I&#039;ve actually been caught yelling at my 1 year old. This implant is good in that you don&#039;t have to think about taking a birth control pill everyday, but it shouldn&#039;t change the person you used to be. I&#039;m scheduling to have mine removed shortly after Christmas.""",8
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I started taking Busbar earlier this year.
I&#039;m unable to work due to severe depression, severe anxiety, and PTSD.  Initially, it eased my muscles and eased my anxiety better than xanax.

Since I have been on it, my face is fat and I&#039;ve gained weight in places where I have never had a problem.  My formerly long thick hair is thin.  My skin became thin and dry.  At one point, I had patches of hair missing; through prayer, it&#039;s coming back.

Today I was so disgusted with the changes and prayed for a reason as to why these things were happening.It came to me to look up the side effects of busbar and BAM, they were all there.  

Warning this stuff can cause alopecia.  I&#039;m going to stop taking it.""",7
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I struggle with PTSD and being able to relax and fall asleep and stay asleep at night due to my anxiety and PTSD. My problem with most sleeping meds is that they tend to give me awful nightmares (my whole point of taking sleeping pills is to relieve those nightmares) so others haven&#039;t been effective. This medication on the other hand has helped me a lot. I have pleasant dreams and no side effects. I don&#039;t wake up if at all in the middle of the night. If anyone else has these same issues I do I would recommend it for sure.""",0
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""My 6 yr old son started showing signs of ADHD a year ago. He is in kindergarten and he has 3 types of days green- good, yellow-not the best, red-bad day. Every week he was coming home with 2 yellow days a week for calling out and being disruptive for the last 7 months. He started taking Focalin XR 10mg and has a green day everyday since he started the medication. His teachers say how much better he has been at school and he doesn&#039;t run a muck through the house anymore. I&#039;m so happy we found Focalin.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I began taking adipex in 7/31/15.  I weighed in at 204.4 at my annual Gyn appt and was disgusted that I had let myself get that heavy.  I hadn&#039;t weight that much when I was pregnant with my kids.  I am 5&#039;8&quot;.  My goal was to lose 15 pounds by Labor Day.  I was down 17 by that point.  I am now 22.4 pounds down and beginning my last month on it.  I use my fitness pal and try to keep to 1200 calories per day, high in protein.  I generally get in 4-7 miles a day walking and do a 25 minute exercise video 6 days per week.  I am hopeful that I have finally changed my lifestyle.  I needed the jumpstart.  Only side effects early were dry mouth - I drink lots of water.  I plan to cut down to 1/2 pill a day this month.  Love how it&#039;s working.""",3

Really painful cramps once I got home for about 4 hours took aleve to help. Day 2: No cramps light spotting as expected. Days 3-12: Mostly just spotted lightly and had light cramps on and off. 2 of those days I had normal bleeding I needed a tampon. Had several migraines. I get those sometimes  so idk if this had anything to do with that. Day 13-today: No bleeding no cramps no pain during sex. Partner can&#039;t feel the strings. Haven&#039;t had any migraines.

Paxil,Anxiety,"""My entire life since a young child I&#039;ve been fighting post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. I didn&#039;t even know it until I was about 22. I was in a very bad car accident and it changed my life and worsened my anxiety. My panic attacks were so bad I&#039;d be just sobbing and screaming and crying and freaking out in waves throughout the whole day. I finally sucked up my pride and admitted something was wrong and I needed to see a Doctor. I went and he immediately put me on 20 mg dose. It was great I did calm down quite a bit and when I&#039;d have flashbacks it came without panic attacks. It&#039;s been a year and I&#039;ve hit the poop-out.

Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""On it for 5 months now, and all I have to say is WOW. I have battled nervousness, anxiety and a very, very low stress threshold for all my life (I&#039;m 32 now). It all changed when I started taking Concerta. Started with 16 mg., and felt a lot more relaxed, but also started to develop a foggy kind of feeling in my head. After 2 weeks the dose was upped to 36, and the foggy feeling subsided a bit. Then on 54mg. 2 weeks later, it was like I could see things more clearly. My memory improved, I&#039;m &#039;sharper&#039;, actually feel smarter. All of my anxiety, nervousness etc. is gone. cons: had a persistent fungal infection for a while (on my foot) allergic reaction (redness), &amp; slight tinnitus, but all in all very, very satisfied. A life saver for me!""",1

Differin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had bad skin since 4th grade, I never did anything about it I would just wear makeup and coverup, last year in grade 9 I went on the pill for my skin, it completely cleared the acne on my back and chest but my face was still bad. I eventually got put on differin gel, and within the first week my skin was clear for the first time! But I began getting a red rash on my face and my skin was peeling and very sensitive to anything else I put on there, even my makeup. I&#039;ve now been using it for about 4 months, to anyone who is looking to go on differin gel I highly recommend it, but do not judge your skin within the first few weeks because your skin will be getting used to it. I now have completely clear skin and am very happy.""",4
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I experienced depressive episodes once every 10 years or so, 18 months duration. When my husband died suddenly of coronary problems in &#039;89, I was in a down stage--which didn&#039;t change until the Dr. and I found Lamictal. Tried 11 meds before without result, still locked into depression. Was tired or hyper while we worked out the dosage. Very slight hair loss was a small price to pay for a new life! Friends even remarked on the favorable attitude change. I can&#039;t thank the developers enough and it&#039;s a shame it doesn&#039;t work for all bipolar II sufferers!""",6
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I started taking Trazadone 50mg after being diagnosed with depression and anxiety plus insomnia in January. I have been seeing my GP for four years on and off with insomnia and twice a year would leave the surgery with a few diazepam for a couple of nights sleep. Then an epiphany moment came whilst reading a magazine, my insomnia was caused by the menopause! Trundled back to my GP who did blood tests which established that although young at 43 I was in fact well and truly into the menopause. My Trazadone dose went from 50 to 100mg and then to 150mg at bedtime. I have been taking this dose now for six months and have not noticed any improvement in my sleep. I constantly wake between 3 and 4am every night unless I take one Lorazepam tablet?""",0
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I feel like Klonopin has turned my life around. I suffer from social anxiety. It has given me confidence in my job and in my everyday life. I feel in control and relaxed when I am on this medicine. It&#039;s similar to Xanax but it takes about 40 minutes to an hour to kick in and it lasts a lot longer. Being in crowds doesn&#039;t bother me as much. It sort of slows things down and doesn&#039;t make things so hectic and crazy. Although things may be going on around you, you seem to not notice it as much. It&#039;s unbelievable how different I feel. My dosage is 1mg total a day (super low). I found 0.5mg to be too much so I take 0.25 mg four times a day. I feel like myself again. I&#039;ve had zero side effects with the exception of 0.5mg making me very drowsy.""",7
Yasmin,Acne,"""Today I&#039;ve been on Yasmin for 4 weeks. I started taking it mostly because of My skin, I have had mild hormonal acne since I was twelve (I&#039;m 18). My skin has Always been combination with a more oily T-zone and  dry cheeks. The surface of the skin dries out easily though, maybe because of the retinoid gel I used. 

I&#039;ve not looked this good since I tried antibiotics (It came back afterwards)  and when I get pimples, one wash with my estee lauder cleansing make them go away overnight. Its a commitment though, I started on the first day of My period and i had a 2 week long period   spotting everyday for the last 2 weeks. My breasts grew two sizes as well, and i lost most of My appetite. makes me dizzy sometimes. Otherwise:perfect.""",4
Anacin,Pain,"""Any time that I have pain from over exertion resulting in muscle pain or an infrequent headache my go to medicine is Anacin. For me it works FAR better than Advil, Aleve, Tylenol or Aspirin. This week I had pain from running and had no relief from other products but once I found Anacin I had relief within 1 hour and the relief has lasted. Once, when I had minor surgery the Anacin worked much better than Tylenol 3 that was prescribed for me. I have no idea why Anacin works better for me but it always has.""",9
Viibryd,Depression,"""I&#039;m so happy to see that many people have had positive results from this medication.

I was on it for 5 days and had diarrhea so bad I had to stop.  I lost 5 pounds in 2 days (granted I&#039;d like to lose a few, but not like that).  I&#039;ve been off of it for 1 day now and I&#039;m still running to the bathroom (it&#039;s not as bad, but painful).

I wish I would have had the experience others have had. But this drug just isn&#039;t for me.  Unfortunately, it seems that most antidepressant cause a number of side effects for me.  Keeping me stable is a challenge.  (I have bi-polar disorder)""",5
Effexor XR,Depression,"""I can explain this drug easily. It will take away your problems, BUT...your sleep won&#039;t be effective, you will have extreme memory problems, you won&#039;t experience vibrant emotion (it&#039;s always dull), did I mention you will be tired literally all day within minutes of waking? You will basically be a living zombie where every action you take feels forced and fake. You will gain a ton of weight. I was a bodybuilder, 200lb 7.5% bodyfat year round. Counted calories constantly. Still did on effexor, counted them all the way up to 4k a day along with 4-6 beers and no weight lifting. I just didn&#039;t care. I&#039;m 215lbs at 28% bodyfat. If you don&#039;t know what that means, basically I traded a 6-pack for a keg. Went from a size 32 to a size 38. In 8 months""",5
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""my son was for a short period of time on tenex for impulsive control at the age of 8 years  it kind of worked since it turned him into a zombie he had no energy was starting to nap after school he has not napped since he was a baby. we took him of tenex after a few weeks. for last 3 years after stopping the Meds he is complaining about headaches and has random nose bleeds&#039; think the biggest mistake we made was listen to the Dr. and teachers pushing Meds.""",1
Tretinoin,Acne,"""This medication is extremely effective when used properly. I developed whiteheads on my cheeks and had rather large pores on my nose with blackheads. I have been using the medication for a total of six months now. Initially, I had some redness, moderate peeling, and some slight burning right after applying the medication. After about three weeks, the side effects subsided and I started to notice my skin clearing, pore size minimizing, and an overall evening of complexion. I used Phisoderm Deep Cleansing face wash morning and night and then used Neutrogena Oil-free moisturizer with SPF 15 in the morning. My face is very oily so I did not experience much dryness.""",4
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""My Dr. in NYC took me off of Halcion (which worked great!) and put me on Ambien when it came out being touted as a &quot;miracle sleep aid&quot;. Doc told me that it was non-habit forming, if it worked for me I wouldn&#039;t ever need to use more than the 5 mg. tabs (sounded like she had just memorized company literature). Anyway the .5 mg. Ambien worked great for a while, especially helpful as my work schedule(s) varied so much. I&#039;d sleep and wake up refreshed. But after 7 or 8 yrs. of taking .5 mg several nights a week, I needed 10 mg. to get &amp; stay asleep. Then it stopped working. Fact is, you have to go off Ambien for a while until your &quot;tolerance&quot; goes away &amp; I&#039;ll bet that&#039;s the case with all sleep aids - it&#039;s back to Halcion for me!""",0
Hydroxyzine,Pain,"""I have a very high tolerance for meds (all meds) always have, even as a child.  Woke up in the middle of surgery at 7, after give twice the adult dosage bc I couldn&#039;t go to sleep.  I noticed on opiates they help but minimally.  I noticed for a brief period when I had benzo&#039;s for my anxiety, it aided my pain meds.  But they took me off for another kind and my opiates for pain and anxiety relief weren&#039;t being helped at all.  They just switched me and I notice the same aid to my medication the benzo&#039;s provided minus the fog.  It doesn&#039;t help with my severe chronic pain on its own (I wish it were that easy) but I find that my meds works so much better in conjunction.  My gabipentin seems to work better too. :) finally I can live a little better""",9
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""On day one, I noticed a calmness come about me. Now I&#039;m on day 6 of 20 mg and still calm but, not emotionless. I love that I&#039;m not quick to anger anymore. I am having minor panic attacks however. The doctor said it may take a full 6 weeks to feel the full effects. I was having serious panic attacks at night in my sleep and those have gone away. I keep clenching my jaw, that started on day 2. I am really tired like I&#039;ve taken a Benadryl and I have to nap or I wont make it to bedtime. I am enjoying life much more though and I&#039;m seeing all of the things I missed because I couldn&#039;t relax or enjoy the moment. I have two months of pills and then the doctor wants to see me so hopefully shes not going to pull me off. I feel like a new woman.""",7
Bupropion,Anxiety,"""I am on 150 mg of the generic bupropion for approximately 2 months now. The side effects have been increased anxiety and irritability as well as really bad insomnia. Went to see the doctor and they increased it to 300mg a day. I am skeptical, thinking it will intensify the side effects but they are telling me it should decrease them with a higher dose. I went in to change to a different medicine, we&#039;ll see what happens. I still don&#039;t understand doubling the dose.""",7
Copper,Birth Control,"""I was on mirena for 3 1/2 yrs, mirena was ok for me in the beginning, however I started realizing I gained a lot of weight I mean ALOT from 120 to 160lbs, I also had no sex drive at all I literally didn&#039;t want anything at all with my husband, to the point that it was more of a duty than a pleasant experience for me. I decided to switch birth controls, I overall didn&#039;t mind the iud&#039;s , I got the paraguard on 02-29-2016 , I noticed spotting for the first 3 days then I was ok. It stopped. One week no bleeding no cramping nothing I was feeling normal again. I started my period on March 14th and is already March 21st and I am still with my period. I think is normal due to me not having a period for 3 1/2 yrs . sex drive coming back so I&#039;m happy :-)""",8
Kapvay,ADHD,"""My son has used various stimulants for 5 yrs.  Still struggling because of impulsivity &amp; super high metabolism, the docs wanted to add non-stimulants.  We started w/ Intuiv, which dropped his bp way too low (75/43) so stopped after 2 wks.  Tried Clonidine IR and it worked GREAT the 1st 2 days, then fine (not great, just fine).  The doc changed to Kapvay for long-acting effects, but we stopped after 2 wks because he got awful insomnia (took 2-3 hrs to fall asleep instead of his usual 15 mins).  Last night we went back to Clonidine IR - he fell asleep quickly and slept great!  I give Kapvay a 2 because it decreased his impulsivity a bit, but the insomnia was awful, he got more aggressive/emotional, and really affected him negatively.""",1
Dapsone,Acne,"""So I&#039;ve been on Aczone for 3 full days now, and I know that&#039;s not long but I&#039;m really impressed with this stuff! I had a sudden and embarrassing breakout on my chin/mouth area from switching to another oral birth control (instead of large cystic acne it was tiny red breakouts everywhere) and I saw an ad for this so I decided to give it a try. Immediately the next say I saw it was drying a few pimples! On day 3, id say half my acne is healing or gone. I&#039;m hoping a week from now my acne will be mostly gone. It can be drying but not anything crazy. I use the 5% gel in the morning and at night, along with my cetaphil cleanser. I don&#039;t use lotion at night but in the morning I use philosophy clear days ahead lotion and some makeup. I&#039;ll update!""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started using it in April, at the beginning of April I weighed 200lbs. At the end of April I weighed 182. I didn&#039;t take it for the next month and still weigh 182. I am starting to take it again, so hopefully I can keep losing weight. 

When I started to take it I felt a little addicted. Couldn&#039;t go to sleep and got moody, that all went away after the first week of taking it. And now I love it.
I exercise every so often, but try to do activities more than exercise. If you do activities that keep you up and moving, you can lose the weight.

As far as food goes at first I couldn&#039;t eat much and didn&#039;t want anything greasy, it made me want healthy food. I try to eat very little amounts of food that is fruit or something with a lot of protein.""",3
Monodox,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this medication for nearly 3 months now and I had under skin acne or blackheads I tried deep cleansing for a year and many other medications I tried retin-a and it removed my under skin blackheads but made my skin red .. After I used this pill it actually worked really well at least until now.  I recommend this as it made my skin better. But I don&#039;t know if I stop taking it my acne will come back or not. And the beautiful thing about this medication is that u don&#039;t have to worry about your skin anymore because its clear""",4
Desoxyn,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been taking desoxyn for 6 yrs now for ADHD and TRD (treatment resistant depression). Before this I had been mostly bed bound for nearly twenty years due to severe depression until I switched pdocs.  I am SO glad I did! Now when I wake up in the morning I have hope, and now I am actually happy to be alive.  Long ago I tried ritalin, but had only bad effects.  I&#039;m no longer a burden to my family! The day I started it was like a switch turned on and life turned around. I graduate from college soon and even have a fiance and friends. Unbelievable! I tried so many things (inc ECT) before this drug and can&#039;t understand why this wasn&#039;t tried FIRST? If you have been suffering like me beg your doctor for this.

My starting weight was 220 lbs. as of this morning I&rsquo;m 210 lbs.  I&rsquo;ve tried every weight loss program you can imagine and nothing has come close to this weight loss.

I will update this post if I can find it again.""",2
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I have a different experience than these reviews I am reading here.  I do not think this is the best drug ever and really have a hard time believing the 9 and 10 ratings.  But also this drug is not a total dud and does not deserve so many low scores.  To me this is the second best drug I have tried for insomnia.
After many years of struggling including lost work days, Ambien was a miracle to me and since going on it 8 years ago. I only needed about 5mg each night to be out and have 0 side effects from the stuff.  But I want a safer alternative at least for some of the time.  Belsomra seems to be fitting that need.  While it is not even close to being as effective or side effect free as Ambien, it is much better than Sonata or Rozerem.  I do need a higher 20mg dose for the stuff.  It usually kicks in after about 45 minutes and consistently puts me to sleep at that dosage. I have been learning to manage a slight headache / dehydration effect from it by keeping a water bottle by my bed.  I am slightly drowsy for a couple hours in the AM (although it wears off completely and am fine by about 9am).""",0
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""The first night I took 1 and I slept so good, but that is probably also because I was running on 2 hours of sleep that day.  2nd night I took 2 at 10pm and finally fell asleep at 4am.  3rd night I took 2 at 1am, took another half at 5:30am and took the other half (total of 3 pills) at 8:30am, finally fell asleep at 9am.  Doctor told me I wouldn&#039;t have the groggy feeling when I woke up.  I was so groggy the last 2 days that I had taken it the night before.

Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I am 7 years post gastric bypass had lost 90 lbs, had a baby and gained back 40lbs mostly because I was hungry all of the time.  I should have talked to my surgeon sooner.  My daughter is now 4 and I just talked to him last week.  He said it is common and in his experience qsymia works well because it stops the hunger and allows the surgical tool to work again.  Okay.. worth a shot, even at the cost. I was 194 last Tuesday. It is Monday and I am 188. I&#039;d say it works pretty damn well. I have not been hungry at all  I have had some strange side effects. Day 2 was the worst with some confusion and fatigue but it passed soon enough. Today I have some tingling in my face that I am really hoping is related to waxing and not the drug.""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Nexplanon about a month and a half ago. As I&#039;ve only ever used low dose estrogen birth control pills, Nexplanon sent my mood swings through the roof within the first two weeks.

The mood swings aren&#039;t really happening anymore, I don&#039;t feel depressed/anxious/sad at all. My skin completely cleared up and I&#039;ve been losing weight.

Actually, I lost about 5 lbs the first month which is why I kept going, but regained that 5 and finished 6 months (at great expense!) with no weight loss. I will say I also had zero side effects.

After two days of taking it I knew that if I stayed on it, I would be at risk of suicide to stop that horrible feeling.  Taking it made me stay awake for two days, fretting with anxiety.  I spoke to my doctor the first chance I got and she immediately took me off of it.  I&#039;m on other medications now and very stable for years.""",6
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""The weight loss clinic gave me 75 mg which I break into 3 and take 1/3 a day. I don&#039;t take it until around 10:30 am and it works pretty well but starts making me jittery and anxious around 4 or 5 pm. I am extra sensitive to medication and need very little. Problem is I drink wine to get rid of the jitters and then start eating in the evening. The first time I used it I lost 19 pounds. This time I lost about 5 and lost my motivation. I only need to lose about 10 pounds at this point but am stuck. I run so get plenty of exercise.""",2
Pristiq,Bipolar Disorde,"""My doctor replaced Prozac with Pristiq in hopes it would be more effective in fighting my depression.  At first I thought I was in heaven.  I&#039;m in my late 50&#039;s and never felt this good ever.  I also lost 30 lbs!  As time passed, I became more and more manic. (not a feel good manic either).  Had to get off of it.  Shame.  When it was working for me it was better than anything I&#039;ve ever tried.""",6
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I had tried over 15 other medications including lithium before going on abilify to stop severe episode of mania. I have been on 30 mg dose for 10 years with no side effects and no manic episodes since starting this med. It is definitely my &quot;miracle&quot; drug. I also took cymbalta for 9 years with fairly good results, but still experienced some depression. recently switched to pristiq which seems to be working so far. Also take focalin for attention and xanax for sleep. I work full time in a high-stress environment and was able to finish a doctoral degree with this med. I wish I knew more about the long-term effects. But I won&#039;t change it for anything.""",6
Retin-A,Acne,"""I&#039;m a young woman in my early twenties with moderate acne.  If you&#039;re just starting Retin-A, STICK WITH IT  I started using Retin-A (0.01%) every night in December of 2013.  I was very frustrated because my acne became worse for about 2 months.  However, I stuck with it and by July 2014 my acne had noticeably decreased.  It is now October 2014 and I&#039;ve been getting compliments on how great my skin looks!  For the first time in years, I don&#039;t feel like I have to wear liquid foundation to cover up my acne. If you experience flaking, remember that moisturization is key if you&#039;re using Retin-A!""",4
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I have been taking Prozac for two months.  The first month I did not notice a difference but after 6 weeks I was not obsessing or getting angry and noticed I was more relaxed around other people.  Being a shy person from the day I was born, I am still not interested in anymore social interaction, however I have noticed that I am now extremely tired on the Prozac which is debilitating and frustrating since I have an exam to write in 10 days and have no motivation to study.  I have lots of energy when I am exercising so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s due to low iron or nutritional deficiencies.  Went to doctor today and he recommended I stay on it for another month so the medicine normalizes in my body.""",5
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;m writing a review to hopefully help others who haven&#039;t taken Vyvanse yet and want some information on what to expect. I felt REALLY uneasy and nervous prior to taking my first Vyvanse dose and it was honestly not worth the worry. 

I started at 40mg to help with my ADHD. I read lots of reviews how it makes you feel high and super active. I felt a little bit of a buzz but not high. It was just a pleasant feeling of happiness. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s different for everyone, but mine wasn&#039;t extreme. I also felt like I had more energy, but not enough to obsessively clean my house like others that left reviews. 

Definitely take it early. It will keep you up otherwise. Only complaint so far!""",1
Ambien CR,Insomnia,"""I have been using Ambien CR for 3 years. I love it. I make sure to take it on an empty stomach and in 20-30 minutes I am asleep.  The only things I would warn about is: make sure you have at least 8 hours of sleep time, it doesn&#039;t work well if you eat before taking the pill, and I have done some things I have no memory of doing. My husband has tried Ambien CR and said it doesn&#039;t work on him. I would recommend Ambien CR to anyone who has trouble falling and staying asleep.""",0
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My son is 13 and has been on several ADHD medications.  I liked the Vyvance at first because I did see an improvement in his ability to sit and listen and pay attention, however it didn&#039;t last long enough.  The doctor has increased the dosage several time and now he is up to 60mg daily. The problem is that he has lost over 20lbs because he simply won&#039;t eat and now it seems after four months on this medicine its like his body has adapted to it and he is super hyper.  I spoke to the doctor about it and he said he can do real damage at his age with the weight loss and not eating and that the stimulant is actually wiring him up.  We are going to take him off of the Vyvanse and put him on a non stimulant medication.""",1
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Geodon for over 4 years now. Granted, it was tough to start this medication with excessive sleepiness, but I did not give up on it because my doctor really recommended it and we titrated up to 120 mg per day taken in 4 separate doses of 40 mg. Geodon is an integral part of my bipolar disorder regimen! It stabilizes me perfectly with lamotrigine and Wellbutrin XL. It&#039;s a miracle drug!""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Skyla about a year ago and I love it. The insertion was slightly painful but only lasted a few minutes. I was dizzy the hours after and did have some cramps but it only lasted about a day. I hardly get my period; light spotting. Although when I do get my period, I get cramps, which I never used to get when I was on the pill. Im not pregnant so that&#039;s a bonus. Overall my only complaint is the cramps I now get. I would recommend this to everyone!""",8
Remeron,Depression,"""Mirtazapine has helped me on more than one occasion.  I&#039;ve cycled through the gamut of antidepressants including but not limited to: Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, etc., but nothing really worked until Remeron.  Thought I was okay to stop all medicines a year ago and did fine for awhile but now feeling awful again; depressed and underweight.  Renewed my script today and taking my first dose of R.E.M.eron tonight.  Bring on the munchies!  I just love a donut.""",5
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""This is my first time taking Risperidone 0.5g for Bipolar Schizoaffective Disorder, and it&#039;s my first week. I have always been 100% against medication but it came to the point where I could no longer suffer alone. My mind has now changed about medication. I was concerned with bad side effects, but all I had was a feeling of slight anxiety and heightened senses days 4 and 5 only, but I pushed through and I&#039;m fine.

Although it&#039;s early days yet, I am very happy! My mind has stopped racing, I am not thinking people are judging or talking behind my back, I feel relaxed, can handle crowds and I&#039;m not angry or have raging irritability, and better sleep.

I&#039;ll give a new review within a month, but I should have done this sooner.""",6
Yasmin,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been taking Yaz for 4 months now, I&#039;m 16 years old. Few complaints, at the beginning this pill caused me horrible nausea and breast pain but that could be due to changing to Yasmin from Microgynon 30. Also I experienced spells of depressive moods which have now cleared up but I often experience mood swings! On a positive note my skin has cleared up massively and have maintained if not lost weight, great pill.""",8
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on Abilify for almost two months.  I got up to 15mg, but have taken myself down to 5mg due to several reasons.  First, I noticed rapid weight gain which surprised me, since I&#039;m very active.  Also, it made me physically very tired but restless at the same time. Going jogging felt like torture, since my limbs felt so heavy. I tried to stop taking it but experienced extreme sleepiness which is usually a sign a depressive episode is coming on.  I think it&#039;s evened out my sleeping, but I wake up pretty early on it. I take it at night now.  I&#039;m undecided whether it&#039;s worth taking, since I think my Depakote is doing a better job of stabilizing my moods, and it&#039;s cheaper.""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am 33 years old and 5&#039;3 and weigh a whopping 300 pounds.  I went on phentermine because I wanted help with portion control and weight obviously, and started on 10/20/16. I had started taking Phentermine 15mg capsule once a day for a week, then I started the 37.5 mg capsule once a day till current.  When I started on the 15 mg capsule it was great! No major concerns, just dry mouth. Now I am on 37.5 and I have major dry mouth and tingling fingers and lips. I chose to still take it.  As of 10/27/16 I got weighed and I now weigh 291.  I lost 9 pounds in a week. Yay, its working.  I am only eating right but not exercising. I highly recommend it!  I only am giving it 9 stars because of the dry mouth and tingling fingers and lips.  Good luck""",3
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m using  doxy, epiduo and differine for 3 months and it has really worked like my skin became brighter and acne has gone except some pimples I  randomly get. After the 3 months I stopped and I didn&#039;t visit my derm again. I wouldn&#039;t say that my face has back to the first situation but I started to get some red pimples . Now I m taking doxy again and m satisfied ! I highly recommend for everyone who suffers from acne""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I was prescribed phentermine/Adipex for weight loss after I discussed with my doctor my lack of energy being a full time single working mother and time and motivation were really my issues contributing to my weight. She said this would give me the motivation and &quot;want&quot; to exercise and is an appetite suppressant. Those two things are very true. I work a desk job and cannot exercise until evening so that is hard. Day 1 and 2 I was on the go all day and felt fantastic, full of energy, and very happy. Day 3 I had several negative side effects of high blood pressure, heart pounding, fatigue, insomnia. Day 4 I had the dose cut in half by my doctor. Today is Friday, day 5, and I have lost 9.5 pounds since Monday. Hoping to see more loss but slower!""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""In my last post, I had lost 8lb in 2.5 weeks. Starting weight was 181lbs, I currently weigh 168. I have been on Phentermine for about 6 weeks. I have had a busy summer, in which I would usually gain weight however, I have continued to lose even though my busy schedule makes it hard to work out every day. Currently down 13 lbs! I will begin to increase my workout schedule as I am not as busy anymore. Hoping to lose another 10-15lbs within the next 8 weeks (maybe more!).""",3
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I am 64 a have been taking Trazadone for about 7 months for insomnia .   Trazadone did not work for me at all.  It caused me to have several side effects including slurred speach,  weakness,  fatigue, flu like symptoms,  brain fog etc.  I started out taking 50 mg. I went up to 100 when it didn&#039;t work.  The withdrawals have been awfull.  Reduce 12.5 mg.  every 2-4 weeks.  Can&#039;t wait until I am free of this drug.  I did a lot of research to educate myself as to what my body was depleted of to cause insomnia. Taking natural products only now.  Melatonin, GABA, Selenium, and some others.
Kavinace, and Native Rest.  Plus some natural hormone therapy .  Have 25 mgs of Trazadone to go until I am off completely.  Sleeping good now!""",0
Percocet,Pain,"""Took the pill every six hours for two weeks after shoulder surgery to deal with the immense pain. It worked! Then I stopped one day. Big mistake. The withdrawal took a week and I felt like going to the ER. No one told me to taper off. The pain became unbearable again especially after physical therapy and now I only take one an hour before PT. Bottom line, it works but is a narcotic so addiction CAN happen and withdrawal must be executed carefully.""",9
Diclofenac,Pain,"""I have had neck pain, stiffness and spasms in my shoulder and neck for over two years. I had multiple MRI scans to try and diagnose where the pain was coming from. Two days after taking Voltaren in tablet form the symptons seemed to dissapear! I feel alive again and can&#039;t believe the relief it has given me. I&#039;m not 100% back to normal but I&#039;m nearly back to full health now. Fantastic stuff !""",9
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have taken OTC to ambien and lunesta. There  is no similar comparison. This is my miracle drug for insomnia. The bad taste is actually to help you remember you took the drug. It was designed for those who wake at night and need to go back to sleep thus again helping remember you took it. You can break them easy and can take 1/2 before bed and one if you wake up. Use the free trial and down load the coupon card for the rest of the year. You will not be disappointed in the medication. Make sure the pharmacy &quot;hooks&quot; it to the script every time. They seem to forget. Too expensive of a tier as it is!""",0
Mirena,Birth Control,"""Reasons for the 9/10:

1) Cramping/spotting for 4-6 mos. My 1st time on Mirena, no period for 4yrs! 6yrs later, &amp;6 days into 2nd Mirena I&#039;ve got typical cramps/3.5d menstruation.

2) It could fall out/re-position itself in the cervix, (down from uterus). 5mos after a copper/hormone-free IUD, I found out that this had happened to me and I switched back to Mirena.

Many people have had adverse effects from this med. incl. depression, anxiety, mood swings, constant spotting, painful cramps+.

Having 5 years of experience on this med., then switching to a copper IUD for 5mos, I can say that Mirena has HELPED my depression/anxiety.  Every body is different. Plus I&#039;m not going to get pregnant! So, all in all, I&#039;d recommend this to anyone.""",8
Copper,Birth Control,"""I got the Paraguad inserted a few days before I left for France. I took the pill that softens your cervix the night before and Advil a few hours before. I was also on my period which supposedly makes the insertion easier. The procedure barely hurt at all! Just a little discomfort like a Pap smear but for slightly longer. I had moderate period craps that day and I was back to normal the day after! After day one, I have felt to good! I feel invincible and excited to know that I will not be having any accidental babies! I love not worrying about having to take the pill. I am curious how this will affect my next period but so far I love it so much and the procedure seriously was not bad for me at all. Good luck guys!""",8
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""You don&#039;t need it.
It helped at first. After about a year of regular use, it stopped helping, and instead made me very angry. By then, I was taking around 5mg/day, and had a long taper ahead of me to ease the hellish physical dependency.
You don&#039;t want the taper. You don&#039;t want to numb your feelings with this horrible tranquilizer. You are worth more and you have more in you than you want to believe when you sign up for this cop-out nightmare.""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 16, and have been taking Concerta for about a year now. It works well and really helps me focus, but I do have a lack of appetite and trouble sleeping. Neither of those are really bad though. My 2 biggest complaints are first that I feel less creative while I&#039;m on it and second, when I don&#039;t take it now my concentration is horrible, and I get less done than before I started taking it.""",1
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Have been on Saphris, Trileptal, and Effexor for about 3 years now for Bi-Polar disorder and depression.  I take 5mg of Saphris before bed and I can only sleep about 2 hours if I miss a dose of Saphris.  Otherwise, I sleep about 9 hours of deep and restful sleep.  I do not function well.  Not sure which drug is responsible, but I have issues with focusing and memory that I never had before.  I still have thoughts of suicide almost daily, but this is the best I&#039;ve functioned on any drug and I&#039;ve been on them all except Lithium.""",6
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I first tried Bontril about 7 years ago when I went to a weight loss center. I lost 47 pounds and kept if off for about three years. I remember taking two pills 30 minutes before each meal. 354mg tabs and I was told not to take my last dose after 4pm due to it will keep you from sleeping. I also followed a high protein diet. I was like 190 pounds then and I think I got down to 147. but over the years I&#039;ve gained weight, had a baby and gained more weight. I&#039;m now 235 pounds and started taking bontril a week ago and I&#039;ve lost 4 pounds in a week, I was told to take 1 pill a hour before meals, I&#039;ve increased to 2 pills before breakfast and 2 before lunch and 1 in the evening and I have no appetite I have to make myself eat. I hope this continue""",2
Bupropion,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m giving this two stars because it helped me quit smoking, but that&#039;s all it did.  I&#039;ve been taking for almost two months now and my anxiety has greatly intensified.  I also have muscle aches in my legs and back - not sure if it&#039;s related to the bupropion, but I didn&#039;t have these feelings before I started taking it.  It did not help me lose weight, but I did finally plateau after gaining consistently on Paxil and Abilify.  I&#039;m still taking Abilify so maybe that&#039;s interfering with weight loss, I&#039;m not sure.   Also my depression was under control for awhile but with the relentless anxiety about everything, it&#039;s creeping back in.  Everything feels like an effort and all I want to do is stay in bed all day.  This medication is not for me.""",6
Pristiq,Depression,"""I suffer from anxiety, depression and panic attacks. 9/10 because its working for me but it&#039;s only the second anti-depressant I&#039;ve used. I was prescribed Cymbalta but had terribble nausea, body tremors, hot flashes and panic attacks.  With Pristiq I had nausea for three days but it was bearable and I was really restless. I had so much energy I walked around the block 3 times a day or more in the first week. It did stir up my depression and I had suicidal thoughts which is quite controversial because I never want to die and know in myself I would never do that to my girlfriend and my family I had insomnia the on the second night after starting my Pristiq but have had no insomnia ever since. All my side effects were gone after a week and then I was given a prescription for it. Life changing stuff.""",5
Prochlorperazine,Anxiety,"""For several months suffered debilitating migraines daily. My tongue went numb on the right side arms going dead on a night. I suffer with chiari malformation and a brain cyst multiple issues. Ok received 5mg of this today only took 5mg and my brain pressure relieved within 1 hour. Its the first time in months I&#039;ve felt at ease. Doctors won&#039;t accept I&#039;ve issues with chiari and the brain cyst and are refusing a brain scan follow up. I have the feeling of my brain dropping 50 times an hour mainly on a night. I&#039;m really hoping the brain drop feeling relieves tonight while sleeping. I&#039;VE HAD A GOOD 6 HOURS FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 16 MONTHS! A blessing is this for me...""",7
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""When I first started this on 10mg, I had bad sides. Insomnia, crawling skin, heart palpitations and shallow breathing. I think a lot of it was in my head and from reading too much about side effects. My doctor wanted me to go back on Celexa but I had already been on Lexapro 3.5 weeks so I asked my doc if I could stick with it. He bumped my dose up to 15mg and its now been 2 weeks on 15 mg and it has helped ALOT with my anxiety and panic attacks. I can now actually function at work. Give it a chance. I&#039;m no doctor but for me it took over 4 weeks. It worked! Hang in there.""",7
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""Still not sure is this is &quot;The One&quot; but it sure beats everything else I&#039;ve tried out when it comes to helping me stay asleep. I used to wake up multiple times a night, or I would wake and not go back to sleep. Now I wake up just once or twice and more often than not, I do eventually go back to sleep.  So I&#039;ll give it another few weeks and see if I can&#039;t sleep through the whole night.
Hopefully my sleep will continue to improve. 15 mg seems to be best for me.

Belviq,Weight Loss,"""40 year old male. I have been on Belviq for 8 weeks. I&#039;ve lost 20 pounds to date. I had a starting BMI of 32. It has totally removed my night time cravings for food. My biggest problem is late night eating. I usually eat pretty healthy during the day and ruin it at night because I am a night owl and would get hungry late night and would resort to snacks or even worse, fast food. Belviq makes me not think of food all the time and I&#039;ve noticed I&#039;m not eating as much during meal time. I try to work out 3 times a week but with my work schedule, it can be hard and some weeks I don&#039;t work out at all. I am happier and can&#039;t wait to lose more. No noticeable side effects here.""",3
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My 6 yr old son just starting taking the medicine a week ago and has been over the top emotional, a lot of crying over nothing at his daycare during the day.  He started at 10mg which did nothing but makes him cry so he went to 20mg for 3 days which seemed to work for about 2 days.  Today we put him up to 30mg to see how it goes.  I&#039;m worried about the emotional side effects and really hope that it subsides.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I started Accutane when I was 14. My skin looked  really bad. I had pimples on my face approaching the size of dimes. The acne went over my shoulders, down the front of my chest and down to the bottom of my back. 

I tried all the creams and fancy products and nothing worked. My doctor finally put me on a round of Accutane. The first dose I was on for a couple of months didn&#039;t do much, so the doctor doubled it. Within six months, my acne was almost all gone and I stopped treatment. Within 18 months I had zero acne and zero scarring - my skin was utterly flawless and still is. I am now basically cured of acne - less than half a dozen pimples in ten years. Miracle.""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;m 15, and four weeks into Accutane treatment. My initial breakout is just now dying down, and for a while I was seriously concerned. My acne for the past 4 years has been pretty horrible to deal with, but during these last few weeks is the worst it&#039;s ever been. I was also breaking out on my chest (which had never been a problem before.) I know things are getting better though, my skin looks and feels better where I&#039;m not breaking out and my scars are fading. Despite the extreme dry skin and lips, I feel that Accutane will improve my acne significantly, and I am desperately hoping that it won&#039;t return once I get off the medicines.""",4
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I started with  implanon while in high sco  l&amp; loved it. It cleared my skin, I only had 2-3 periods a year that we&#039;re very light I thought it was the best BC ever.  Well when my time was up I got a new implant by that time implanon had turned into nexplanon. My Dr. put it in my arm without going over the fact that it has much more side effects, especially for me who already has anemia, low blood sugar, severe depression &amp; anxiety, etc. Well the first year wasn&#039;t to different besides more periods that were very heavy &amp; long. Then it all got much worst my face is full of acne that I&#039;ve never ever had this bad, I&#039;m more depressed then ever with almost constant mood swings, I have no drive, constantly fatigued I can&#039;t wait to get this thing out &amp; get a non hormonal BC!!""",8
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I love my Loestrin. It was the first pill I was ever put on, and I was put on it at a young age (freshman year of high school) because my period used to be unbearable. I&#039;m talking crippling pain from cramps, to the point where I couldn&#039;t go to school for days. I went off of it for a while, for no reason other than I was too lazy to get my prescription refilled (haha). I am now back on it as a freshman in college, and I fell in love with the drug again! My skin (which I&#039;ve recently had bad acne issues for some reasons) is finally clearing up, I haven&#039;t gained a pound, my breasts are growing (thank goodness), and my period is light as a feather and only lasts two to three days. I highly suggest this pill.""",8
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""My GP prescribed this at 10mg up to 3x a day but only as needed. As in when I would start feeling an overwhelming foreshadowing to an anxiety attack. Taken as such, this medication did nothing for me. I only got like a rush of dizziness shortly after taking. So I stopped. A couple of months later I went to visit my psychiatrist on my regular visit and I explained the buspar and dosage I was told. She absolutely disagreed with my GP&#039;s dosage and informed me I should take this drug consistently 3x a day and not just as needed since this needs to build in your system to be effective. I can&#039;t say if this is AS effective for me yet as I was misinformed on dosage from my 1st doc but it&#039;s starting to work better than only taking as needed.""",7
Mirena,Birth Control,"""Just had it inserted today and it was pretty painful. I&#039;ve been bleeding for a couple months and after a d&amp;c about a week ago it hasn&#039;t gotten any better. Mirena is the next step for me to try to stop the bleeding. The insertion for me was just as painful as the endoscopy/histoscopy that I had over a month ago. It was a deep cramp with very specific pressure. I should have taken an ibuprofen beforehand to help. Obviously I have no clue how long it will last and if I&#039;ll like it in the long run but I figured I should at least share how I felt about the initial reaction""",8
Viibryd,Depression,"""Tried Viibryd about 3 years ago after trying several other anti-depressants over many years, with very little long-term benefit from any of them (Prozac, Lexapro...) After being on it for about 2 months, I forgot to take it one night, and had the worst nightmare of my life; the impact was more like a vision or prophesy. Decided after that to wean myself off, and cut pills in half. For each time I cut the dose, there was another horrendous nightmare. Was very relieved to be done with it.""",5
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking a very low dose of Seroquel (1/2 tab, 12.5 mg I think) off and on for several months now, for anxiety, depression and insomnia (off-label).  It is the most effective sleep inducer I have every taken.  The problem for me is that the effects lasts for about 36 hours, not just 8!  The whole next day is low-energy, although it is also low anxiety.  So it is good when you absolutely need to recover sleep or take a break, but I cannot use it on a regular basis at all and continue to function at work etc.""",0
Tramadol,Pain,"""This works well for me IF I take it with aspirin and tylenol. By itself, it does little - it would not be worth getting.  It also helps with sinus and/or migraines, again, only coupling it with aspirin and tylenol.  I have never had any of the &quot;interesting&quot; side effects that people describe, nor addiction.  I use it when I need it.  I can&#039;t help but think that the &quot;druggies&quot; (as someone else put it - pretty good descriptor) just THINK this stuff acts like a narcotic, and voila, placebo effect.  I just had to get a newly state mandated drug screen for this med.  I was squeaky clean, but also got a bill for $911 from the lab for the screen.  Thanks, druggies, for making it exceedingly difficult &amp; expensive for those of us who are legitimate.""",9
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Started taking Ambien 5 years ago while I was in nursing school. I would sometimes only get 45 minutes of sleep without it. With it I could easily sleep 8  hours. It worked amazingly well. Now, 5 years later, it seems I have built up quite the tolerance and sometimes need to take 2 just to make me half sleepy. Another problem is my doctor does not like to give me refills as this medicine is meant for short term use. He does refill it, but only after a long lecture every month.""",0
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I have really bad insomnia which is triggered by my depression &amp; anxiety. My shrink gave me this medicine &amp; I sleep like a baby. The thing is I started having these dreams &amp; they feel so real. But I thought this was only me until I started reading other reviews. I have to have at least 8hrs to sleep or then I&#039;m rather groggy. I&#039;m happy for the sleep because I was up for 36 hrs at a time.""",0
Concerta,ADHD,"""This is it. You might have to up or decrease you mg according to how you feel at first. I take 3, 18mg tabs in morning. It is the Concerta ER, lasts from 8-12 hrs. No side effects at all for me. I am calmer, more focused, and still get a lot done during the day. I easily go to sleep now. Recommended for ADHD though, not for ADD symptoms. I am energized during the day and do not &quot;feel&quot; like I am &quot;coming off something&quot;. I highly recommend this.""",1
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am Bipolar Type I and was switched to Saphris from Seroquel by my psychiatrist.  One dose and I began having suicidal ideation that I hadn&#039;t experienced in years. I had the presence of mind to call my psych doc immediately (it was a weekend) but she didn&#039;t call back.  I am a nurse and should have known better, but I took it the next day.  After the second dose, I was frightened I would act on the impulse.  Luckily I have a very supportive and observant husband.  I called doc again and she said to stop immediately, of course, as I should have after the first dose.  I saw her on Monday and went back to Seroquel.  Less severe side effects included numbness of my entire tongue and sick-feeling somnolence.""",6
Feldene,Pain,"""I recently had hip surgery and was in lots of pain after the operation. I tried Ibuprofen and  Voltaren with little relief. My doctor called in a script for Feldene 20 mg twice a day for me. It helped so much with the pain bringing it to a manageable level but caused the most severe constipation. So after about 5 days I switched back to Voltaren and the constipation eased up and thankfully the pain was better too.""",9
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I had a horrible experience I got it done last Friday 6/17/16. They never mentioned anything about it being painful and they never offered me any pain pills and there was no injection of analgesics to the cervix like I&#039;ve read other people getting (after the fact) It literally felt like I was going to give birth it was very painful and I&#039;m a tough cookie and I&#039;m really upset that they had to open up my cervix to do it. Yes they open up your cervix. I thought they just inserted it through the cervicle whole but no... It&#039;s only been in a day and I&#039;m having really bad cramping and headaches. I wish I never got it. I&#039;m getting it removed ASAP.  If you do plan to do it make sure you take 800 mg ibuprofen before hand.""",8
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m 52 years old and felt my life was meaningless, and extremely hard facing everyday routines and now I&#039;m sitting in the garage and feel like I could sit here all day. This is my second day and I feel the best I have in 30 years. Before I couldn&#039;t sit here without my mind racing a million times a second and getting up and feeling anxious. I took the day off from work not knowing what my anxiety was going to do, but look forward to going to work tomorrow. So far life is good and I hope this is the miracle drug I&#039;ve been longing for.""",7
Hydroxyzine,Pain,"""I was prescribed hydroxyzine for severe itch. No doctors have a clue why I have these severe itching events. But I also have other problems. I have spinal stenosis and using fentanyl 50mcg/hr every 3 days. Still recovering from colon cancer surgery. Was just diagnosed with arthritis of my hip. There are days I can not walk even with the fentanyl. Started taking hydroxyzine only when I itch and it took a few days to put 2 and 2 together and realized my back and hip almost totally stopped hurting and was able to walk without cane or walker.  Next time that I took hydroxyzine for itch, same thing, I could walk without pain. I haven&#039;t told doctor yet, wonder what he will say and if this drug helps me why didn&#039;t he give me hydroxyzine sooner?""",9
Differin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this gel for probably about 2 or 3 years now. I started getting acne in around 6th grade where as I didn&#039;t start my period until 9th grade. I&#039;ve never had SEVERE acne, there&#039;s just always been at least a couple zits on my face for as long as I can remember. I had no significant peeling or dryness when I started using differin, and I also had no immediate results. Slowly over time, however, my acne is becoming less severe and less often. Maybe it&#039;s because of the differin, maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m growing out of it. I did stop using it last summer as a test and my skin got worse and worse for the entire month I stopped using it and it took a solid 3-4 months after I started using it again for my skin to return back to normal.""",4
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I had been prescribed 1mg of Xanax before bed for severe insomnia after trying all other sleep meds with side effects,  for over 5 years and it worked great. Then I had to get a new PC and they refused to fill Xanax.. Said I needed to go to a psychiatrist for that med. Sooo ridiculous. So, instead he gave me 1mg Klonopin at bedtime. He said it was the same thing just less addictive. I&#039;ve never had an addiction problem with any meds but he felt &quot;uncomfortable&quot; giving me the rx for Xanax,  which again, worked great for me. Now on Klonopin my insomnia is worse. I can&#039;t fall asleep until 7-8am and I just lay there wide awake feeling all irritated. I now get 2-3 hours of sleep a night. Which is worse for my health than 1mg of Xanax.""",0
Trintellix,Depression,"""I was on Lexapro for about 2 years until  itstopped working. Prior to that,over the last 25 years was always on an antidepressant. You name it, I&#039;ve tried it. What the antidepressants  did for me was just take away the severe irritability that I had, I was really at a low point when my doctor asked me to try Brintellix. I had no desire to do anything.  I felt no joy. I had been taking 40 mg.of Lexapro a day. Doc said I didn&#039;t have to wean off it.  He said I could just switch, starting the next day and I did. I Started on 5mg for the first 2 wks then increased to 10mg it&#039;s only been 4wks that I have been on it and my nausea has got better, I have a clarity in thinking that I didn&#039;t have before. I feel joy now. I am staying on it.  Also, no sexual problems on it. Got Hope!""",5
Pristiq,ADHD,"""Was given a prescription to Pristiq to help with ADHD in addition to Xanax for anxiety.  The first day I noticed an improved mood, but initially thought it was the Xanax.  After taking Pristiq first thing in the morning and holding off on the Xanax, I noticed a significant improvement in mood over no medication, and a slight improvement over taking both Pristiq and Xanax.  Between the two of them, they seem to keep my anxiety and focus in a healthy range.  The only side effect I&#039;ve noticed is slight jaw fatigue from clenching.  Pretty minor though, and something I have no problem dealing with.""",1
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I&#039;m a 19 year old female and I suffer from insomnia. I talked to my doctor about my horrid sleeping habits. I have a rough time falling asleep and when I do I only get about an hour of sleep. His first thought was to prescribe a 5mg dose of ambien. I was shocked as my knowledge of the drug was that it had a heavy impact and could cause you to not remember the night you took it. When I got home that night I got ready for bed, took the dose, and laid down. After an hour or so it finally kicked in but all it did was give me a sense of not being in the correct mindset. Just being a bit off. It didn&#039;t help me fall asleep whatsoever. In fact it caused me to remain alert and awake. My results were the complete opposite of its intended use.""",0
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""I started on Zoloft, which only made the anxiety worse. Got put on Remeron after a hospital stay and it has changed my life. Started at 15mg and then shortly after increasing to 30mg. I did gain 30lbs on it due to craving sweets constantly so I tried switching to Effexor, only again having my anxiety going out of control again. I went back on Remeron 30mg and I am back to my old self. I sleep very well on this medication which for me is so much nicer despite the weight gain.""",7
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lithium was hard for me to take at first. If I did not eat enough with the medicine I would vomit. The medicine works for me but I do not like the fact that I have gained weight and it causes acne. I have done everything I can to have clear skin but it does not matter what I do. Lithium is cheap and effective but like I said I don&#039;t like the side effects. I am going to try Tegretol when I go back to the Doctor.""",6
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I have an extreme desire for sweets, Eating in the middle of the night. I Definitely lost any desire to exercise (never been like that before)!!! I&#039;m experiencing a dependency on this medication without it controlling my appetite. Within the first 6 months I got results but never reached my goal! Thinking I need more to reach desired weight loss!! Having difficulty with the idea of not taking it anymore even though I do not like my side effects.. Feeling sadness and then extreme happiness all in one day.

Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""*Update*  I&#039;m 5&#039;9, 29 yr, female, started at 266lbs. It&#039;s day 36, and I&#039;ve lost about 16 pounds.  The only thing I experienced was dry mouth within the first week. Since then that has subsided, but now my feet and hands are tingly. It&#039;s not severe but enough to be annoying. I still feel great. No other side effects. Since taking it, I&#039;m teaching myself to choose better foods and make smaller plates. Trying to establish good habits while it&#039;s easy to do so.  I haven&#039;t incorporated exercise in my routine yet, but I can&#039;t wait to see results when I do!  Still moving forward with it.""",3
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I weighed 245 about 2 years ago. Had tried phen-fen, and just about every type of diet imaginable!  I was 64 when I started. Im now at 165 (5&#039;10) and, while I could lose another 15, im not because my skin is so droopy due to years of losing/gaining hundreds of pounds (note to young women--you dont want this too happen to you) and im too old to have skin surgery. Losing weight was so easy with Belviq--feel full, no cravings and just eat less.""",3
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I&rsquo;ve been on nexplanon for 9 months 

Pros : don&rsquo;t have to worry about taking it on time, easy and fairly painless  insertion, doesn&rsquo;t have negatives of an IUD like cramping and painful sex, don&rsquo;t have to think about it, bigger boobs (some people may not like this), less periods, no babies

Cons: getting hormonal acne (I have never had acne growing up until now at 23...) , random periods that you can&rsquo;t predict (even at 9 months it will come for 3 weeks even and go away for a long time- it&rsquo;s annoying), expensive

I&rsquo;ve also have had an lower libido but not sure if it&rsquo;s from BC but my doctor can tell there&rsquo;s a lot of hormonal things going on that I haven&#039;t had before.""",8
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""Have had sleep problems for 30 years or more.Of all the meds that the doc&#039;s gave me  I do think the temazepam 30 mg works best for me. As some others have said that it should be taken at bedtime...not be on computer or tv..i will nod with the tv on but find that i fall in to a more restful sleep when i turn it off. Also for me it does not last long. 2 or 3 hours. I don&#039;t take extra doses to get back to sleep .Have been taking this for 5 years with no brain fog in the morning. Occasionally i substitute Ativan for a short time and then go back to taking temazepam . For me this seems to work well and the temazepam seems to remain quite effective.""",0
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was recently diagnosed with type 2 BP in July of 2016. I was on Lamictal at first and it was a nightmare, It kept me from being sad but I would still get very angry. Seroquel was next and I was too scared to take it at first, but once I started having a LOT of heated arguments and stress I finally decided to take it. So far so good, I only take 25mg because is chills me out and eases my anxiety. I don&#039;t get sad and I don&#039;t get overly mad or excited. First few days I am tired on the meds but after a few days I am able to manage my life. I wish I would have went to a Dr years ago to get treated because since I was 13 my moods have been up and down. Now I&#039;m as chill as a cucumber.""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve tried several options, over the counter, homeopathic, and prescription in a quest to deal with transient insomnia which typically triggers a worsened depressive mood (kind of a negative feedback loop). Ambien was one of the first I tried. It works very quickly, has very little hangover, but did not always KEEP me asleep. I usually wake around 4. 

The bad: tolerance, &quot;sleepwalking,&quot; waking up in my roommates bed with no memory of how I got there. Be cautious, if you live with other people let them know you&#039;re suffering from insomnia and that you are taking this medicine. My roommates reported me seeming completely coherent while sleepwalking%u2014 it can be more problematic than mere &quot;sleepwalking.&quot;""",0
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Latuda for just over a year. I find it very effective at eliminating my suicide ideation (I also have major depressive disorder). I take 10 to 20 mg per night. I also take 150 mg Wellbutrin XL per morning. I have had restless legs nearly my whole life at least since puberty and I am 57 years old. For about 18 months I have controlled restless legs with iron supplements. They&#039;re over-the-counter. They must be taken at least two hours after eating anything and at least two hours before eating anything in order to be effectively absorbed. I usually get relief at night by taking 28 mg equivalent tablets at mid morning and mid afternoon. Before doing this you should ask your doctor. I have had no problems from using iron. Latuda often causes restlessness, so ask your Dr!""",6
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I started on Belviq late April 2016. I told my physician that I wanted to seriously lose weight &amp; wanted something safe with not a lot of side effects to help me jump start the weight coming off.   He told me his patients that took Belviq had had good success. He is not the type of Dr. Just to pr&eacute;scribe whatever u want. He does his research and I did mine.

Today, is August 1st and I have lost 20 lbs. it&#039;s not a miracle pill, but Belviq&#039;s main purpose is to make your brain make your body feel not hungry.  I really have to work at planning out my meals.  The only side effect I have noticed is that I am tired/sleepy.  I sometimes have to drink a strong cup of coffee just to keep awake in the early evening when my husband comes from work.""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Very effective but the side effect are bad if I don&#039;t take it correctly. I think there are ways you can reduce the effects( getting correct dosage of course)
Before you consider going up a dose its worth considering. When you take them? I began taking  mine at night, but have since taking  through the day avoids headache, vision blurred, tremours. I take more last dose, breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner. 
Do you take them food?I take them with food, I defiantly feel side effect, every time if I don&#039;t eat properly and skiip a meal
Are you on any hormone treatment hrt/pill? I have found that there is a, as I call it, lower absorption rate as I&#039;m on hrt and my consultant phy agrees, so I am taking a high does.What dosage?
Even 25mg makes a difference.""",6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I developed insomnia when pregnant, nearly 16 years ago! Doctors have tried everything.Medidation. Melatonin, improving sleep hygeine, restoril, trazadone, seroquel, ambien, lunesta, and belsomra. Even when double the doses of these medicines, nothing helps EXCEPT belsomra. Granted, I have to take the max dose. But I have a 1 hour commute one way to work each day. I&#039;ve never felt drowsy, just well rested.""",0
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Tips for taking off the patch:  use oil (we use skin so soft, but any oil will work) to rub into the skin around the edges of the patch and let it sit for a little bit... maybe about 20 - 30 seconds... pull it gently while continuing to rub oil into the edges a little at a time, repeat.  The oil dissolves the &quot;glue&quot; and also helps remove the sticky residue that shows up a day later, easier to just wipe off after being sprayed with a mist of oil than scrubbed off with soap and water. 
 
Breakfast is all ready to eat when she wakes up- sometimes I make a high calorie, high nutrient smoothie and give it to her while she&#039;s still in bed,  put the patch on at the same time, let her snooze for 20 more minutes; PM gets high cal/high nutrient snack""",1
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""My GP prescribed this drug to me to help me sleep as I have Borderline personality disorder and OCD.
I was to take 1 tablet a couple hours before bedtime; I done just that.

Within an hour, I started to feel slightly paralyzed and severely slow like a sloth. By two hours I wasn&#039;t able to properly hold a sentence without slurring. I went to bed and felt like I fell asleep instantly.

The next morning on the School run I was completely unable to get up. My child stayed home and watched tv next to me whilst I slept until 12pm. I awoke feeling severely slow and like I had severe depression. The effects lasted until the next morning.

Anyhow I took half a tablet a week later and the same effects were there but not as severe.
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&#039;m very tall and very overweight. Six months on a controlled diet and exercise program yielded no results. My doctor put me on Victoza, suspecting some sort of metabolism issue (fasting blood sugar was a constant 101 for several years). Starting dose of 0.6 gave me a 20 minute headache each morning and left me lethargic. It got better in a week, upped to 1.2, same thing started. 20 minute headache, no energy. Again, it got better each day. Hit maintenance level of 1.8 and the weight began pouring off me at roughly a pound a day! A very effective appetite suppressant and my fasting blood sugar averages 91 now.""",2
Bupropion,Depression,"""I have been on over 15 different antidepressants across every category. I have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Ensam), tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs (several - Effexor, Pristiq, etc.) and nothing worked. I&#039;m taking Welbutrin 150 mg once a day (along with the Effexor XR still at 300mg) and it is incredible. I feel amazing. Unfortunately, after 3 weeks I developed hives all over my body that were itchy. While the itchiness went away after 3 days and the hives only come out at night now, my blood work shows I&#039;m having a bad reaction to it. I also lost 14 lbs in 4 weeks (a good thing). I do feel extremely anxious and agitated at times and can&#039;t stop wiggling my foot, for example. Combined with the Effexor (which causes too much sleep), my sleep is at the right length now.""",5
Mirena,Birth Control,"""The Mirena is amazing! I got mine inserted during my 6 week check up after having my son! I&#039;ve had it almost 3 years. I&#039;m 23 years old with a super busy schedule, so I didn&#039;t want pills like I&#039;ve had in the past, no time for them plus they made so sick. I wanted to try the Mirena to see if it was any different, and I&#039;m so happy I did. It wasn&#039;t painful at all to insert. It was like getting a checkup. I started my period about 4 days after insertion and that lasted about a week and a half. After that I got my period every month but it was very light and lasted about 3 days. After about 6 months I got a period every 3 months. I was scared to get it reading all the bad reviews but I decided to do it anyway.""",8
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m on a very low dose -- 5mg/day -- but have had success until recently. I have never had any side effects or ever felt &quot;drugged&quot;.  It just reduced my anxiety and tendency toward agoraphobia. Recently the agoraphobia has been winning so I have contacted my Doctor to either raise my dose or try a different medication.  I just can&#039;t get myself out the door;  it&#039;s like walking to the end of a high diving board. Stress and panic increases as I get to the end, then the horrible fall like I&#039;m having a heart attack.  Finally floating in the water I am actually fine, and even enjoy myself.  """,7
Sertraline,Depression,"""I have taken a wide selection on antidepressant drugs from imipramine, prozac, paxil, and Effexor to name a few. Prozac and Effexor being two of the worst drugs. Prozac I had chronic diarrhea and no therapeutic benefit. Effexor had no therapeutic value and left me completely sexually impotent.
Sertraline has helped with my racing thoughts and depression with little or no noticeable side effects. My experiences may not be typical for everyone, but it is the best antidepressant I have found.""",5
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Adipex on November 17, 2009. It is now January 25, 2010. I have to admit when I first started taking Adipex I felt like I was on straight speed. I couldn&#039;t sleep, eat, or concentrate. I still have bad mood swings and get upset very easily. I have no problem sleeping that wore off the 3rd week, I tend to get hungry later in the afternoon. I was taking a half of pill the first month. I take one pill a day now and do great except for my mood swings. My starting weight was 165lbs. I now weigh 138lbs. That&#039;s a weight loss of 27lbs. I still have 8lbs to go. I exercise 5 days a week on the treadmill for 30 minutes each time. If you are really wanting to lose weight and can overlook the side effects this is the pill! Good Luck!!""",3
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Buspar for over 2 years and have had a lot of success. Recently had to increase my dosage to 15mg twice a day as my anxiety started to increase this past summer for no apparent reason. I also take 60mg of Cymbalta every other day but think the Buspar is what really is working for me. I feel for all people that have issues with anxiety!

From the outset of taking this drug I had chronic diarrhoea. This lasted 4+ months and have now been diagnosed with microscopic colitis despite no previous gastric problems in my life. I&#039;ve gained the best part of a stone in weight, I was drowsy and sleeping during the daytime. The drug did not vastly reduce my anxiety or depressed moods and did not help with any pain that is caused by my osteoarthritis of spine &amp; knees. Withdrawal symptoms seem to be minimal,10 days of cessation, so fat experienced a little tearful and irritable.""",5
Xanax,Depression,"""I&#039;m 37 yrs old I have been dealing with severe depression all my life. I have tried every antidepressant medicine under the sun, some were mildly effective but the side effects were worse than the depression. I went to a new doctor and he asked if I have ever tried Xanax. I said no I thought that was used for anxiety. He prescribed me 1.5 mg a day I started noticing a difference the first day. This stuff is amazing been on it for 2 months finally some relief. Its unfortunate its abused so much and so hard to get a doctor to prescribe it. I haven&#039;t had any side effects, I have such a positive outlook on everything now. It has completely changed my life for the better. All the symptoms that come along with depression I had are gone.""",5
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Love love love this drug. It has normalized my sleep, though the initial morning grogginess was hard to deal with. However, this side effect went away after the first month or two. I&#039;m at 300mg and it has normalized my moods and has mostly gotten rid of my anxiety. The only downside is that it causes some pretty extreme &quot;munchies,&quot; which does lead to some weight gain. May also have contributed to my pre-diabetic condition.""",6
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve barely had any acne in the past then in just 2 months my face broke out like crazy and won&#039;t stop. its starting to bring my self esteem down like crazy, my acne is hormonal and my whole cheek is pigmented.

So having said that, yes adderall did help with my ability to focus, retain information, and to some degree my determination to complete tasks throughout the day. There was a huge price to pay for taking adderall for as long as I did. My metabolism slowed down immensely and maintaining the same diet and exercise I am 50lbs heavier.

Escitalopram,Depression,"""Hi, I&#039;m a recently divorced dad with 3 children. My entire life was turned upside down and inside out. I lost all my friends, went from being financially secure to having a 500k mortgage at the age of 47. I was living in total darkness and totally dysfunctional, finding faults, especially in my current partner and her children. My self esteem was non existent. I&#039;m taking Lexapro 10 mg a day and now I feel like I could carry the entire universe on my shoulders and could concur the world.""",5
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking Contrave for about a year and a half now. Within the first 3-4 months I lost a total of 32lbs. I have never had any side effects while on it. The reason it does not get a perfect rating is because last October a new company purchased and started producing it. Since then they have been price gauging and ripping people off. The previous company charged $60/bottle; the new company charges $90. Good luck finding an insurance company that covers it; 99% don&#039;t. My doctor and I are looking for other options now. Not very many people can afford paying over a $1000/yr for medicine. Unless they lower the price I don&#039;t foresee them lasting much longer, which is sad because it really is a great medication.""",3
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on the Depo shot for years and decided to change to the Skyla. Since I haven&#039;t had a period in a few years the dr decided to go ahead and put the Skyla in. It was extremely painful guess due to the fact that I wasn&#039;t on my period when your cervix opens slightly. The dr had to give me an injection inside down there to open my cervix slightly but it was extremely painful. I recommend that if your on Depo and want Skyla, wait till you have your period.""",8
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""First time I was prescribed quetiapine, when I was going through a really bad period (life problems, depression), it did not help me a thing. Was put on sleeping meds to get through the toughest time.
My doc returned me on it now much later when I started having problems to sleep a normal night, instead it was like 2-3-4 hours. Now the dose is 100-200, it ensures I can sleep 8-10 hours and return to sleep if woken up.""",0
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""Starting Lexapro was tough.  Shivering with stomach cramps, for a week I constantly felt like I had taken some bad, terribly impure Ecstasy.

Once I became acclimated to the drug, my postpartum anxiety disappeared; however, I was incredibly fatigued during the day.

I also stopped caring about most things in general.  My house wasn&#039;t as clean and creative endeavors came to a halt.  My short term memory declined.  It felt like my brain was muffled.

I experienced lucid, unnerving dreams/nightmares most nights while taking Lexapro.

I gained 8 pounds in the 8 months I took it, all in my middle.  It took a long time to get this off afterward.

Getting off Lexapro was also tough, with back pain, insomnia, and 10 days of &quot;brain zaps&quot;.""",7
Propoxyphene,Pain,"""I found this bottle from June 2010 that I was given at the emergency room. I can&#039;t remember what my visit was for but I have had a migraine since Saturday. I grabbed this bottle in desperation and it was like a miracle. The pain slid away from my head like taking a wig off. My vision is somewhat returning but the pain relief was amazing. I want to talk to my neurologist about a prescription to keep on hand""",9
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""This is a fantastic medication. For years I have dealt with severe cases of sleepwalking that doctors were unable to find a solution for. A family member one night gave me a seroquel 25 milligram tablet and for the first time in years I had a zero sleepwalking. I immediately went to my physician and told him of the fantastic progress this medication has made. He first prescribed me 25 milligram dose at bedtime this over the first month increase to 250 milligrams which I feel is an absolutely fantastic dose for me. I have taken this medication now at the 250 milligram dose and find it still works amazingly. I get an absolutely complete night sleep and no side effects in the morning. I was never a morning person do to sleep walking. 100% better""",0
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I am on my third box of Saxenda and I have not lost one ounce.  I had lost 50 pounds on my own but couldn&#039;t go any further.  My doctor recommended Saxenda.  I started August 22 and it is now November 16.  I went back to the doctor and he stated I am the only one who has not lost of the patients he recommended.  He even laughed and said I must be getting the fake pens.  He wants me to continue and stated he would ask the rep the percent who this has not worked for.  The company and the girl asked the batch number but I was at work so I did not have that information.  A nurse was suppose to call me after 3:00 pm but I have not heard anything from anyone and that was at least a month ago.""",2
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""I have been on Cymbalta for about four months. My doctor switched me from Zoloft to Cymbalta after I continued to experience panic attacks. Fortunately, Cymbalta worked great! My panic attacks went away and my mood swings seemed to calm down. But, about a month ago I decided that I wanted to come off of Cymbalta because my husband and I are trying to get pregnant. That&#039;s when things went down hill. Instead of tapering off of the medicine (which is not what my doctor said I would have to do) I just stopped cold turkey. I began to experience severe headaches, insomnia, nausea, tingling in my hands and face, I also began to hallucinate and the worst part has been the brain zaps.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m an 18yr old female, I used to weigh 115lbs and absolutely loved my body and and then over the past year  had some stressful things happen and I gained 35 pounds. Tomorrow will be one week since I started phentermine, I love it so far. I could count all of the food I&#039;ve eaten on one hand since I started and I used to go from eating out at least once a day sometimes up to three times a day and now I have no desire. If someone offered to take me to my favorite restaurant for free I would turn it down because I literally have no appetite. Only bad thing is without eating I feel a little dizzy and out of energy sometimes but it&#039;s so worth the energy boost in the morning and loss of appetite.""",3
Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have bpd, and it was a really rough start. My Dr had me on 27 different prescriptions in one year, and I was a total train wreck. Switched Dr&#039;s, and that one gave me a very high dose of benzos, and it almost killed me. Spent time in the icu for that one. Finally got the most amazing Dr now and he started me on gabapentin. It honestly saved my life.It is so hard to survive this illness when you cant get in under control. I had forgetten what it was like to be myself. I was angry and pissed off at everyone. It was so very hard on my husband and four little boys. I started with 300mg three times a day. The difference was amazing. I could smile and laugh. Thank you gabapentin for bringing me back!""",6
Monodox,Acne,"""I am 25 years old and I have always have had acne. I am one of the people that have tried everything under the sun; proactive, herbal, expensive top of the line products and acupuncture until I decided to speak to my wonderful dermatologist. He has prescribed me 100 Monodox twice a day along with Epiduo and it has worked wonders, no side effects. I&#039;ve been on this routine for about two and a half months. My skin has NEVER been clear until now. It has been since lately that the Monodox has caused my to be nauseous when I take it in the morning. Since I am not a big breakfast person I found that I must take it with a GOOD meal and the nausea has not come back. """,4
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I started taking Ambien CR 12.5mg for insomnia and it initially worked very well. Sometime around my 4th month on it I started to unknowingly wake and take at least one (or more???) during the night. One morning I awoke to find about half my bottle of pills spilled on the floor by my bed. Another time I awoke to find an empty drink glass beside my bed. Apparently I had got up and mixed a drink (maybe more than one???) . . . SCARY STUFF! No more Ambien for me, EVER.""",0
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been taking Tenuate for a few days. When I take it in the morning, I start to feel sweaty and shaky about 45 minutes later, but if I eat half a bowl of cereal and put my hair in a ponytail, then I am fine. The rest of the day when I take it, it does curb my appetite, but I still get hungry and I still like the taste of my favorite foods so I&#039;ll continue to eat after I&#039;m full. I hope to see a difference soon. Maybe its due to my hypoglycemia. I get really shaky anyway if I don&#039;t eat on time.""",2
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""After having my daughter in February of 2012, I got the nexaplon implant because we didn&#039;t want another child right off the bat.. I think I only had a period 3 times.. I had it removed June 25, 2015 because we wanted to try for another baby.. Since then, I&#039;ve had maybe 6 periods.. sounds great, right? No, not great at all. My periods have lasted 11 days, then 2 1/2 weeks, then 4 weeks, 5 weeks, etc. but they&#039;re every other month. They&#039;ve been very heavy periods, I go through 2 1/2 boxes (36 ct.) of super tampons, easily, during my periods. Then they slowly taper off, to leave me with spotting for 2 weeks. Currently, I&#039;ve been on my period for 3 weeks now. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""",8
Invega,Bipolar Disorde,"""I had tried Abilify, Fanapt, lithium, Depakote, and Geodon for my bipolar disorder. Luckily, a doctor introduced me to Invega. It helped dramatically with my bipolar issues and alcohol abuse. I have absolutely no problem with my mood since being on this medicine. I&#039;m always happy and am no longer irritable since being on this medicine. I don&#039;t have a problem with alcohol abuse anymore and I&#039;m able to drink like a normal person.  There are two problems I have with Invega though. The first is that I gained weight dramatically. In 5 months I gained 50 lbs. Also I would have random spurts of horrible anxiety.  Great medication all in all though.""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I first took Vyvanse about a year ago, was up to 50mg a day. I found it extremely helpful, but by late afternoon I was angry at everything and everyone. I decided to stop. I then tried a few other medicines (Strattera and Concerta). Strattera didn&#039;t really work as well as a stimulant and had very negative effects on my sex life, and Concerta didn&#039;t really work at all. I was ready to give up, but decided to give Vyvanse another try. This time I lowered the does to 30mg, and only took it during the work week. WOW - it made a huge difference. I&#039;m not seeing the same side effects that I did first time. So it is clear to me that I was over medicating. Anyways, just thought I would share.""",1
Oxycodone,Pain,"""OxyContin pain relief at 20 mg every 8 hours did not hold me through. Always had breakthrough pain, taking OxyIR 10 mg every four hours in addition. Decided just to take the OxyIR every four hours without the OxyContin and pretty much got same results. When taking both, the constipation problem was MAJOR. Then doctor prescribed Lactulose--worked better than others but had a choice: 50 percent of pain relief and walk around all day with an upset, growling, cramping stomach problems as a side effect of the Oxy&#039;s. """,9
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m 16 years old and I&#039;ve been struggling with cystic acne since I was 12. Strangely my pimples will mostly come out on my nose and sometimes on my cheeks. They always grew huge and fat. Believe me I tried every topical treatment I can think of and even tried organic ones too and none of them worked I then decided to go see a derm and got the pills and honestly I was afraid of it not working and just making my pimples even bigger and worse but it did not. It left my face almost completely acne free
I have not felt nauseous, my acne didn&#039;t get worse, surprisingly!!! The pills have not giving me any horrible side affects 
I believe the reason is because it&#039;s best to TAKE THE PILL WITH FOOD
It will lower the chances of getting side affects""",4
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""Lamictal has controlled my bipolar type 2 which manifests as depression &amp; hypomania. I never have full blown mania. My GYN Dr prescribed  hormone replacement treatment to treat my mood swings. It completely inactivated my Lamictal so it was as if I went off it cold turkey. It was the most horrible experience of my life!  My HR increased to 130, my BP to 160/98, my thoughts raced &amp; then I couldn&#039;t focus or make sense &amp; made serious mistakes. I didn&#039;t sleep &gt;15 hours in 5 days and no sleep the last 48 hrs. Klonopin saved me when 4 meds failed. Just don&#039;t ever drive!! I plan on using Uber!! Hope this helps someone! As w/all meds will need to adjust &amp; figure out how to taper off. I have an amazing Pdoc though &amp; I have strong faith. """,0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Its July 3, 2011 and I got the Mirena on February 25 2011. It did feel very uncomfortable when I got it but other than that I haven&#039;t had any issues. I&#039;m still waiting in my periods to lighten up or go away but unfortunately I STILL have them. Not complaining too much because that reassures me that I&#039;m not pregnant. I&#039;m less sexually active compared to before I had it but not because I&#039;m not in the mood its just because I have not had time. I do not feel the strings but I&#039;m going to go and get a pelvic ultrasound to make sure its still there.""",8
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I was on Loestrin for about a year and was always concerned about not having a period.  My husband and I tried just using condoms for a while, but after a few months I decided I needed to go back on some form of oral birth control.  My doctor suggested TriNessa, which has a higher dose of hormones, so I will have my period each month.  After only a month of that, I have noticed extreme anxiety and mood swings, random spotting, loss of libido, and nausea.  I know it takes a while to get into my system, but I&#039;ve already gained 10 pounds. Next month, I&#039;ll be switching back to Loestrin. I had no side effects and no weight gain when taking it, other than not having a period. After being assured by my doctor it is safe and normal. I&#039;ll go back to Loestrin.""",8
Lidocaine,Pain,"""I have 5 Bulging Discs in 3 different areas, Degenerate Disc through out the spine, &amp; Arthritis through out the spine.  I also have Fibromyalgia.  I also have shattered bones in my left hand &amp; left foot.

Thank U ever so kindly Kamneo""",9
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""So I first got the nexplanon in July of 2014, for the first 5 months I was fine, I didn&#039;t get my period and if I did it was random spotting (very light) but around January I noticed I was very emotional EVERYTHING made me cry. Then my period started coming twice a month with horrific cramps. Or I would spot for 2-3 weeks have a week where I thought It was over and started spotting again. I&#039;ve now had it for 13 months and it does the job because I havent gotten pregnant. But that&#039;s only because I haven&#039;t been able to have sex cause I don&#039;t know when my period is going to come""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I developed severe panic attacks. I felt like I was dying or going to pass out. Something was seriously wrong with me.  Logically I knew nothing was going to happen but then the panic came anyone I left the house. Shaking, sweating, disorentation, couldn&#039;t breathe etc etc. Starting lexapro was hard. I started at small dose of 5mg and had to adjust to it. Nothing more than I already felt. After about 2 weeks I started to not notice I was taking anything.  And then all the sudden I was at a store and I forgot to panic,  I felt fine.  I do have panic attacks still they are not gone but better.  There are situations I still can&#039;t handle but daily living,  going to work, school function,  dinner etc I can now do.""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I have inflammed acne and  I was on a different medication that made my skin super sensitive and extremely red, but took away the swelling of pimples but every time I would touch it it turned bright red so I switched to doxycycline  and after week 2  my skin has been pretty strong and less red! I&#039;m liking it better than the other one, I&#039;m on week 3 and I&#039;m seeing some improvement, hope it keeps going this way! I would definitely recommend it!""",4
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""If I could give it a 0, I would absolutely do so.  Started at 50mg, and felt WIRED.  Wanted to get up and clean the house!  Bumped it to 100mg, less wired, but still wide awake all night.  Bumped to 150, with the same lack of effect.  MD informed me after this dose it becomes less effective for sleep, so why even bother.  15 years of trying different sleep medications and alternatives, and this, I can say for sure, was the LEAST effective I have ever come across.  At it&#039;s low price point, feel free to give it a try, and maybe you will be luckier?  Everyone&#039;s sleep conditions are different.  But if you get hyper after benadryl, expect the same reaction to this drug.""",0
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Belviq for 60 days now and haven&#039;t had any success.I didn&#039;t need a weight loss pill until my doc prescribed me Zoloft and I gained 15 lbs in two months. I looked and felt extremely bloated after being on zoloft, so my doc prescribed Belviq.The first week I had horrible headaches but the cravings were still there.After the first 30 days,I called my doc about feeling bloated.She prescribed me a water pill.Meanwhile, I had NO weight loss on Belviq after the 30 days.After taking the water pill I lost 7 lbs of water weight.I went back to the doc,  and she said that I had lost 3lbs on Belviq and I needed to continue taking it.It&#039;s my 60th day on Belviq,I&#039;ve gained weight and still have cravings.Glad it worked for some people!""",3
Concerta,ADHD,"""My daughter has A.D.D. so we tried Concerta. At first it was fine I thought there was hope for my daughter but after two months my daughter started to get angry and really bad mood swings Super emotional.

MY daughter is very quiet and shy and keeps to her self, I am so happy I took her off of it. """,1
Morphine,Pain,"""I was prescribed name brand Oramorph SR for chronic back pain. I was taking 130mg 3X a day, I had bad nausea, severe edema. Most disturbing was the odor emitted from my skin, breath, and from bowel movements.

I would rate the pain relief &quot;so so&quot; and the side effects where not worth the pain relief obtained. Just look out for the swelling of the feet and legs.

I guess this medication was not the right one for me, as with most pain medicines we need to use trial and error to see which medicine will work best, in any given patient. 

Wishing you all a pain free day.""",9
Victoza,Obesity,"""I am a prediabetic with glucose at 109 fasting.  I am taking Victoza to lose weight and not become a full fledged diabetic.

I have lost 6 pounds, eat only when I need to, eat foods that are better for me and have NO NAUSEA at all. In 3 weeks I have already bumped up to 1.8mg a day.

I had it inserted Oct 2015 and have bled every day since (apart from 4 glorious days), never had acne before but I sure do now. I haven&#039;t gained weight, but that&#039;s because I haven&#039;t had an apatite at all and have had to force myself to eat most days. 

New symptoms cropped up as the months went on: nausea, fatigue, incapacitating back pain, breast pain, stomach cramps, headaches, dizziness, brain fog, irritability and general over-sensitivity.

But the worst part is how I seem to have become a depressed, raging lunatic. My thoughts and mood are just scary.

Diclofenac,Pain,"""I have upper neck pain and middle back pain from an auto accident.  By stretching the patch with help from my husband to put it on it stays put all 12 hours covering both spots of pain.  I work at a computer for most of my working days without the patch my neck is aching very badly by the end of the day, so putting it on before work prevents the pain at the end of the day.  My doctor advised me to use it as a preventative and it does do the job.""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got mirena put in two days ago and so far love it. I&#039;m twenty one with no kids and in a monogamous relationship. It does hurt to get in, a lot of cramping and pinching, but it only last for a few moments and is totally worth it in my book. I had it inserted towards the end of my period. Yesterday( the second day I had it) my bleeding stopped by the end of the day and I had no cramping. Today so far no spotting, although that wouldn&#039;t worry me, and ive also had no cramping or pain of any kind anywhere. So far I love it. My boyfriend and I had unprotected sex last night and it was wonderful not to have to think about taking  a pill or worrying if it was not effective yet. I would highly recommend so far. i will post again in about a month.""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got implanon on Christmas Eve 2012 and I&#039;m making an appointment to have it removed- it&#039;s now March 2014.  At first, I had periods for several weeks.

Bad parts?
I have easily gained about 5-10 lbs and I can&#039;t seem to shed them no matter what I do.  About 2-3 months after Implanon I developed seborrhoeic dermatitis around the crown of my hairline.  I&#039;ve tried everything and it will not go away (i.e.- cradle cap for adults basically). It&#039;s bad, like really bad. I&#039;ve read reviews/side effects and it&#039;s named as one.  Ugh.""",8

I&#039;ve been prescribed all the usual medicines: antibiotics, birth control pills, various topical creams and really, nothing has made any significant improvement. When I turned 40, 4 months ago I decided after doing extensive research, to ask my doctor about spironolactone. Since I&#039;m not looking to become pregnant, she thought we could give it a try. So I&#039;ve been on 50mg once a day for 4 months and this medicine has completely changed my life. My skin is not oily anymore and my cystic acne in my back is gone. My face is clear of acne. No side effects. But why didn&#039;t any dr/dermatologist prescribe this for me years ago?""",4
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I have had insomnia for over 20 years.  It had caused my overall health to decline, including chronic migraines, and depression. I have tried several medications but nothing worked.  Other medicines would either make me anxious, groggy during the day, or have no affect.  Finally, six years ago I was prescribed Klonopin.  It was a miracle, finally I felt rested and happy.  I was no longer tired, anxious or depressed.  It also helped with my migraines and seizures.   I know many people worry about staying on it long term, but to me the benefits out way any side effects (none found).  To me, I&#039;d rather take Klonopin the rest of my life, just like those who take aspirins daily for their heart, because it allows me to live a happy, productive life.""",0
Sertraline,Depression,"""I got put on this medication about 3 days ago and my first time taking it was in the morning. There are two side effects I&#039;ve had, the first day taking it I felt kinda nauseous and I threw up, but after that I was completely fine! I also have had a decreased appetite, but in my opinion that&#039;s a good thing, considering I want to lose a bit of weight. I was suffering for major depression, and got put on this medicine because I was caught in the middle of attempting suicide. But since I&#039;ve started this, I haven&#039;t had a single suicidal thought! I would definitely recommend this. Although ive been on it for just a few days, I already discover improvement.""",5
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been begging for years to take an anti anxiety medication. I was initially diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety. My neurologist increased my Effexor from 75mg to 150mg/day to treat the numbness and tingling in my feet due to diabetes. I became manic with my driving and spending habits. I was then re-diagnosed as being bipolar. I went years without anxiety medication and had several trips to the hospital with anxiety attacks that felt more like heart attacks. 
I was put on Buspar and took my first dose last night. This morning I couldn&#039;t find my wig. I ended up late to work in hopes of locating it. It&#039;s not where I left it and I wonder if I was sleep walking. Anyone experience anything similar?""",7
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had acne prone skin for as long as my memory allows and it never really seemed to be calm. This past year my scaring and acne seemed to be at its height. Recently, the doctor had prescribed Adapalene gel to me and I was automatically seeing the already on my face pimples disappear and my skin got softer. However, I am now on week 4 and half and my acne is getting to be awful all over again. I have not experienced skin sensitivity or peeling like my doctor said to expect, but its so much breakouts I feel like its worse than before. However, I do notice my scars are lightened tremendously, I just can&#039;t seem to patient enough to wait to see my pimples clear up.""",4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I love love love Adipex!

Weighing 210 pounds. Today is now Feb 19th not even a month later and I now weigh 185. That is 25 pounds down in just one month.  I work out (run a mile, ellipitical, 20 min abs) 5 to 6 days a week and I only eat 1000 to 1300 calories a day! This pill is amazing and everyone needs to try it, that is wanting to lose weight.""",3
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I have been using 3MG Silenor for a week now.  First thing I noticed were dreams have seemed more vivid.

I have thought that I stayed awake but the next time I looked at the clock it was 7:00 or later.  I am now getting 8 hours or even more sleep some days.  When I awake I want a cup of coffee right away.  As soon as I have it I feel good and that continues for the rest of the day.  I never took the other sleep medicines as I have a sleep maintenance problem only.   This is a great medicine and I would highly recommend it.  I am a 64 year old male who is in good health otherwise.""",0
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My seven year old son has been on Intuniv for three weeks now. His behavior at school and home is finally starting to improve. He is much more focused and less irritable. Although in the end of week one and beginning of week two of this medicine, he was very cranky and irritable. He is sleepy in the afternoons, but he also takes Clonidine along with this medicine, which also makes him sleepy. So I hope the sleepiness improves. He has started the last week having severe stomach pain. He gets up many times in the night saying his tummy feels funny and he gets some diarrhea in the night. He also has a harder time staying asleep at night, which is new. Hoping the stomach pain stops so we can continue the medicines, as I feel they are helping him.""",1
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I started Spironolactone for Acne in April and started out taking 50mg a day and I will say for the first three months I thought it wasn&#039;t working (I was still getting a lot of cystic acne breakouts around my chin and mouth). But I figured I would give it some more time because my body may still be adjusting to the other medications I&#039;m also using with it (derm also put me on orthotricyclen birth control to help with acne as well as Differin cream twice a week) I stuck it out and noticed a drastic change in the fourth month and I&#039;m now on month 5 and have had no breakouts for a month straight! I also lost about 8 pounds since I started on the medicine! Which was a great bonus. I recommend sticking it out!! It takes time but it really works!""",4
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I have never had the feeling of being full and have fought obesity since childhood. I had a successful gastric bypass in 1980 (but with serious lifelong medical complications) and lost 170lbs at after the operation.  Over the years I&#039;ve gained and lost up to 70lbs but never held a steady weight. I saw a psychiatrist 6 years ago (for other reasons) and shared this with him.  He told me about Topamax and explained that it did not work in everyone, but had with some of his patients with true food disorders.  He started me at 5mg/day  and increased the dosage by 5mg/ week.  When I reached 150mg/day I noticed that I consistently pushed my plate away or stopped eating when I was full. It has been a miracle, and my weight hasn&#039;t varied more than 5lbs in 7 years.""",2
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""I began taking this before I began any other medication. It made me more anxious and nervous. It also seemed to increase my OCD (the &quot;pure O&quot; form) by making me more prone to think about my OCD. It did help me to focus on occasions, but it also made me focus on my anxieties and obsessions as well. My therapist told me that stimulants like this one and Concerta are not good for people with anxiety disorders (almost all of them), unless they have anxiety because they cannot focus and accomplish necessary tasks. I recommend talking to a counselor or Psychologist/psychiatrist before being prescribed stimulants for ADHD.""",1
Tapentadol,Pain,"""Was taking 30 - 40 my hydrocodone, and 300 my tramadol  a day for lumbar for a min all stenosis, I have 4 herniated disks so to L2.  The hydrocodone was just scratching the surface of my pain.  My doctor put me on 100 my Nucynta ER X2 a day and it has been so mutch better.  Had to stop the tramadol.  Still taking the hydrocodone, need to adjust the dose but it has bee much better, almost no side affects.  They do only seem to last for 8 Jr so I will talk to my doc about doing 150 my x3 a day.""",9
Liletta,Birth Control,"""I got liletta placed in May 2016. I had it placed 7 weeks after I had my second child via csection. The insertion was uncomfortable but bearable for me. The first period I had was extremely long. It was about a month. After that I have had random spotting but not period. I haven&#039;t had any bad side effects and also no weight gain! I like liletta and if you can tough if out that first month of a wacky long period and little spotting I would definitely try it. It was also covered by my insurance 100% so that was also a plus for me.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Male, age 49. I&#039;ve climbed the ladder to a nice cushy office job with little or no walking. Regular days are 12-16 hours, leave when it&#039;s dark come home when it&#039;s dark. A co- worker introduced me to his doctor for a wellness visit, he prescribed phentrimine 30 mg and I&#039;ve lost 14lbs in 30 days. I honestly have very little time away from work and this loss in weight was simply smaller portions, lots of water and having enough self control to eliminate all high fructose corn syrups and eat lots off veggies, and no fast food. Enjoy and don&#039;t bow to temptation.""",3
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My 8 year old son was prescribed 2mg in the morning. He has  been on it for two weeks. At first it helped him concentrate in school but he was still aggressive with his sister and others. Week two, he now cries almost everyday at school and at home. He constantly talks about death. He keeps asking me if I will wait for him in heaven when I die. It is awful to see my innocent little boy go through this. I took him off of it right away. Vyvanse worked for him a lot better at the lowest dosage.""",1
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 17 years old and my mom works at an OB/GYN office and had me get Implanon.  The only negative part was it bruised for about a week and my stomach was a little upset the next day.  I have gained no weight or have had my mood effected or any other bad side effects.  My sex drive is just as high as it has been.  I love it because I have not gained weight, I have light spotting to no periods and it&#039;s stuck in my arm so I don&#039;t have to remember my birth control daily.""",8
L-methylfolate,Depression,"""I was so very excited when I found out that I could be helped after being diagnosed with MTHFR, I was on Deplin 15mg a day, I actually felt fantastic after about 2 months of treatment, after about 8 months I slowly started getting severe muscle pain and weakness also extreme joint pain as to where I could barely work or do the slightest of activities. Doctors ran a ton of blood tests but found nothing, I recently stopped taking Deplin and have found that the issues have disappeared! I loved Deplin and am very sad I can&#039;t take it any longer! It really also helps with depression and mood!""",5
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Today is May 15, I started at a low dose of 25mg cut in half. I do notice I&#039;m not having the fears. My child has a rare cancer with no treatment or cure, so I really thought of her death daily. I&#039;m able to not think negatively now which is healthier for both of us. I have no side effects that I&#039;m aware of yet. I am just starting out and on such a low dose. After reading all others here, I think I would like to stay on a lower dose, maybe less than 100mg. We will see. There is another part of me that just does not want any of this but the reality of it all is, I may feel this way now because the medicines are working. I have been on 100mg of Seroquel for 5 years for sleep. I am going to start to wean down and maybe off it, on Doctor&#039;s recommendation of course.""",6
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I have had on and off acne since I was a teenager, now 22, my acne became more hormonal on my cheeks.  I had tried everything, and decided to go to my doctor for a prescription. I was prescribed Stieva A 0.01%, and I am so happy!  I have only been on it for 7 days, but there has been a dramatic change already.  Over the first few days I had a breakout with the acne that had been under my skin, after they cleared up, I had a bit of drying (still do) but nothing too bad! I have also noticed that my skin feels a lot less oily, which I love! Will definitely continue, and can&#039;t wait to see results after a few months!
From what I have read online you are prone to breaking out at first, get through those first few days/weeks, results are worth it!""",4
Tegretol,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication is saving my life!  It really stabilizes my mood.  Before I started taking carbamazepine I would experience horribly crippling depression in the afternoons combined with very strong urges to self medicate with alcohol or narcotics.  Now I feel about the same all day, never really up and never really down.  I have no conflicts taking it with Suboxone. I have only noticed two side effects: nausea, taking it with food fixes that, and increased sleep.  I sleep longer than I did before and wake up feeling tired.  Actually it helps me to sleep through the night, which isn&#039;t all bad.  After I get up, take my other medicines, and have some coffee I am ready to face the day.  Note: I was previously misdiagnosed with major depression.""",6
Aczone,Acne,"""After I stopped taking my birth control pill I had experienced full blown severe acne. My body was used to taking it for 7 years so my hormones have been all out of whack. I wanted to cry everyday in the mirror looking at myself being 21 years old with a pizza face. Tried EVERYTHING and as soon as I was about to give up I was prescribed Aczone. After ONE DAY I began to see a difference. I&#039;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and am almost completely acne free. I SWEAR by this stuff it is the best thing that&#039;s ever happened to me regarding skin.""",4
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""Been taking Saxenda for 2 weeks and am on 1.8mg, going up to 2.4 today. Down 5 pounds! Goal is to lose 30 more. It has greatly reduced my appetite and any cravings. Few side effects: dehydrated, vomited once, nauseous here and there. I inject in the evening. Bought needles quite I expensively off Amazon. My insurance won&#039;t pay for it so I ordered it from a reputable Canadian pharmacy. I have hypothyroidism and am menopausal so losing wt is very hard. I have high hopes Saxenda will work for me!""",3
Onexton,Acne,"""I have been dealing with adult acne for years.  The product does work but I had to give it a little time.   It&#039;s been close to a month and my skin is almost clear.  I did have a few breakouts last week but were gone 2 days later.  I also experienced some dryness and peeling after washing my face with Proactiv and applying onexton right after.  The other thing I noticed was unbearable  stomach and leg cramps the first day of my period.  I usually get cramps but 1 Tylenol normally does the trick; not this time.  My cheeks are a little rosier than normal and my chin, which is where I apply most of the medicine, is turning a bit yellow (weird).  I think it&#039;s worth a shot but get in tune with your body in case there are any side effects""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""My son had severe acne. We tried every prescription and non-prescription topical cream and also the oral medications, minocycline and doxycycline. Nothing worked and he was struggling for 2 years with self esteem crushing acne all over his face. I was hesitant to have him try Accutane because of all the side effects but I&#039;m so glad we decided to have him try it. He started at 40 mg the first month and then switched to 80 mg for 5 months. His face is completely clear. I call this a miracle drug.   It&#039;s not for everyone and please realize there are some serious side effects for some people. My son mainly just had chapped lips and some peeling skin but nothing that wasn&#039;t manageable with moisturizer and chap stick""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""Unless you REALLY need this drug, I do not recommend it. That being said, if you are 80-100+lbs overweight, it is worth a try. It has cut my appetite/cravings for any food, not just junk. Female, 30, 5&#039;9&quot;, starting wt 260(ish). Started Contrave approx 6 weeks ago; have had nearly every side effect: nausea, constipation, headache, dizziness, trouble sleeping, dry mouth, bad taste in mouth, and tremors. I also got two of the less common ones: tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and menstrual irregularities. Most of the side effects DO go away. I still get migraines a couple times a week/a few times a wk before this. The constipation, trouble sleeping, and tinnitus remain. I am down 16lbs in 6 wks tho. Would 2-3lbs be more if I was less constipated""",2
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on Belviq since 10/17 and I lost 10 lbs so far.  I started on the sample from the doc.  My insurance, UHC, approved it right away.  It costs $25.  I am supposed to take two pills a day, but I only take 1.  Initially I had a headache for 2 or 3 days and I took Excedrin or Tylenol for relief.  Anyway, I don&#039;t have many side effects now.  I am really tired by the end of the day and I am usually asleep by 9 pm and I sleep like a baby.  I typically have sleep problems and have taken Ambien periodically.  I have no need for that now.  I think I would have lost more weight, but it took a minute to figure how to work out my eating plan.  I try not to eat carbs at night.  If I eat carbs, it will be once a day and I don&#039;t over indulge.""",3
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I took trazodone for a few months without any side affects that was cause a concern. Light grogginess in the morning is natural on any sleep aid. After a few months I got really dry mouth, headaches and the hangover was so intense that it would last all day long. After a few days at work with this dangerous hang over I stopped taking it. I&#039;d rather sleep just a few hours with natural stuff like melatonin then feel completely sick and exhausted at work the following day. I could see this working for someone who doesn&#039;t have a schedule. Not fun if you have to be up by a certain time.""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Started on 0.6mg Saxenda on May 8th weighing 342 lbs. After 7 days I upped the dosage to 0.9mg for 5 days then to 1.2mg. I have had no side affects from the medication aside from a very slight headache the first few days, could be unrelated since its allergy season right now. Today is May 23rd and I&#039;ve lost 15lbs. I am using this drug along with a low carb diet. My constant hunger was gone starting with the first injection. Is this how normal people feel? I don&#039;t wake up hungry, I don&#039;t go through my day always feeling hungry, I don&#039;t go to bed hungry. It&#039;s so liberating to be able to focus on other things instead of constantly being consumed by hunger.""",2
Elavil,Pain,"""I use Elavil for fibromyalgia...it has worked wonders for my sleep issues. My overall quality of life has dramatically increased simply because I am able to get the sleep I so needed and its helping with depression/anxiety. It works better than Ambien. My dose now is only 50 mg...so glad I tried this medicine. I am very scared of antidepressants due to a horrible reaction from Cymbalta but Elavil is an older medication and its chemical makeup is different than most of the newer SSRIs. I went from sleeping on average of 4 to 5 hours a night...now I can sleep 10 without ever waking up..literally something I haven&#039;t been able to do in 5 years. This medicine is the best medicine for me, and I&#039;ve tried everything out there as I have had Fibro for 8 years.""",9
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have  Bipolar Disorder, PTSD, Anxiety, OCD.  I Started taking 300 mg once at night, gradually went up to 1200 mg before my psychiatrist took me off of it. I&#039;ve taken other mood stabilizers as well as antidepressants and antipsychotics with none really having a noticeable effect. It helped to mellow me out some, but during and after stressful life changes and traumatic events that occurred, my anxiety, mania, paranoia, anger, irritability, brain fog, etc. was full blown. My depression and brain fog always lingered throughout the whole time I took it as well. I did not want to risk upping my dosage due to the possible toxicity. I was starting to feel extremely nauseous after taking it even though I always took it with plenty of food and drank plenty of water.""",6
Adderall,ADHD,"""I was a failing student, failing math 2 times. In my junior year of high school I took Adderall for the first time, on the first day of the school year. The first day of taking it was astonishing. I was very concentrated in math class, and that&#039;s not it, I had a desire to learn once I got into class. My grades improved to the high 90 percentiles, which I never thought I&#039;d accomplish. But there are side effects to taking Adderall. For me it&#039;s dizziness for about an hour in, headaches on occasion, and being very sleepy around afternoon. I urge parents who have kids with ADD/ADHD to let your kids try it out for a month. It might save their futures. You can skip doses as much as you like, so I don&#039;t take it on summer break or weekends.""",1
Kava,Anxiety,"""I have had serious issues with a-fib together with a heart rate of 150-170 for over 3 weeks. I have had a heart ablation surgery, and am now on 3 different blood pressure/heart regulation pills.  Lately, as soon as I lay down at night, my heart has begun to pound in my chest, so badly that I can&#039;t go to sleep.  If I finally do go to sleep, it is still doing the same dance when I wake up.  My chest burns &amp; I am exhausted for the rest of the day.  

BUT, at the suggestion of an old fashioned Mexican lady who is a dear friend of mine, I began steeping two tea bags of Kava in boiling water for 5 minutes and drinking that before bed time.  My blood pressure (which is usually around 135/85  immediately goes down to NORMAL (115/75).  I can sleep!""",7
Aczone,Acne,"""I&#039;m 29 years old. Starting at age 13 I started having skin issues that became cystic acne. At 21 I had enough and tried everything. Finally I gave Accutane a try. It completely cleared my skin for 7 years. At 28 after having 2 kids I began to get some small breakouts. Never as bad as it was but definitely noticeable. I tried Epiduo for about 6 months and I think it made it worse. My OBGYN put me on birth control and I was given Aczone. I was skeptical at first of another topical medication but I tried it. I&#039;ve been on it now in conjuction with birth control for 4 months and my skin is finally clear again. I&#039;m still on my first tube and probably only half way through it. A pea size amount, twice daily. I&#039;m very pleased with it!""",4
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""I have suffered with insomnia for years and no medications improved my condition until I started using Gabapentin. I have been taking it for 7 days and my quality of sleep has greatly improved. I used to wake up 3-4 times per night and found it hard to fall back asleep. Gabapentin puts me to sleep and I am enjoying deeper, more restful REM stages. I highly recommend it for this condition. I was prescribed this for chronic pain and this is a great bonus. Like the other reviewer it will cause residual grogginess the next day for several hours. Extra caffeine is definitely needed!""",0
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the Implanon inserted in August 2011. I like that I cannot get pregnant, my mood swings are just a little acting up and my eating habits are just the same. I&#039;ve gained just a little bit of weight, but nothing the gym can help with. The only irritating thing I have going on right is that I&#039;ve been bleeding since it was inserted. It&#039;s not heavy but light bleeding where it last for about a week. No cramping no crazy mood swings, like my doctor said everybody is different. You may bleed often or not bleed at all.""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had the Implanon since August 2007.  No pain when inserted.  I&#039;ve been having my periods twice a month for 7 days each time since I got it.  I&#039;ve gained 25 pounds and have hair loss.  I get headaches, and back aches around time for my monthly cycle. LIBIDO is gone, no desire to have sex.  Needless to say I am now single.  It&#039;s time for it to come out, but I&#039;m thinking about getting it again because the reviews I&#039;ve read for other birth controls have me scared!""",8
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I only took this medicine for 1 dose (25 mg) because it made my eyes fire red. So red that people were like what&#039;s wrong with your eyes! It took about 24 hours for it to go away. I had a pharmacist tell me not to take it then the doctor tell me to use Visine so I just didn&#039;t take anymore after reading the black box warnings. I didn&#039;t feel hungry like I usually do but I did feel pretty foggy.""",2
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I&#039;m 33 years old. I&#039;ve been on this medication for 6 years. My mood, temper and life in general are so much better. I went several years with depression that came on with postpartum. In a state of denial about my condition and not wanting to be labeled, I would not seek treatment. I wish I would have done so much sooner. I cannot say enough about Wellbutrin, it has changed my life. I deal with stress, death and everyday life of raising two teenagers now, which I firmly believe I could not have done without it. I have found you can be happy and would encourage people to get the mental help they need because medications like this one are life changing. I can also add side effects have not been an issue for me at all.""",5
Butrans,Pain,"""My pain management doctor put me on Butrans patches about 6 weeks ago 5 mg dose. The first box of four was a lifesaver. No more agony at work. Able to sleep. Did more in two weekends than I had in two years. I&#039;m hoping to bump up to the ten mg dose soon to cut down on my Norco. I have had chronic pain for many years and have been through many medicines including Oxycontin. This patch is the best so far.""",9
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""This medication saved my life! Better than any anti-depressant I&#039;ve ever tried (and I&#039;ve tried A LOT). Currently on it to help with my ADHD and Manic Depression (Bipolar 2)


Side effects are small and definitely worth it (to me, at least). Dry mouth and decrease in appetite.

Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed with  bipolar manic depressive , acute anxiety, depression, ocd , borderline personality, and post traumatic stress syndrome, when I was 21... postpartum depression triggered something, I was constantly agitated and angry, and sad,  .I would wake up angry, and cry allll day...my Dr prescribed me 20 mg zyprexa and I swear to you I was terrified,  that it would take 4 to 6 weeks to really work (I didn&#039;t have 4 to 6 weeks to wait , I felt...) I was nearly over the edge completely, constantly thinking suicide, I took my first dose of zyprexa and the very next morning I woke up wonderful!!! I still get upset , but not like before, this medicine was truly a miracle for me""",6
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Caused excessive weight gain (60+lbs) very quickly (despite me eating LESS), caused a weird decrease in cognitive ability, higher blood pressure (I already have hypertension, thanks), elevated blood sugar levels and probably other things I&#039;m forgetting... I&#039;ve been put on this against my will repeatedly because it&#039;s a Medicaid favored drug in my state, but it DOES NOT WORK FOR ME. I still have Medicaid but go to a private pay shrink because he listens.""",6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I have had severe side effects taking the Belsomra &amp; REFUSE to take anymore. I had Very ABNORMAL Dreams where I was fully awake and paralyized in bed. I tried to yell out for my husband and couldn&#039;t , I tried moving my arms to get out of bed and felt I was  being held back. One of the worst nights of my life. It had such a Demonic tone about it. I wrote my Doctor and and informed her that I will NOT be taking this medication any longer.""",0
Viibryd,Depression,"""I had dysthymia, low level but nagging depression after dealing with elderly parents, their health and emotional issues, resulting ultimately in moving them out of their home: father into nursing home and mother into assisted living. Watched as father died a slow natural death after years of health problems. Started Viibryd and on day four felt better. When titrating to 40mg felt bad physically in general, so have stayed on 20mg; been there for several weeks. I feel like the old me, not irritable and snappy, especially with my husband.  Feel more positive, confident and outgoing. I will be 57 in a few days. The bad: increased appetite especially for sweets and at night and 10  lb weight gain.

Implanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve only been on the implant since July and its September now and I still have my period...my mood swings are off the wall and worst of all my boobs and behind have both gotten smaller..the thing that worries me the most is I weigh the same but I feel so different. My emotions are controlling my life it seems. I don&#039;t know whether to tough it out because I&#039;m not pregnant and that&#039;s working well for me or figure something else out...I&#039;ve also had two experiences of chest/ arm/ back pain and random fevers...doctors don&#039;t help me....idk what to do. I think it&#039;s a good thing if you don&#039;t want kids right now but is it worth messing with your emotions and life..""",8
Bupropion,Depression,"""When first taking Wellbutrin, my mouth became really dry, I got a few weird headaches, and I felt some physical numbness when I touched my skin; However, after a month the symptoms were almost non-existent and my depression and anxiety improved drastically. Also, my doctor prescribed it to me to help with ADD/ADHD. I noticed that my focus was also better. This may be simply because anxiety can cause you to lack attention and it fixed the anxiety, but either way it worked great for me.""",5
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal has been a life saver. Started when I was 18, after 4 years of unsuccessful treatment plus 2-3 years of emotional instability not treated. Started lamictal and I finally felt like &quot;the person I was always supposed to grow up to be&quot;. I do get the &quot;morning woozies&quot; when I increase the dose for worsening symptoms, but I have been more or less in remission. Very minimal side effects, and generally effective as stand alone maintenance drug.""",6
Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Tegretol for 15 years and it definitely controls the hypomania and rapid cycling, though not the depression so well.  It sort of leaves you feeling flat, but I had tried lithium, Depakote, and a few of the atypical antipsychotics and they were too heavy duty or left me with extreme weight gain.  When I went on Tegretol I have 50 pounds of extra weight from Depakote....it came off within 4 months.  I am not thin now, as I have gotten older, but I suppose it is still the drug for me.  At this stage of the game I don&#039;t feel like trying other meds as I have to work and function.  I also take a small dose of Lamictal too.""",6
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I took Lexapro for 5-6 years started with 10 mg then eventually increased to 30 mg. It worked great for helping me keep calm, and helped my depression and was able to deal with stress, however the more I had to increase the dose the more tired I got, and I eventually got to a point I just could not function, it took everything I had just to get out of bed then maybe 2 hrs later I was ready for a 3-4 hour nap. My doctor then switched me back to 10mg and added Wellbutrin that worked good together but when I had to increase the dose of Lexapro I got to where I couldn&#039;t function again. Lexapro is a good medication at a low dose.""",5
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I absolutely hates this drug and do not recommend it to ANYONE. Not only did I not lose any weight while on it, despite eating less, eating healthier, and exercising more, it seriously affected my mental health. It messed with my mind so much, by week 4 I was feeling really bad. And of course you can&#039;t just quit, you have to wean off. I had to have a whole additional anti-anxiety med added to combat the side effects and it still wasn&#039;t enough. Once I finally got off I was so much better mentally. I&#039;d rather be overweight than ever go through that experience again.""",3
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on lithium for a month and a half and the only side effects I have is headaches. It is easily managed when keeping up on my water intake. This medicine has been a great for my bipolar 2 disorder. I haven&#039;t felt this calm in a very long time. My anxiety is at an all time low as well. My moods aren&#039;t all over the place either. I&#039;m so thankful I gave this medicine a chance. It has changed my life in the best way.""",6
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed 25mg of escitalopram for my anxiety at work/social anxiety. I had tried before Amitriptyline which is an older medicine for this but it made me really sleepy, literally it would knock me down for 12 hours which was very disruptive.

I started a new job which was demanding and escitalopram kept me calmed and still I was able to think clearly. The problem with it is that as the previous medicine it made me sleepy (I&#039;d come home after work and I&#039;d be exhausted, just wanted to lie in bed and read). Also I gained lots of weight, it made me less active (stopped gym) and made me crave carbohydrates which caused this. It did work though. My doctor has switched me to Zoloft, when I have more info I&#039;ll write on that""",7
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Female 40yrs old, 5&#039;3&quot;. I&#039;ve started phentermine 37.5mg Friday July 8, 2016. Starting weight 200.4.  Today July 10, 2016, I am down to 196.4.

I find to get a headache mid afternoon 2-3pm. I take it at 830am. Take Excedrin, and all is well. I&#039;d like to get to 170 first goal, 160 2nd goal, and then finally 150. So far those are the only side effects I&#039;m experiencing. I&#039;m not counting calories, but am watching what I eat and drink only water, and exercise hr 3 days week, plus daily housework. I also have a kitten that&#039;s very hyper and keeps me active. LoL. Good luck to everyone&#039;s weight loss!""",2
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I regret, in hindsight, trying this method of birth control. I had been on the microgestin pill for about 5 years prior to trying this - microgestin had worked really well and helped clear my body and face acne significantly.
I had the nexplanon in a total of 8 months (at age 21) - the first 2-3 months were fine probably because my body was still adapting to the change in hormones. After about 3 months it all went downhill. After that 3 month mark hit I began having nonstop bleeding, I became moody and depressed most of the time, my anxiety got worse, and my acne began coming back as it had when I was a teenager before the pill. 
Since taking it out, my acne is clearing and my mood is better. I am so happy to be done with it.""",8
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve read so many negative comments on here and side effects that sound miserable. And I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t let that stop me from trying this med. I have lost 8 pounds in two weeks. I&#039;m eating like a normal human and have zero desire to binge which is miraculous. If  I get hungry I eat. Then I&#039;m over it. I had 1.5 pieces of pizza just now which is unheard of I would have eaten the whole thing or at least 4 pieces before! I&#039;m not nauseous because I do my injections at night. I have no headaches etc. The only side effect I&#039;ve had is a bit of constipation but strange as this sounds, it&#039;s a welcome change. I usually have chronic diarrhea. All I&#039;m saying is give it a chance.""",2
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I am 32 years old and have struggled with acne since high school.  I was completely freaked out about taking this medication after reading all the horror stories online, but after talking to my doctor I knew I wanted to give it a try.  I am in my 2nd month of taking the medication and I have seen dramatic results.  I have not had any bad side effects so far.  Have had dry lips (too be expected) but they have not been bad at all (Thanks to Aquaphor Lip Repair - I constantly put it on).  My skin is dry, which is also to be expected.  I wear contacts and my eyes do get dry at times, but no drops help.  I do notice joint aches at times so I take Tylenol or Advil and it helps.  It&#039;s nothing severe at all.  BEST MEDICATION EVER.""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Not worth it! There are other methods to clear up the infection. Try an antibiotic first. I have had to be on antibiotics for years now to keep the cystic acne manageable. I tried accutane and I regret taking it for the six days that I did. May have issues forever. Now I&#039;m back on a normal antibiotic with zero side effects. Also, I started using a home made scrub my sister in law made me. :) hope this helps.""",4
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""Honestly, it is a pretty effective birth control but it does have some nasty side effects. I&#039;ve been using it for over 6 months and have had no pregnancy scares. After reading reviews I asked my husband if thought I have been depressed since I started taking it and he said yes without hesitation. So that is definitely a downside to the Nuvaring. The biggest issue for me is that I&#039;ve probably gained 40 lbs since I started and I&#039;ve been the same weight for years. I have stretch marks all over my body. It is so awful. I knew weight gain was possible but this has been the worst side effect for me. As nice as it is to not have to think about birth control more than once a month, I am going to stop. I don&#039;t want to keep gaining weight like this""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Got the Nexplanon 10/6/16 . I got on it to prevent pregnancy and so far I haven&#039;t got pregnant. When I first got on it I didn&#039;t bleed for one week. Now most days just a really heavy flow other days golf ball size clots. Recently just started to be both clots and a very heavy flow. Mood swings are bad some times I get really bad cramps where I can&#039;t feel from my uterus down &amp; headache are unbearable
I been just sucking it up until I have to get the Nexplanon taken out (10/6/2019)""",8
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""Dissolves very quickly compared to other sub-lingual tablets that I have taken - tastes horrible though! I have experienced no negative side effects, and it has definitely elevated my mood and taken away the &quot;shadows&quot; and some of the &quot;noises&quot; that accompany my diagnosis....overall seems to be much better than the last two meds I was prescribed (Lamictal and Abilify). I give it a ten!""",6
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""This medicine has saved my life on several occasions.  I developed physical anxiety issues (severe tingling, losing balance, trouble driving, insomnia, etc) a year after my 3rd child was born.  My physician tried several SSRI and tricyclic antidepressants.  They all made my symptoms worse.  Ativan/Lorazepam helped immediately for all symptoms.  In my opinion it is a miracle and I hate how it is demonized in the media and medical community.  When you suffer a month without sleeping hardly at all and can barely function in a normal setting due to crippling physical anxiety symptoms, and something provides relief, you take it.  Yes, when you are ready to stop the medicine you have to reduce very slowly over a long period of time.  Godsend!""",7
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I suffer manor depression anxiety and insomnia.
I was on trazadone 100mg, which I cut back to 50mg because it&#039;s very sedating.
I switched from trazadone 50mg to amitriptyline 10mg to start 2 days ago.
It is not as strong as the trazadone but does the same job, although I may need a higher dose eventually.
I don&#039;t wake up as groggy as with other meds and sleep well.
So far so good not many side effects but some dry mouth. But I am also switching from cipralex to Effexor so it&#039;s hard to tell which side effect is coming from which med.
But I do think this med is helping for sleep and anxiety. Btw I was addicted to benzodiazepines for years so this is a good substitute for addictive meds.""",0
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I wanted to post because I was so afraid from the negative reviews I read before getting Nexplanon. With that being said, I highly recommend this product. The last time I posted I stated that I was bleeding for about 9 days. The light spotting lasted for about 3 weeks. Then nothing for 3 weeks, and it started again for about 2 weeks. Since then (2 months) I have not had any sporting. Besides the trials in the beginning, I am very pleased with this product. No mood swings, no acne, no low sex drive and no periods!""",8
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I was on the Mirena for 4 months, and I received it after having my first child. At first, it was amazing. Insertion did not hurt me what so ever. I did take medicine afterwards, but the day after I felt back to normal. Now, a few months later, all the side effects are popping up. I felt alone, depressed, and suicidal. I felt like I was drowning. I have constant headaches, a weight gain of 20 pounds in FOUR months. I thought this was all just due to my new postpartum life, but after reading others saying they gained weight I decided to get it out. Sex is incredibly painful for me and feels like I&#039;m being stabbed. Periods lasting 2 weeks, then off 2 weeks, then again. This drug is terrible, although I really wish it had worked for me.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I began Contrave in Sept 2015. I lost about 40 lbs by January, mostly due to nausea at first, but then because it helped me really consider if I needed more whenever I ate. I was able to keep this weight off for about a year. At that point I began to slowly see a creep back up on the scale. After 20 lbs returning and I was taking the max dose, I determined that the side effects- eye focus problems and constipation- were no longer worth it. I stopped taking the pills and it took about 6 weeks before I felt like me again. It has been about 8 months and I am at my pre-Contrave weight again- such a defeat. About 2 weeks ago, I decided to try again. I took 1 pill at night for the first 2 weeks and the nausea is there, but not as bad as before.""",2
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Qsymia since late September 2016. So far I have lost 26 lbs. This medication has helped cut my cravings. Nothing I have tried in the past has worked this well. It&#039;s not without side effects. Some dizziness upon first starting and increased heart rate. I may need to talk with my MD about increasing my dose. I continue to loose weight but my appetite is a little heavier than its been. By far I recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting healthier and dropping some serious weight.""",3
Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m very treatment resistant bipolar type 2, typically severely depressed, with OCD and several other comorbid diagnoses, and antidepressants for me, IF they work, will tend to poop out after only a few weeks to a few months. This was not the case for duloxetine. I started on 60 mg and it worked wonderfully for several months, the longest any antidepressant has worked for me. Then, that summer, I became depressed again. After trials of other meds, I wound up back on duloxetine, this time at 90 mg, which worked for another 6 months. I begged for 120 mg but for some reason my psychiatrist refused to prescribe it, so I had to switch to something else. Recently I wound up back on it for about a month or so at 120 mg, then at 80 mg.""",6
Celexa,Depression,"""I started taking Celexa about five months ago and let me tell you, my life is finally normal. I had been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was 13 and it got significantly worse over the course of five years until I was crying and enraged over anything and everything. I could not think straight. Even when I knew I was getting mad over something small, I could not control my anger. I am currently taking 20 mg of Celexa and experiencing no side effects. I am completely back to normal on this medicine. I can think straight and I am happy!""",5
Implanon,Birth Control,"""First couple of months I had a longer then usual period. After about 2 months in it completely stopped although I had light craps and mood swings through out the first couple of months no weight gain. Perks of having the implant, not having to worry about missed pills (although I was never good at taking pill form birth control) No shot and yet still having periods ! All around the implants been good to me. Would highly recommend it to anyone with an irregular period!!!   Haha good luck ladies!""",8
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""10 days on Lunesta (generic).  Not sure why doc suggested I try it, as I&#039;d been on same low dose of ambien for 3 years, good results.  Anyway, had the metallic taste, just annoying but I slept so ok.  After a day or so waking up more, sleeping less. Took an extra 1/2 last night -total 4.5 mg.  slept, but today all day major headaches and nausea. Not sure what to do tonight-wishing for backup benedryl.  Calling doc tomorrow-will request back to ambien.""",0
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been taking Latuda for over a year now for bipolar 2.  It seemed to work well for a few months at 40mg, then stopped working.  Upped dose to 60, worked for a few months.  Increased again to 80, now ineffective.  Now I&#039;m on lamotrigine concurrently - if that helps I will stop taking Latuda.
Side effects have been very bad.  Never had a panic attack in my life until I took Latuda, now I&#039;ve had several.  Nausea every time I take it.  Supposedly this medicine is &quot;weight-neutral&quot;, but I gained at least 30 pounds over the past year and a half (I didn&#039;t change my diet or exercise habits from before taking it).  Now I am eating better and working out, but I doubt if I can lose the weight until I&#039;m off Latuda.  Hope to get off it soon!""",6
Bupropion,Depression,"""Dude... OK... I&#039;ve only been taking this a few days and my Dr is starting me on a low dose of 150mg... But I just needed to say something about how I feel.
I struggle with depression and ADD... I struggle with impulsive masochistic behavior when going through a tough time... Like binge eating etc.
Today....... I felt calm. Pleasantly neutral happy and calm... A little foggy headed, tired and quiet and *tiny* headache... But it was amazing to not feel the intense emotions. I had some coffee and then I really got some housework done for the first time in weeks.
I hope that this helps me lose weight... Not just by curbing appetite but because I&#039;ll be less prone to the emotions that drive me to binge. I&#039;m HOPEFUL. We&#039;ll see how it goes!""",5
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed this for Anxiety never should have had such strong medication for that as it controls seizures and brain injurys. My physical health&amp; nerves were fine before this. Nuerontin destroyed the nerves in my hands&amp; feet&amp; gave me Peripheral&amp; Axonal Neuropathy. Ironically its used to treat these nerve conditions but because my nerves were fine before taking it,It did the opposite and destroyed the nerves in my hands&amp; feet destroying my life. Have been disabled 8 yrs for trusting my Dr and the damage is irreversable. Drs shouldn&#039;t use patientz as guinea pigs and pharmaceutical companies should not  e allowed to give medication not intended for medical conditions.I have lost 8 yrs of my life due to this medication and am not diabetic.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""After I had my son, 6 weeks later I got the implant. I thought it was a great idea. (I have always been fit and was able to lose weight with no problem). After the implant, I bled for 3 months STRAIGHT. Doctor said this was normal. It eventually died down. During those 3 months I also gained 30 pounds! I would work out 6 days a week, health diet. I have lost nothing. I bleed for months at a time. Horrible cramps and headaches. So moody. And tired. I&#039;m not pregnant though. 
Needless to say, the implant will be removed in a few days after having it for 2 years. 
Use at your own risk. Works for some, but not all. Good luck. Hope this helps.""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Implanon in October 2011 while on my period. At the end of that cycle I did not get my period again until October 2012. It was the best year ever! No mood swings, not worrying about a pill, my weight stayed the same, and my sex drive increased. I&#039;m also a huge whimp about needles but insertion didn&#039;t hurt. However, from Oct 2012- present (Jan 2013) I&#039;ve gotten my period erratically from every other week to every 2 weeks. I&#039;m going on vacation soon and the unpredictability of the medicine is starting to seriously irritate me (and put a damper on my daily routine). I hate to give it up because the first year spoiled me so much! But I&#039;m afraid the aggravation of the unknown may have me removing it in the very near future..""",8
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I was started on Pristiq 50mg a year ago when my moods started to get out of control, as well as my anger. I was so angry all the time, and I felt like I was always on the verge of crying. I experienced no side effects whatsoever from the Pristiq, and felt a noticable difference within a week. I&#039;m not angry for no reason any more, and I don&#039;t feel like I have to cry when I drop a spoon. This medication worked wonders for my depression, anxiety, anger and invasive thoughts. My doctor increased the dose to 100mg after I plummeted emotionally, despite the Pristiq. The increased dosage worked! I&#039;ve been on 100mg for 6 months with no side effects and no complaints.""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have recently begun taking Contrave.  I am looking to loose 10 to 15 pounds.  It&#039;s not much to loose but to maintain it is the problem.  I&#039;ve probably lost the same 10 lbs, over and over again.  My Dr. said that&#039;s the beauty of contrave, it helps in maintenance.  Day 3 into the program (1pill in the AM) I have begun to notice a decrease in the desire to eat. I tend to eat when I&#039;m bored and that&#039;s my issue.  I have none of the side effects which so many mention. I will stick to my daily exercise, lots of water and healthy eating and hopefully begin seeing more positive results by the end of the week.""",2
Doxepin,Depression,"""It works tremendously well on Insomnia and really does help on maintaining a normalcy in everyday life. Sleeping a lot at first, which in my case was a good thing. It&#039;s not the best for uplifting depression and doesn&#039;t help in taking away anxiety or panic attacks. The side affects for me was being easily bothered &amp; hostal/angry. Will pass if you continue taking as directed,but each time you stop n then start again the experience starts over. But keep in mind,side affects vary and its different for each  of Us. What works for one might not work for another. I&#039;ve been taking Sinequan/Doxepin for over two decades.""",5
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""The most reliable and consistent ADHD CNS I&#039;ve ever taken! Their new instant release tablets they came out with recently, are really great. Instead of taking the usual four salts (Adderall), you have one (Dextroamphetamine Sulfate). My grades and focus went up about 30 percent after taking these on right dose. I&#039;ve been stuggling with ADHD since I was 6 yro. Also, I take 30mg x 3 per day. I always joke with friends that dexy makes me feel sexy.""",1
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Just start on 5 Oct at 278lb - been tracking food and exercise in fitnesspal. Minor side effects that pass quickly. I asked doctor for this as it contains buprion which I was on nearly 16 years ago. I lost weight while on that and was able to maintain for some time. Due to lifestyle changes, stress, bad foot and age (51 now) I gained a lot of weight in the past 10 years and have been trying so many different ways to get control back but was not having success. Since being on contrave I feel more focused don&#039;t need to snack between meals and am already down to 272.5lb. I really hope I have the success some other have had - good luck to everyone whose fighting to control their weight it&#039;s hard for some of us but not impossible""",3
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for under three weeks now and it&#039;s been pretty great so far. I suffer from severe general and social anxiety and also depression. 
I started on 10mg for the first four days, then upped to 20mg on the fifth day. 

I noticed slight results after day four and to this day the over thinking and gut wrenching anxiety has been lessened. I have no depression anymore and it&#039;s close to impossible to care about stressful situations.

I&#039;m well aware it can take up to two months for Lexapro to fully take effect, however I feel the positive benefits already.
Definitely something worth a try! Especially if you have anxiety and depression that is out of control. 

Besides the side effects, which are slowly fading away, Lexapro is great""",7
Strattera,ADHD,"""I was a happy but chaotic woman with ADHD. I am looking for a substitute for Ritalin because although it worked miracles for my lack of attention an organizing skills it eventually wore me out. My new neurologist suggested Strattera (80 mg/day ). At first it made me very tired. After a few weeks Strattera changed me into an emotional wreck. Crying every minute for no reason. I&#039;m still in hospital. I&#039;m so tired of trying something new and hoping it will make the fog in my head disappear. But we&#039;re back to square one. No more Strattera fore me...""",1
Toradol,Pain,"""I first started taking Toradol when I was in the E.R. for severe back pain back in 1992. In recent years my pain has gotten worse so I was put on it again. I do not take more than about one a month due to its side effects, none of which I have experienced. The doctor only gives me ten to last me at least ten months. All I know is without it I couldn&#039;t handle the pain. After about an hour it starts to work and I feel a lot better. I only take it when the pain is at its worse and I have trouble standing or walking. Just wish I could take it everyday.""",9
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I started dieting on my own in late June of 2012.  When I started I weighed about 337lbs.  On my own using Visalia shakes I lost about 20lbs.

Adipex is great for giving you an advantage and I am really happy with it, but I have made and continue to make better food choices.  I cut out all sodas, even diet.  I try to eat healthy small meals.  I still eat carbs, but I try to limit them.  Eventually I plan on eliminating sugar as well.  I am never going back to where I was and I plan on exercising and pushing myself for at least another 100-120lbs!""",2
Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorde,"""I gained 10 lbs in under 1 week, which sets a speed record among the weight-gain meds I&#039;ve taken.  Since that pushed me up to the pre-diabetic border, my psychiatrist pulled me off of it ASAP - not to mention that when you&#039;re severely depressed, how is super chunking up supposed to make you feel better no matter how well the med works?  1 month &amp; I would have been up 40 lbs!  I felt no other side effects, nor any positive effects, but 1 week probably wasn&#039;t long enough for it to make a difference on my mood - only my rear end.""",6
Selegiline,Depression,"""Emsam transdermal has given me back my life! From a depression so severe that I was non-functional, I am now back to the person who loves life and living. My doctor tried every ssri you can imagine with my condition only worsening. The only adverse side effects seem to be skin irritation and constipation.

Effexor XR,Depression,"""primary care doctor started me on effexor xr 75, increased to 150 after 1 month. I was still very depressed and went to a psychitrist, crying at the first visit. she said it was melancholic and immediately doubled the dose to 300/day. It worked very well at the high dose, which I took for 4 years. it was more effective and continued to be the whole 4 years. best of all i had tried (paxil, celexa, lexapro, wellbutrin). i seemed to be in remission, we began tapering down. went to 150 for 1 month, then 75 for 1 month then stopped.  i got the foggy feeling and &quot;brain zaps&quot; but a temporary increase in my klonopin dose for a week and i felt fine. i should mention i went through alcohol and opiate withdrawal before, so this seemed not that bad.""",5
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Side effects, a bit of fatigue passed after four days. Weight loss 30lbs. 24 pounds in three months. Combination with low carb diet and simple slow cardio walking. Weight  loss doc as my regular doc does not believe in weight loss medicine. Steady, level headed weight loss and better blood labs for me. Not a doctor but this is right up my alley. Money well spent for my good health no insurance coverage yet.""",3
Bupropion,Depression,"""I felt very little positive effect when I was on 150 SR  for two months. After I switched to XL 300 I noticed a change. I have been taking this for about two months. All I can say is HANG IN THERE! For me the side effects were awful and it took so long to start feeling better. But now I do! I feel like myself again--I don&#039;t feel blissfully happy and I still get down at times but I feel like a normal human being. This quite literally saved my life.""",5
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have severe IC. This is the only Med that my Urologist will prescribe for my 9/10 pain. I take 50mg 3x/day. It does lower pain level to a 1/2. However I get headaches and just a bit &quot;foggy&quot;.
All things considered though I cannot function with the pain so I have to tolerate these side effects in order to live a &quot;normal&quot; life.
Norco did work better but my MD will no longer prescribe that due to addiction possibilities.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Started this medicine 6 weeks ago and have lost 10 lbs. I have been watching my diet and walk/jog 2.5 miles 5 days a week with other exercises. I have a hypothyroidism making it very difficult to lose weight. Was on this medicine one other time 1.5 years ago for a month straight and realized that my body is immune to it after one week.  Now I take it 1 week on, 1 week off.  I notice lots of energy and dry mouth and a happy feeling for the first 4 days and then I start feeling sad, which then goes away in about 4 more days. I have also noticed vision changes in my right eye which I plan to see my eye doctor about.  All in all I recommend Phentermine as I would never have lost the weight or had the energy to make the necessary changes.""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I have tried everything I could to lose weight from pills, to shakes, to teas, to detoxing, to even a lap band, and NONE of it worked. I had hit my all-time high of 230. I went to my fertility doctor and she said I was in bad health to try to have a baby. My cholesterol was high, my blood pressure was high, and to make it worse, I was pre-diabetic. I&#039;ve been on adipex now for a month and a half. I&#039;ve lost 35 lbs, barely exercise, but I&#039;m so full of energy that I&#039;ve completely redone my house, cleaned the garage, and refurbished lots of furniture pieces. I LOVE IT!!!

NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I love the NuvaRing. I started on after my son was born 6 years ago. Its easy to use, gentle to put in and remove, doesn&#039;t move at all while in there, and I never ever feel it during sex. After I started using it for about 3 years straight, I came off for 2 years as my Fiance was out of the country. I just started back June 2013, and love it even the more now. It doesn&#039;t decrease my sex drive, and although I am newly married, I have to admit my sexual desire has increased. With every birth control there are bouts of Sadness and anxiousness, but you distract yourself by watching great movies and eating popcorn, not tons of goodies which probably increases weight gain. I have never attributed weight gain the the Nuva Ring, but my own diet.""",8
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I had seen a story about Qsymia on the news right before seeing my doctor for the results of my physical. I was at the highest weight I had ever been 233 lbs, 43 years old and a mostly inactive lifestyle. I did some research on side effects, printed out all the information I could find and took it with me to my appointment. My doctor was hesitant because she never heard of Qsymia, but agreed to a trial 6 month run that was in July. Today I had my fifth doctor&#039;s appointment, 40 pounds lost, current weight 193, she has approved me to be on Qsymia until the goal weight is reached since she has done research and found that it okay to be on it for the long term. No dieting! Barely exercising. Appetite is decreased - HUGE SUCCESS.""",2
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I&#039;m a 19 year old girl and I&#039;ve been suffering from major depression and social anxiety for the past 5 years.

I had side effects the first day I took it - nausea, slight headache, slight dizziness, sleepy and yawning a lot and most annoyingly INSOMNIA! I even felt a little confused at bedtime while trying to sleep. The side effects lasted for the first 3 days, now they&#039;re slowly going away. The first day I was really hyper and the next I was so tired but now it&#039;s starting to balance out and I can sleep better.

Initially I had a small break out but these pimples already seem to be healing. The only side effect I have experienced is feeling like throwing up

Meperidine,Pain,"""I was being treated in the ER for a bad gallbladder, and Pancreatitis. First they tried Morphine. It made me drunk but didn&#039;t touch the pain. Next she shot a big load of Demerol into my I.V. In ten seconds all my pain was gone! I only gave the Demerol an 8 because within 24 hours it stopped working for me. My Doctor then put me on Dilaudid. That fixed me good! I was on it for three days with some other I.V. Medicines to kick it in. He then took the gallbladder out and sent me home with two weeks worth of Dilaudid for pain. All these drugs are great but be careful.""",9
Concerta,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 17 and have been taking this for about a month now for ADHD. I started at small doses of Ritalin (10 mg) and then moved to 20 mg. My doctor thought it would be easier to just put me on Concerta since it&#039;s 18 mg a pill. I then took 36 mg of Concerta which didn&#039;t work out. I got major irritability and started feeling depressed. Even my focus was off. I went back down to 18 mg and it&#039;s working much better. No irritability, depression feeling. Make sure you&#039;re on the right dose for your body, too much can do more harm and too little may not do any thing.""",1
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medicine has helped about 95% with my depression and about 75% with my moods I have been on it for about 3 months now I go through periods where I am so happy and so in love with my husband very high libido (feelings I have always struggled to have) But there has been about 2 weeks during this 3 months that I go back to being irritable and moody and wanna smack my husband for everything that comes out of his mouth. So being on these medicine and being Bipolar maybe I&#039;ll never be 100% normal.""",6
Demerol,Pain,"""As Percocet was not helping my back pain anymore my Doctor switched me to Demerol 100mg. Now my back pain is once again under control and I am only taking two pills a day instead of 6-8 Percocets. I have had no negative side effects as of yet. This is by far the most relief I&#039;ve had in years. I&#039;ve been on Vicodin, Percocet, MS Contin, naproxen, Norco 10mg and I&#039;ve never had total relief until now. """,9
Solodyn,Acne,"""I have had on and off acne for about 8 years. During August-October 2015 my skin was breaking out into big painful cystic pimples. They were mostly on my chin but some on my forehead as well. I was prescribed Solodyn 80mg in October and by January I had absolutely no pimples on my face. It gave me some side effects such as headaches and light dizziness. I also felt slight nauseous, but nothing too serious. It really cleared up my skin. This is the first oral product that has cleared my skin up in 8 years and I have tried pills such as dococyline (did not work). I swear by this pill. I stopped taking it in February because my skin was great. But now I am going on them in generic form because my acne began to come back in April.""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I used Accutane for 3 months and my skin was flawless. Literally one of the best decisions of my life. My doctor told me not to drink but it was my senior year of high school so I still drank a lot on it. I seemed to get drunk quicker. I hope my liver is okay! My skin cleared up then it came back when I got to college, whenever I was stressed I would breakout, but whatever it&#039;s still better than it used to be.""",4
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Couldn&#039;t sleep. Dr prescribed 50mg and 10 minutes after taking this medicine I felt extreme anxiety and felt panic .  Heart racing.  Looked it up immediately and saw it was a side effect with some people. But  it is not scarier than not sleeping.  Will tell Dr next time I go in what happened. Now just up when I can&#039;t sleep and hoping there is something that will help. I tried ambien which worked for a while but had an episode of sleep walking on it. I don&#039;t know what else there is to try.  Did all the natural otc stuff and exercised more but I still wake up in the middle of the night and can&#039;t fall asleep again. Healthy 54 year old woman, 110lbs 5&#039;4.  Widowed  started happening after my husband passed away tried antidepressants too""",0
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I have been on mirtazapine for just over a month, like others here I had trouble sleeping only a few hours a night, this became unbearable and I couldn&#039;t function in my work or daily life, I was tearful and miserable. I went to my doc explained the situation, I didn&#039;t want antidepressants as tried them before with dreadful side effects. Long story short I relented and thought I&#039;d try mirtazapine for a week, I&#039;m now into my 5th week and sleep well most nights, a few night sweats and some weird dreams but I&#039;m starting to feel human again.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m the same user from 3/18 post, I started on 1/7/11 at 332.6lbs. I took 30mg for 60 days. I got another script for 60 days from my doctor. I changed all my eating habits from the first day and started to exercise. I decided to take a break for 10 days to get it out of my system before starting the new script. I noticed no side effects of stopping. I stuck with the diet and upped the exercise just a little. I still lost 3lbs that week! The week before, still on pills, I only lost 1.8lbs. I decided to stop taking it all together. I&#039;m down to 295lbs. You must change your diet and exercise.""",3
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I am 5&#039; 6&quot; and was 190 lbs. when I started this medicine. I began taking this medication 3 weeks ago as part of the Doctor G&#039;s Weight Loss Program.  At the end of 2 weeks, I was down 9 pounds.  I don&#039;t get weighed again until Week 4.

I have not been hungry at all.  I am only taking half the recommended dose because I truly believe that taking medication is never healthy.  However, I am in the military and need to lose weight for this year&#039;s waist measurement.  A hysterectomy has really screwed things up for me.""",2
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I am 46/F/305 lbs......I just started premiere weight loss center yesterday.I am doing 500 cal right now, phentermine 37.5 daily, and get weekly b-complex injections......I tried this back in 2011, had great success, lost 60lbs in about 4 months.....due to a shoulder injury and surgery, had to stop...was layed up for 18 months, ugh......then I changed jobs, got divorce...life got in the way, lol. So today is my first day back on it...the phen has started working immediately already...I&#039;m having to force myself to eat...I think I&#039;m going to try some high protein, low cal shakes....easier for my lifestyle as well....I&#039;m in the nursing field and always on the go. I hate water, but love Dt coke...will check in after 1st weigh in 4/22!!!""",2
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""Been on and off this medication since November 2014 after a stint of three days with no sleeping thanks to my chronic anxiety/panic disorder.  Started out on 50 mg but I couldn&#039;t tolerate it, so I tapered it down to 25 mg and it worked like a charm. The first few days are awful with the dizziness, foggy head, just getting the day started can be a royal pain. However, I had some amazing sleep taking this, just hated the feeling of being drugged. I tried going cold turkey off this medication and let me be the first to say DO NOT GO COLD TURKEY!  I was so sick and shakey, muscle cramps/spasms, severe vomiting, worst flu like feeling you&#039;ll ever have. I broke down and cut a 25mg into 12.5 mg.  muscle pain lingers but everything else is better.""",9
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I could cry now! This is my 2nd implanon.1st wa out in 9 months due to mood swings and feeling sooo low all of the time. I cannot use combined pill due to familt history of cardiac problems and migraine myself. The POP makes me bleed constantly without a break and I ended up anaemic using the coil (IUD). Decided last year to give the implanon another go just in case it was a one off bad experience....6 months in and I has gain 20lbs and feel horrific. Anxiety++ depression++ stress++ weight++ Making an appointment to have Implanon removed. Only plus to Implanon for me is that I don&#039;t have any periods. That&#039;s the only plus. Insertion and removal is easy having done it once before. Lack of periods is great. Never again""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""My OBGYN just prescribed this medication based on 15% unexplained weight gain over the past 2 years due to peri-menopausal symptoms. I&#039;m 5&#039;10&quot; and weigh 140-145lbs. I have always maintained this weight even between and after both pregnancies. My youngest is now 5 years old and I&#039;m suddenly up to 168. I took my first dose on Tuesday (4/24) at 12:30pm. My doc warned me that if I may feel jittery (crawling out of my skin feeling) over the first few days. I&#039;m happy to report that I have had NO such ill side effect and sleeping better than before. As of this morning (4/27 Day 3) I am 165lbs. It is the best feeling I&#039;ve had in months! Make that years! It&#039;s the boost in confidence that I&#039;ve been so desperately seeking! Two thumbs up so far!""",3
Strattera,ADHD,"""I am a 37yr woman diagnosed with ADHD. 1st try with Ritalin made me feel overwhelmed, sad, uncontrollable spurts of crying for no reason, tired. Dr. switched me to Straterra. It&#039;s only my fist week, but had to share. Ok, 1st the &quot;bad&quot;: mild headache, SUPER DRY mouth, hot and sweaty, weird tingly sensation that comes in waves. Feels like my hair on my arms and head is crawling and tingly and cool for a few seconds and goes away. Clenching my jaw. No noticable improvement with racing thoughts or concentration as of yet. Now the &quot;good&quot;: This pill should be called &quot;Lady Viagra&quot;, lol! That cool, tingly, hair crawling sensation is AMAZING when being intimate. Everything is more intense and indescribably WONDERFUL...and I have been married 10yrs!""",1
Pristiq,Depression,"""After struggling with depression for  over ten years and trying over twenty different medications, I have finally found one that works. I have been on this medication for about four years and it has been life changing. I have had no side effects (which isn&#039;t common with these types of medications) The only &#039;negative&#039; thing about this medication is that if you accidentally miss a dose you will get really bad side effects.""",5
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My experience was probably the worst I&#039;ve had so far. I lost 20 lbs with 40mg of Vyvanse. I was a healthy 145 lbs, I am now 120lbs. I had horrible diarrhea, its was so bad. I was extremely faint and dizzy. I could go without sleeping and eating for almost days. I had terrible heart fluttering feelings. However it did work great for my ADHD and also for my depression and anxiety. But, of course, I struggled with malnutrition and have been struggling so much (still) with gaining the weight back. I then had taken 30mg, but then it was not enough. Finding the right medication is such a struggle..""",1
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""Okay, the original lunesta was extremely effective, I received samples. For 330 month  I couldn&#039;t get prescription. So years later they have a generic version. I got a months worth for 111$$. At 3 mg nothing......so I try 6mg.....nothing no bad or good to report! These pills are FRAUD!!!! I&#039;m well accustomed to meds and the generic I took did nothing. I&#039;d get more effect from sugar pill!! I&#039;m getting this so others can see not all generics are equal. There are various companys. I didn&#039;t know this, so if you suspect your med isn&#039;t up to particular like it used to be.....check the maker!! I&#039;m very upset about this. I&#039;m out $111 for the month for a fake pill made by the company""",0
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I am 14, and I started using Doryx about a month ago. It hasn&#039;t worked for me, actually within the first few weeks my acne got worst, bigger, redder, and more painful pimples on my face.  In the dermatologist&#039;s office he said if this doesn&#039;t work in a month give me a call and we will give you something else. So I called him today, and he tells me to use it for another month. Do you really think I want my acne to get worse. NO! I was skeptical so I got online. Some reviews say it worked instantly, others say it took months, and some even say it never worked. I guess I will keep using it for another month, but if it doesn&#039;t clear my skin I will go back to my dermatologist.""",4
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on 600mg along with 20mg of olanzapinne and 150mg of amitryptyline. I still get mood swings - not to the same extent as before but I still get them.  Sometimes I find it hard to be around other people because my mood reflects theirs so I try to keep away. On a couple of occasions I&#039;ve been on a high and I&#039;ve invited the local homeless to crash at my flat; both times I was robbed while asleep.  I&#039;m considering Lithium as an alternative to my current medications but I don&#039;t see my psychiatrist for another month so I&#039;ll let you know then if there&#039;s any change.""",6
Belviq,Obesity,"""I have been on Belviq six months and was 229 pounds. Now I am 192 pounds, lower blood pressure and bad cholesterol. Side effects early I was a little tired and headache. My will power and confidence are up 100% and my cigarette consumption is down 65% from two packs. My cravings for food and cigs are pretty mellow and I believe I will quit sooner then later. This way to easy and yes I do ride my bike daily.""",2
Duloxetine,Depression,"""This was the third medication I tried for my depression and anxiety. I&#039;m not going to lie, the entire time I was on it I felt like I was on Ecstasy 24/7. Everything was rainbows and sunshine and I felt so euphoric and amazing and warm and fuzzy. However, I had the nastiest headaches constantly, and they came on as soon as I&#039;d take the meds. Almost the entire time I felt so nauseous and I had migraines and it didn&#039;t let up. I switched at my monthly appointment because the headaches made the euphoria not worth it.""",5
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had implanon inserted a few months ago due to frustrations with the birth control pill and breakthrough bleeding. After reading many experience online the insertion experience and what side effect I may experience seemed daunting - however, I can confirm that the insertion process was only the discomfort of a needle to numb the area and then a feeling of pressure and it was all over. The area felt uncomfortable for about a week and now I hardly notice it at all. The biggest thing for me is that after 3 months I am yet to have a period or any break through bleeding. My experience so far is a positive one with no major side effects to note. I am grateful for no longer having to remember to take a pill everyday.""",8
Sertraline,Depression,"""This medicine is allowing me to focus on what is important. Started on 50mg, had feelings of euphoria for the first couple of days, then a few of the regular side effects such as little sleep, nausea and suicidal ideation, which eventually all passed. I also had bloodshot eyes for a while, most likely due to lack of sleep and working night shift. 
I have gone up to 100mg as I was feeling anxiety effects in the evening and had started taking one at night as well as in the morning. 
I am not worrying about the smaller things, important events still cause me some anxiety but I am able to tackle them with a clearer mind instead of the anxiety crippling my ability for action. 
I can tell this medication will help me get my priorities in order.""",5
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""My doc switched me to this due to some issues with morphine sulphate ER 15mg three times a day.  He put me on the Hysingla ER at 20mg once a day with the oxy 15mg x2 for breakthru pain.  Been on it for two days and am in constant pain at a 6/7 level.  With the other med I was 4/5 on bad days. So disappointed not too mention the cost is more than double for me.  Don&#039;t know if the dose is just two low considering how long I&#039;ve been on pain meds  Guess I could ask him to up it to 40mg and see if that works.  20mg isn&#039;t hacking it at all.  So tired of the government sticking its nose into my health.""",9
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I was diagnosed with B.E.D, P.T.S.D, and Depression.  My doctor put me on this medication about a week ago and I feel so much better!  I have tried a lot of other anti-depressants and none of them have ever worked for me.  They would make me sleep more (and usually I sleep like 14-16 hours a day anyway) and just feel emotionally numb.  I am currently sleeping 8 hours a night and waking up feeling energized.  It has also helped with the B.E.D.  Yesterday was my first day not having the issues I usually have with food.  I seen some comments that say the person felt good for a while and then in wore off.  I am currently on 150MG and on Monday I will increase to 300MG.  I will comment again when I have been on it for a few months :)""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am 47, 5&#039;11&quot; male with a BMI of 40.  I was considering bariatric surgery but decided to try Contrave first.  My starting weight was 287.  I&#039;m now in week 3 of taking Contrave.  The first two weeks were fine, no side effects, and I noticed that my appetite was diminished.  I lost about 7 pounds.  Now, at the start of week 3, I went up to 3 pills/day, and the nausea hit big time.  I&#039;ll push through it, and try to space out taking the pills during the day.  

So the jury is still out.  Will check back in after the end of week 4.""",2
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m still in my trial and error period in trying to find something to help me with my mood swings / bipolar  anger management but I have to say by the second pill I&#039;ve been pretty much bed ridden with severe dizziness, vomiting, vertigo like symptoms I have immediately stopped taking it on my own I&#039;ve been in the bed 4 days now just waiting till my next appointment hopefully it&#039;s just a severe side effect or allergic reaction because I wouldn&#039;t recommend this for my worst enemy hopefully no one else has to experience what I have""",6
Differin,Acne,"""Its been over a month using the over the counter.  I posted previously.   I had started out using once every three days and then went to every two days to make sure no issues.  Skin got very dry at first. 

Apply each evening about two hours before going to bed.  In the AM I apply Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture with Sunscreen SPF 35 and re-apply as needed. 

Had several blackheads mature during the month.  Some were under the skin surface.  All gone.  A few whiteheads.  Skin has calmed down considerable.  Skin seems healthier. No longer use Benzoyl Peroxide.""",4
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My daughter started this, she was tired and first but we moved it to a later time.  After two months we moved her up to 2mg as she was still unfocused. Well I haven&#039;t slept in weeks, she is up alot at night won&#039;t sleep in her room anymore. We switched to taking it in the morning and thought it was a faze, i will be making an appointment to talk to her pediatrician. It was our choice as a nonstimulant and im not going to put her on one. Hopefully there is something  else out there that will work as great during the day but not nightmares. We live in Canada and thankfully our insurance pays for it but that&#039;s not a reason to stay on it.""",1
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;ve tried several over the counter Acne medications and washes, home made applications and NOTHING seemed to work. I saw a commercial on Differin Gel and literally told myself, &quot; sure, another acne med that claims to be effective &quot; I figured, I might as well give it try considering I was beginning to accept my terrible acne.
I saw results in a week or so and so did my family n friends. I am almost 2 months in and my face is practically clear, even the dark acne scars vanished. 
I highly recommend Differin Gel to Everyone that is suffering from mild to severe acne, I promise!! 
I always apply the gel after washing my face in the evening, applying the gel all over my face and jaw bone. 
Good luck!""",4
Copper,Birth Control,"""I was very happy with my paraguard for the first 6mos. Then my partner began complaining that he felt it poking him during sex and I would have cramping after sex. I went in for an ultrasound to check the placement. Found out it had moved into my cervix. Luckily I found out and was not pregnant, but this seems to be more common than I thought. I got it removed and it was horribly painful. Much worse than the insertion. My doctor said it was curled or twisted and that is why it hurt so badly coming out. I had painful cramping after the removal and am now feeling upset that I have to find another alternative for birth control- again.""",8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I highly encourage anyone struggling with acne to ask their dermatologist about accutane. I&#039;ve struggled with mild but persistent acne for years. I was placed on an antibiotic for almost two years after trying topical treatments. This antibiotic worked for me for a few months but I still had breakouts. I have just finished my 6 month round of accutane. I am honestly in love with this drug. My skin is flawless and I am happier with it then I have ever been. The only side effect I had to deal with was dry lips which wasn&#039;t bad. My skin never felt dry, it actually feels softer.""",4
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have to say this is a great medicine for people to try especially if those having difficulty sleeping.  I had mania and my highs and lows have become stable.  I have been taking this for about a month and noticed a difference the next day.  It does have an awful taste but it is worth the benefits.  My cocktail currently for Bipolar 1 is Effexor XR, Depakote, Lamictal, and Saphris.  I plan to ween off some of these medicines since Saphris has been working well.  I have tried Abilify and Seroquel and had bad reactions.""",6
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was prescribed this for a mood disorder they couldn&#039;t pin down (didn&#039;t know where on the bipolar spectrum I fell, I suppose) as well as sleeping issues.

I became very jaded, too jaded. I didn&#039;t get any more sleep than usual, and my previously sun-sensitive skin is now showing minor allergic reactions to sunlight. I haven&#039;t been on it for years, and the allergy is still there.
It did nothing for me and just made it harder for me to operate in the typically diurnal society of today. Not a positive experience.""",6
Neurontin,Pain,"""I have been taking Gabapentin the generic for Neurontin for about three years.  I am having really dramatically disturbing dreams about all of my dead relatives.  This is really disturbing me.  I have had all tests possible on my neck and back.  I have had one surgery on my neck and am waiting on another surgery on it.  They keep giving me injections I am sure just to pass time.  The injections have done nothing for me.  Neither did the RFS (Radio Frequency Stimulation) for carterizing the nerve endings.  They now have me on Skelaxin as well but there is no difference.  This has been going on for six years after an accident at work. """,9
Methadone,Pain,"""I have dealt with back pain for the last 15  years.  I have tried all of the traditional pain medications. Each one of them had their limited success, as well as their own side effects. Methadone is the only medication that has given me complete relief with only the occasional breakthrough or flare up. The best part is I can function with a clear head and no high. This has to be one of the best solutions to date for my pain. I would highly recommend long time suffers of Neuropathy as well as chronic back pain discuss methadone as a possible treatment with their care provider.""",9
Sertraline,Depression,"""Another poster said that Sertraline made her a better person.  That&#039;s really true for me. I wish I had started taking it years ago.  I don&#039;t get the full benefit with less than 100mg per day. Unfortunately, I have to stop taking Sertraline as I have a worsening spinal condition and I have to take NSAIDs (ibuprofen) for pain control.  When I take the two drugs together I bruise so easily that I worry about more serious bleeding.  For me, Sertraline has also reduced my libido.  I&#039;m a male in my 60s but I&#039;m not yet ready to give up on sex, nor is my wife.""",5
Paroxetine,Depression,"""My doctor started me on Paxil when I was 6 months pregnant. It made me emotionally numb. I kept taking it for about 3 years because the side effects of missing a dose were unbearable. I had to have the dose increased and eventually was on the highest dose and Xanax was added. I gained weight, was always tired, had a decreased sex drive and I couldn&#039;t cry when I needed to. I attempted to stop taking it 5 times before I was successful. I had horrible withdrawals for two months... sensitivity to light, nausea, a jolting sensation through my head and arms and uncontrollable crying. It was worth it. I am now taking Zoloft and finally feel normal. I lost the weight I gained while I was on Paxil and I cry when I need to.""",5
Sertraline,Depression,"""I have been on Zoloft for about 6 weeks. I was experiencing depression which manifested itself in crying spells, anger, helplessness and loss of motivation. It took approximately 4 weeks for me to notice any changes,  but I have noticed recently that I have motivation once again and I have not experienced any side effects which i was dreading such as loss of sexual desire and weight gain.  I feel like my normal self again and able now to handle the issues of my life  Prior to this I was sad a lot and having many crying bouts.  I haven&#039;t noticed any negative side effects whatsoever.""",5
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""Well I have been on this drug since 2009.  I do not know I had an issue until I had a seizure after coming out of the shower.  I had all kinds of tests, and then went to a sleep lab.  There they said I never entered into REM.  So I was totally sleep deprived. I was put on .5mg and it did the trick.  I had the real dream and restless leg syndrome where my wife was scared of me.  I would yell kick and literally act my dream out and I would wake up exhausted.  Since 2009 I&#039;m getting roughly 6 hr of sleep a night.  It is awesome.  Still have some nights, once a month depending on stress.  I travel internationally and my sleep schedule is messed up so I&#039;m sure it doesn&#039;t help.  But it has worked for me thus far.""",0
Xanax,Anxiety,"""This pill works miracles for me.

It is completely effective against all of my anxiety. It also makes me feel less OCD. I no longer obsess over thoughts or worry while I am on this. Xanax unleashes my creativity. I play guitar, write music and draw a lot. I used to do all these things but have thought I lost interest because I had no inspiration.

I have no side effects except some memory loss and tiredness.

I wish my doctor would up my prescription, I am on 2 mg a day and for the past nine months I have always finished my prescription in 1 - 2 weeks. But this does well for keeping tolerance low and avoiding addiction and dependence. I am on it for 2 weeks and then off until my refill.""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been taking doxycycline for about a year know and it is amazing!!!!! I has terrible acne during my 7th grade year and had very low self-esteem. So I made my parents take me to a doctor and he prescribe me doxycycline. He told me it would get worse before it got better! After a month of taking it I could notice the difference and today I only get an acne spot every 3 months to 4 it&#039;s amazing and I totally RECOMMEND it!!! BUT there are some side effects, do not take it with MILK trust me I was either on the bathroom floor crying or throwing up!! Also take it with a big meal like dinner.
And if you want something with MILK for dinner, wait a few hours after drinking the MILK and take it with some crackers. Hopefully this helped!""",4
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I gained 60 pounds in under 2 years from being on  gabapentin for arthritis and fibromyalgia. I learned I had pre diabetes &amp; asked my Dr to put me on it and she was more than willing. 40 pounds melted off me like butter in less than 2 months no problem, UNTIL... MY LONG BLONDE HAIR was clogging the drain every day in the shower! Long story short, what&#039;s the point in being skinny if your bald? I HAD pretty hair, now 3/4 of it&#039;s gone and still not growing back! Makes me wonder what other damage it&#039;s done.  Not worth it!!""",2
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on Contrave full dosage for 2 months and I have lost 20lbs. I am not binging and my appetite is under control. It seems to have changed HOW I eat and WHAT I eat.  I previously bolted my food down and drank in gulps, I now take small bites and chew my food, it is as if my body cannot handle the scarfing. I am able to drive past fast food restaurants without wanting to stop and binge. I am typically no longer hungry at night. I am also trying to help the medicine by exercising and not fighting it by attempting to continue down the road I was on before. It has also helped my mood, I seem to have more energy and no longer feel the need for naps. I hope it continues to prove successful.""",2
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Also I forgot to mention in a previous review that timing is the key to these types of drugs. 1.5 hours is the time it takes to work for me but may vary with different people. Sometimes I get to my night class early and take a Klonopin well in advance so I wont be under the influence when I&#039;m driving to class. Basically you have to experiment at first with the timing to get a feel of works best for you.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I wanted to share my positive experience. I first had mine inserted Aug 2013 at my University&#039;s nurse&#039;s office. The numbing shot really stung, but I didn&#039;t feel the incision or insertion at all. I had bruising on my arm for a few days. For a few weeks after my arm would ache. I have a small, barely-there scar from the incision (looks like a beauty mark/mole). I consistently had periods every other month for 3-5 days. I&#039;ve gained no weight, had no acne break outs, and have not gotten pregnant. I was using b/c pills for over a year before switching to this method. I think it&#039;s a more hassle-free method; don&#039;t have to worry about human error. I will be getting another one inserted in Aug since my 3 years is about to be up.""",8
Phentermine,Obesity,"""37 yo, mother of four children; 18y, 12y, 2y, 10 mos. I&#039;ve been overweight then obese pretty much all my life. The older I get, the harder it is to try to lose weight it seems. My Dr. put me on Phentermine 37.5 last week. As of that appointment on 5/25 my starting weight was 260lb. As of 6/2, my current weight is 252lb. it&#039;s a huge challenge to try to eat as my appetite is GONE this first week. It&#039;s slowly coming back. the energy boost is great and much needed with 4 kids!""",2
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I have tried every diet under the sun, have worked with numerous personal trainers, and although I have been faithful 85% of the time on any diet I have been on, I have never been able to lose weight at a healthy rate. I normally have to do an extreme diet to see any progress and then my body will fight tooth and nail for the weight to come back. 3 months ago, I spoke to my doctor and she recommended Belviq because it has the least chance of side effects. I do have them though. For the first month, I would say headaches were pretty bad, but I would take Excedrin. But the tiredness that has lasted for the entire time, though it is not debilitating, it does effect my desire to work out. I have lost steadily though, 1.5-2pds a week at 1550 cal""",3
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I have had this birth control since last October and I have gain A LOT  of weight! I was told by my obgyn that I wouldn&#039;t gain any weight and that this was the better option. But in my opinion its not. I weighed 125 the day that I got this and here it is not even a year yet and I weight 185 I gained 60 lbs and it is getting worst. It is extremely hard to lose it. I also play sports and things but the birth control makes me very lazy and tired all the time. All I want to do is sleep! I would not recommend this to anyone. My period is so crazy one minute i have one and then I don&#039;t have one for about 2 months. This might just be my reaction from my body but I still wouldn&#039;t recommend it for anyone.""",8
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Wellbutrin for about four weeks to ease my social anxiety issues. I have never taken anti-depressants before so I had no idea what to expect. I&#039;m glad the first week is over because it was very euphoric, which I did not enjoy. I had to take a nap around 4:00 p.m. the first day. The second week was not euphoric at all and I feel back to my old self again. Gratitude all around.""",5
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""This drug worked wonders for me! I had terrible insomnia, and was averaging only a few hours of sleep a night. I started taking 2mg of Lunesta a year ago. It helped me with anxiety and allowed me to get 8 hours of sleep a night.

I have always been afraid of forming a dependency on sleep aids, so after one year of using Lunesta I weaned myself off, just to put my mind to ease. It was very easy to do! I cut my pill in half for a few weeks, then stopped taking it. No withdrawal symptoms. I then decided to keep taking 1 mg but its comforting for me to know that I&#039;m not dependent on it.

Taking this drug was the best decision I ever made. If 
I swallow it immediately with water, I don&#039;t get a bad taste.""",0
Duac,Acne,"""Honestly, when I set out to try this - I wasn&#039;t too sure what to expect. My skin was awful, and the horrid acne I had was so painful and built up that I couldn&#039;t properly cover it with makeup any more. 

I went on a combination of Duac gel and an antibiotic two months ago. Today, I only have one spot. 

I began to notice a difference to my skin the day after I first applied it. My skin had dried out immensely and the spots seemed to be going down. I was so happy. 

For the first three or so weeks of using Duac, my skin was a rollercoaster. At first my face was getting so dry that by the morning I was putting on a hefty layer of e45 cream under my makeup. Now, I don&#039;t use any. My skin no longer needs it. It&#039;s changed the oiliness of my skin""",4
Percocet,Pain,"""I am 26 years old and have a 4 year old. I wad diagnosed with scoliosis in my upper and lower spine at 13 years of age, and recently 5 bulged disc, sciatica, and a severe pinched nerve along with the sciatic. At first my doctor gave me a script for Percocet and I was able to function. She now will not prescribe the Percocet again, even though the pain clinic has recommended it for me. I also work 80 hours a week through the excruciating pain. """,9
Saxenda,Obesity,"""A very disappointing experience.The cost of the monthly supply was not the only negative factor.
The nausea, the not feeling myself and the  unusual liver test were all deterrents to continuing on the program.

After 2 months I could not go on  yes I lost some weight but not enough to continue with the horrible side effects of the drug and all the weight came back on.

We are human and always looking for the quick fix, however this product is dangerous and the Pharmaceutical company that released it should refund all people that it did not work on.""",2
Fentanyl,Pain,"""I have severe pain left over from my chemotherapy I took for breast cancer. I took Percocet for a year but was having break through pain. I decided to try the pain patch which I started out at 25mg and worked my way up to where my pain stopped. I am now pain free at 75mg every three days. I have been pain free for 4 months. I am so happy. I was crying every morning because the pain medicines would not last through the night, not anymore. I am able to work in the yard and do housework pain free. I forgot to tell you the pain was in my lower legs, it was terrible.""",9
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""I always sleep after 2.30am. It wasn&#039;t really a problem since I&#039;m a freelancer and I could work anytime I want. But sometimes I need to wake up early in the morning I&#039;ve always use Alprazolam to help me get to sleep early.  I don&#039;t like the feeling of taking it, it makes me sleep so fast and it doesn&#039;t feel natural.

I then read about this Melatonin and bought the 3mg, I didn&#039;t take one whole pill, I divided into 2 part. So I just took 1.5mg.. And you know what it works wonder for me! I feel sleepy after taking it and the sleepy feeling was so natural and I also woke with no drowsiness.. 

If you had sleeping problem try this one first.. Make sure you take the lowest dosage before you raise it...""",0
Diclofenac,Pain,"""After being born breech, and having both hips dislocated at a time when operations were not thought of.
Then giving birth to 7 wonderful children in a short stretch of time.
The stress to my hips has taken a crippling tole.
I was rarely ever able to get myself out of bed without the feeling of train spikes stabbing into my hips.
Voltarane gel enabled me to start my day but the Diciofenac slow release 75mg. Allows me to work my eight hours and come home to enjoy time with my kids instead of going directly to bed in too much pain to live life.""",9
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I had moderate to severe acne starting around the age of 15/16, right around when I got my first period. By age 20 my skin still wasn&#039;t clear, even on Yaz. That medication did wonders for my endometriosis and cramps, but my skin didn&#039;t get better. I talked to my doctor about spiro and we agreed that it was a good plan. 100mg/day for the first month, then down to 50mg/day. The idea was to &quot;shock my system&quot; for a big clearing. That first month was TERRIBLE. I broke out like never before with massive cystic, painful zits. My self esteem was worse than ever. BUT, I stuck with it. Today I&#039;m on my 6th month of spiro and I LOVE it. I sometimes get a zit here or there, but nothing like before-- mostly just blackheads. My skin is even and clear!""",4
Ambien,Insomnia,"""This medicine, combined with 15mg of Remeron (the sedating antidepressant) has improved my quality of life ten-fold! Ambien (zolpidem) works very quickly and puts me to sleep within 20 minutes; Remeron works more slowly and keeps me in a deep, restful sleep. I&#039;ve tried both medicines in isolation, with limited success. Taking only zolpidem gives me a short sleep of  about 4 hours.  On its own, Remeron will put me to sleep for 7-9 hours but takes two hours to start working. The combination of the two is perfectly synergistic!  It&#039;s the &quot;silver bullet&quot; to my insomnia and low-grade depression, which I&#039;ve had all of my 35 years. I&#039;ve never been happier or healthier!""",0
Accutane,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on Accutane for almost 4 months now. My skin is getting better everyday and I&#039;m really happy with the physical results. However, Accutane began to give me depression during the first week and it has stuck with me since. Although the side effect has not gotten worse (and won&#039;t, I&#039;ve asked my dermatologist). It&#039;s definitely not good and I&#039;ve read that it won&#039;t go away until a few months after I have finished my course. NOTE: I had already suffered depression before beginning the course &amp; it is hereditary in my family.""",4
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m an eighteen year old female and I started taking these 100mg doxycycline monohydrate pills only four days ago because they worked great for my brothers. I&#039;ve been taking them with tons of water and food. They seem to work so far but I&#039;ve been waking up with terrible migraine-like headaches and confusion. I&#039;m usually an early riser and a morning person but these make me feel really nauseated. I don&#039;t recommend them for anyone who gets migraines like I do.""",4
Vilazodone,Depression,"""I ended up having a very bad experience with Viibyrd, due to its drug interactions with Xanax I&#039;m taking for anxiety. The first month was wonderful though. After the first dose, I felt amazing; I felt calm, content, and had energy to get through my day. It did give me nausea sometimes, so I had to make sure I ate a big breakfast to avoid that.

Things started to get bad during the second month. My mood wasn&#039;t as amazing as before &amp; some suicidal thoughts came back. Then, I began experiencing hallucinations&mdash; visual, closed-eyed, even musical. It was pretty horrifying and made my depression and anxiety TREMENDOUSLY worse altogether. My doc immediately took me off Viibyrd &amp; switched to Celexa. 

Viibryd co-pay was also very expensive.""",5
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Our son has gone through 3 other medicines, and this is the only one that has worked with no side effects.   We have noticed that it wears off at the end of the school day, so after school activities are a little more challenging.   He struggles a little in the evening, since it&#039;s definitely worn off by then, but what it does for him in school is great.  We&#039;re looking into options to help him in the evening without messing up his sleep.""",1
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m writing this review for all of the women skeptical of IUDs (since I was one of them). I became pregnant in November of 2015 after a condom failed for my boyfriend and I. We were not in a place to have a child, and terminated the pregnancy (which was something I NEVER thought I would do, so please don&#039;t judge). We decided we needed a better form of birth control (had been on the pill with bad side effects), and chose skyla. The insertion happened the first day of my period and was a BREEZE. A slight pinch and that was it! I&#039;ve had period cramps that were worse! Slight cramps the first two days but ibuprofen took them away. It&#039;s been great since! PLEASE dont let reviews scare you away! They almost did for me, but I&#039;m glad they didn&#039;t!""",8
Vilazodone,Depression,"""After reading many reviews I have to say I was very nervous to start Viibryd. I started on a day off from work. The first 3 days I had a slight headache and very slight GI issues. After taking Tylenol my headache was relieved. Definitely recommend taking with food. I just started week 2 at 20 mg. So far so good. No headache or GI upset. No interruption in sleep patterns so far. I feel very calm taking the medication. I will be excited to see what week 3 brings. My kids and husband thanks Viibryd already!""",5
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""March 2016 I started to take Saxenda, starting weight was 198 lb. now March 2017 my weight is 110 lb. After realizing the best time to take  Saxenda was at night before going to bed it helped with all side effects. It&#039;s all about trial and era. Some foods don&#039;t sit to well and weight loss has slowed down but on an overall experience it&#039;s been great I would recommend this to anybody needing help to kick start the weight loss. One thing that must be done to help along the progress is working out. In the beginning I walked everywhere. Now I run a few times a week to maintain the weight. It&#039;s a never ending cycle but can be managed with time and effort. Good luck to you all.""",2
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I started off at .50 mg then to 1mg before bed.  I had many issues going on in life and I was having trouble falling asleep.  This helped in the beginning, but my dose is going up and up. I admit, I take this more than I should, so I understand there&#039;s an addictive nature to this.  Just be careful, and talk to your doctor if you notice that.  The best part of this drug; I get a good night sleep and I&#039;m not waking up 3x a night.""",7
Duloxetine,Pain,"""My MD prescribed Cymbalta for chronic pain caused by disc bulges, in addition to treating my previously diagnosed depression and anxiety.

I took my first dose around noon, and by 2pm had a pounding headache. As the day continued, I began to have tremors and convulsions, blurred vision and was very disoriented. At 10 pm my heart rate and breathing were very rapid and I had mild hallucinations. I rode it out for the rest of the night and after about 3 hours most of the side effects had faded with the exception of the headache. Unfortunately, the worst side effects was yet to come, graphic vivid nightmares. My doctor took me off the medication, after one dose, three days ago. """,9
Voltaren Gel,Pain,"""I have fibromyalgia with chronic fatigue syndrome, degenerative disc disease, a bulging disc in my lower back with arthritis of the face joints and in my hands. I hurt my back June 2010 and it is like everything that caused me pain started to feed off one another and my back was the last straw. I&#039;m going to the chiropractor every 2 weeks. I had 3 epidurals in the space of about 3-4 months with no relief. I swapped pain management doctors and am now on 15mg of oxycodone every 6 hours, 4mg Zanaflex every 8 hours, 500mg of Naproxen every 12 hours, 40mg Celexa once a day and 600mg of Neurontin every 8 hours just to sort of be able to function. Was given a sample of Voltaren today and used it on my hands and back. Amazing! The pain is greatly diminished. Can&#039;t wait to try more.""",9
Tylox,Pain,"""This is really strange. My mom, who has Alzheimers was given this drug to help her recover from a hysterectomy.  We have found a definite connection between Tylox and her Alzheimers- it&#039;s greatly improved! She regained about 18 months of mental deterioration from the Alzheimers after taking this drug. No one can understand why there&#039;s a connection. When she stopped taking Tylox, her Alzheimers once again became worse. When we restarted Tylox, once again, her mental capacity improved tremendously.""",9

Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""Latuda has changed my life.  I&#039;ve been treated with everything under the sun since I was 20 years old.  Within days of taking the Latuda I felt like a normal person.  I don&#039;t know if I EVER felt so genuinely happy, light-hearted, motivated to make life changes.  It&#039;s like a miracle.  I don&#039;t experience any side effects.  I don&#039;t feel tremendously hungry either, as I have with other anti psychotics.  I only hope it continues to keep my bipolar at bay.

First I tried adderall, it didn&#039;t do much but make me a bit irritable, and still not focusing was on 50mg a day 30mg in the morning and a 20mg in the afternoon, and I didn&#039;t notice a thing. Next was the generic of Focalin, which dild absolutely NOTHING! With vyvanse I feel like I can concentrate on one thing at a time, and not have the urge to start 10 other things.

Side effects I&#039;ve noticed this far, still bouts of nausea and only threw up once. I recommend taking with food and lots of water. Dry mouth seems to have subsided, still have a slight hum in my ears and my right hand twitches mildly intermittently. I have energy, an overall feeling of well being and 90% control over my eating. Sticking to a 1400 calorie or less diet with no trouble. Scale down program is very encouraging. I feel like I eat breakfast, small lunch and then am just not hungry the rest of the day, amazing how it turns off desire to eat mindlessly. Some taste changes, I love eggs, but can&#039;t eat now.

Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Vyvance is the 4th medicine we&#039;ve tried for our 7 year old son&#039;s ADHD.  He has been on Vyvance for close to a month now.  With Vyvance, he still has a personality, it has a more natural, gradual start and end so he seems more balanced overall.  With other medications, he would suddenly switch back to wild and impulsive as if you flipped a switch.  The negative is that his appetite is definitely low.  He has no interest in food during the day but gets hungry late at night.  He is not falling asleep well at all, still awake after 2 hours of lying in bed.  This is definitely due to the medication. He would always fall asleep within about 15 minutes.  We&#039;ve yet to find the right one, but this is definitely the best so far.""",1

I have lost over 20 pounds and am eating less and am more on average scale of what a human being should be consuming on a daily basis. I love this medicine. It helps me think clearly meaning I am much more calm and stabilized with my bi-polar. The ONLY complaint I have is I am constantly having heat-flashes. I am male by the way. I have asked many different psychiatrists, pharmacy, and my PCP about it. None have ever found that to be part of the side effects. I rather deal with this then major weight gain from Abilify.""",6

The only pain killer that has ever worked for my migraines was Demerol, and I don&#039;t see my doctor giving me that any time soon.

My weight is coming off a little slower than most Lol but I&#039;ve always had to work harder for my results, the reason I started this medication.

Like every other time, Lexapro works almost immediately for me - my PVC&#039;s and agoraphobia have muted drastically on only 5mg a day! Yes there is slight weight gain and potential sexual side effects but I&#039;ll take those over the other stuff any day. It&#039;s cliche but I do feel like I have my life back.

It really &quot;causes&quot; sleep, you&#039;ll feel sleepy, but not relaxed at all. It&#039;s not like a benzodiazepine(alprazolam/clonazepam/etc).

Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed this drug after a car 1996 accident which I had several skull fractures and brain injuries etc.  Was kept in coma for weeks to allow brain rest and healing.  This drug has had me totally controlled as a hostage to this.  3 days ago I finally finished taking this drug after a 3 night reduction of med. and I am feeling weird yet not too bad either and am using 3mg melatonin twice a night  and am getting  some sleep w/o xanax!!!!  I am free now and will not be a slave to this forever!""",0
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I am bipolar and my whole life struggled with getting a good night&#039;s sleep.  Ambien 10MG worked great for 2 months, then stopped working well unless I chewed the pill and took it with 0.5 Klonopin.  Switched to Ambien CR but Ambien CR gives me less sleep - I know it says its supposed to keep you asleep longer and better but regular Ambien would give me 5 hours, wake up for the restroom (drink a lot of water as on lithium for bipolar) and if I take a tiny bite of a 0.5 Klonopin tablet, able to go back to sleep. Doctor gave me trazadone to help me sleep better as Ambien 10MG doesn&#039;t knock me out like at first after a few months -- trazodone with Ambien definitely knocked me out for 9 hours -- probably longer but the alarm was set.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Vyvanse has helped me immensely as my focus is much better and I have had no ill effects whatsoever. The loss of appetite effect has been very welcome with growing older (I am 46). I have struggled with a sedentary lifestyle and my weight kept increasing. Since taking Vyvanse I have lost 50lbs and that has helped my sleep apnea to the point that I feel much better in the morning and I am not at the same weight I was when I got married 17 years ago. I am 200 lbs 6&#039;1&quot; and have worked up from the initial 10Mg dosage to the max now at 70Mg. I have been on Vyvanse for about a year and a half.""",1
Lidoderm,Pain,"""I tried using the over the counter 4% lidocaine and had some relief. I talked to a pharmacist who said that the Mylan should give about 25% more relief. I tried it-purchased 30-5% pads that cost about $.30 more than the over the counter per patch. The Mylan are inflexible and I have to tape them on. I will not buy more. I may talk to my doctor about just using the over the counter and adding a little more lidocaine cream. My recommendation is that customers should not waste their money on these. I also read that the Mylan company is registered in the Netherlands with its main office in the U.S. So, this is a company that can well afford to create an effective product since they obviously do not pay much in U.S. taxes-SHAME""",9
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""It works well for Meniere&#039;s disease aka as vertigo but does absolutely nothing for my anxiety/panic attacks. I have been on 7.5 mg twice a day for 7 months prior I was on 5mg twice a day. I gave it a 4 because it helps the Meniere&#039;s but not the anxiety. I was also put on Zoloft but had to stop after 14 days do to side effects. I was only on 12.5mg tried 25mg and had horrible side effects.""",7
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had insomnia for over a year now and I had been taking a small amount of xanax at night and an ambien cr.  I typically would get 5-6 hrs sleep with this combo.   Not ideal but it is what it is.  I heard of belsomra and asked my doc to write me a prescription.   I haven&#039;t taken ambien for the past 3 nights as my script ran out and I was waiting on my pharmacy to get belsomra in.

Anyways took belsomra 15 mg waited,  nothing.   Took remaining 5 mg an hour later still nothing.   Basically laid in bed all night with very little light sleep. 
Sucks cuz this drug is expensive and was hoping it would work better than my current combo.   Guess I&#039;m going to have to stick with ambien.  Might try Lunesta see how that works.""",0
Differin,Acne,"""I have been using this gel for about 2 weeks now and have had nothing but positive results. I&#039;m not exaggerating when I say this starting working on my skin immediately. I have been going through bad cystic acne breakouts and hormonal acne for the past two years now. Since I started using the differin, my breakouts are minimal with only one or two pimples but nothing like before. I was breaking out with 3-5 new pimples daily and the differin stopped that from happening immediately. I have extremely oily skin so the differin did not dry out my skin. I have also changed my face cleansing products and also changed my foundation at the same time. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is at their wits end with adult acne.""",4
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am 20 and on 750 mg of Depakote a day. Gained 10-15 pounds within the first month of taking this medication, but now my weight is remaining stable. I am eating healthier and running each day though. When I first started taking it, I was so restless/anxious, I had to pace around like mad. It took about 3 weeks to really end my mania in combination with 2 mg risperidone. I am experiencing easy bruising now. Sleeping 10 hours a night. Have an irregular period. In general I move more slowly. I am cloudy in the morning. I don&#039;t get upset with my family anymore.""",6
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I have a bulging disc and low back that has displaced nerves.  I live with pain everyday due to fibromyalgia and arthritis, but this back pain is off the charts. Nothing helped.  Just started Neurontin this week.  Makes me feel a little tired, but tends to keep me awake.  So far it has knocked pain down to a level I can live with. If take pain medicine with it, don&#039;t feel any pain.  Am noticing my hands feel swollen hope it doesn&#039;t get worse as I tend to have the rare side effects on any medicine I take.""",9
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""I never had ADD or problems focusing and staying motivated before I had chemotherapy for Ewing&#039;s Sarcoma at 16-17 years old. I&#039;m now 24 and started being treated for those symptoms with Focalin XR earlier this year. It was night and day difference for me. I had energy, yes the first week I was shakey but that stops, I lost weight gained from conituning to eat like a weight lifting football player but had very little movement at all. I felt great, I can get things done now. Motivation is now just lacking from my lack of trying but when I get on something I blaze through it. Negative effects I have experienced are occasional moodiness, especially if I am focused on something and then get interrupted. Caffeine is a no no.""",1
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I have been on several different SSRIs before and haven&#039;t seen much improvement. So far, this seems to be the only antidepressant that&#039;s worked for me and hasn&#039;t given me too many side effects. I was on Luvox, which wasn&#039;t helping at all for any of the multiple conditions it was prescribed to treat, and was switched to an equivalent dose of Prozac. Ever since starting it, I&#039;ve had more energy and have been able to smile, laugh, and overall just feel like a normal person. For me, in combination with Seroquel, Adderall (for ADHD, but also gives what I take for depression a little boost), and Wellbutrin, this is a wonder drug. It still helps me get through every day after quite a few months on it. Couldn&#039;t say the same about other SSRIs.""",5
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""My daughter started this medication about 3 months ago. Her grades and reading levels have soared and we don&#039;t have as much trouble getting her to concentrate on homework but when it comes time for bed, she&#039;s a handful and irritable still when confronted with certain tasks to be done like chores. I am not going to consider another medication on top of this but will instead consider a behavior intervention.""",1
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been on Saxenda for several months now. It is the only thing I have been on where I see consistent weight loss. I am down 25lbs. Yes, there are side effects. However, I realized that most of the burping, throwing up, and gas is due to eating fried foods or greasy foods. I learned that with this medicine you have to eat healthy. You can&#039;t expect to lose weight and continue to eat the same way, well you can if you plan on being sick daily. Once I stopped eating that stuff, I have gone without the gas, the throwing up and burping side effects. In addition, the side effects are not gone because my body is used to the medication. After weeks without being sick, I went out of town and the side effects returned, because my bad eating habits returned as well.""",2
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I tried tretinoin 0.05% a year ago and I stopped as it didn&#039;t have any effect no side effects either. So I went back to the doctor a month ago and the doctor said it can take up to 6 months before I could see any results but it&#039;s worth doing.  So I used the same cream and again I didn&#039;t notice any results until 3 weeks which gave dramatic improvement. It hasn&#039;t dried out my skin. My advice is stick at this medicine for at least 6 months because it&#039;s worth it. Take doxycycline antibiotics at early stages to help with negative side effects of acne getting worse in early stages.""",4
Strattera,ADHD,"""Strattera has changed my life, my relationships, and the way I feel about my self. This drug takes time to get into your system mine took about 2 months, with some uncomfortable side effects at first, but one you over come those this medicine truly works. The problem is most people just want to jump to the next drug. I feel like a normal human being I&#039;m no longer extremely reactive, irritable, irrational, and emotionally all over. I have found to be emotional yet stable (I&#039;m not just some zombie) I am not constantly making impulse decisions. I have improved my relationships with my family and friends and feel finally like my self and have control over my life. So great film and I hope many others find the same happiness. female 21""",1
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I wanted to do an updated review on this medication. I am in my 9th month of taking it, and, before Obama Care I ran out a few times, and the effects were very noticeable. Even though it is not supposed to have classic SSRI withdrawal symptoms, I still had severe brain zaps. I have my script filled and I am back on it. I am such a better worker, listener and planner on this medication. I am a better version of myself. Love it! I take 40mg a day, 60mg was too much.  I am 160lbs tall female 34 yo.""",1
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""So I had it inserted on the 6th day of my period. I think that&#039;s why I had issues with it. You&#039;re supposed to get it inserted earlier. Anyway, insertion didn&#039;t hurt but my arm was pretty sore after. My first period came on time and was the normal 7 days. I was used to 5 days because I was on the pill prior but still 7 wasn&#039;t terrible. The next month I didn&#039;t have a period I was super excited. I thought that meant I wouldn&#039;t have it from then on out. I was wrong. I got it monthly until about 5 months ago. It went from 7 days to 9 days. It got super heavy and unpredictable. I&#039;d have it for 9 days then get it again a week later. Then it started lasting 10-15 days. I was moody and crying. I had it taken out.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""For me, Contrave was my last chance before surgery. I started out a 300lbs, and yesterday I weighed in at 249! The first month the nausea was awful. I was almost ready to give up when I found someone that suggested Dramamine. I take one Dramamine every morning and the full 4 pill dosage of Contrave with no more nausea.  Other side effects for me have been almost constant constipation and very light sleep. One thing I want to make very clear is that Contrave doesn&#039;t make you lose weight by itself. It gets your mind in a place where you can do it yourself. It puts you in control, instead of the cravings. I have lost 50lbs, and I thank Contrave, but I still worked my ass off to get here! """,2
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m in my second week and since I have upped the dosage I have noticed constipation and for the last day moderate abdominal pain and diarrhea. I definitely don&#039;t eat near as much as what I used to And I am very happy about that. I did have headaches the first week nothing that Motrin couldn&#039;t take care of. I am 5&#039;5&quot; I weighed in at 230 pounds and I have lost 5 pounds as of the first week not sure today.  I am very concerned about the possible side effect of cancer in the thyroid since I do have Hashimoto&#039;s disease. But I was considering the gastric sleeve surgery before this medication and really want to give it a shot because I don&#039;t want a large portion of my stomach taken out. I&#039;ll check in and update you all.""",3
Dapsone,Acne,"""I had been suffering from acne since puberty that progressively got worse as I aged. After trying every product on the shelves and still having no relief from the very painful acne around my chin. My dermatologist recommended this product and my skin has never been better. I will admit it took 3-6 weeks before I really noticed any changes but sticking to this product has not only treated all of my acne it also helped with the scarring. I have even stopped wearing foundation all together and receive many compliments on my complexion. My regimen is to wash and moisturize my face twice daily and apply the product nightly.""",4
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking Seroquel about four years ago.  I was a severe alcoholic at the time.  I was once up to 900 mg daily.  I quit drinking over a year ago.  I switched to a new medication because of weight gain.  Latuda did nothing for me.  In addition once I was completely off Seroquel my anxiety and insomnia went through the roof.  It was so severe that my doctor put me back on Seroquel.

 I have been diagnosed with bipolar type II, generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD.  My doctor started seeing me every two weeks, and we were finally able to find my &quot;magic dose&quot; which is 200mg at bedtime.  He also added lithium.
I am very pleased with Seroquel.  I know that many people can&#039;t tolerate it because it is a hard drug, but for me it works great""",6
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I tried the Naxplonon out for a year, mostly to see if things would eventually even out. At first I was getting a period every other month. The flow was heavy, the cramps were harsher then normal, and would last an entire week. During my time on it I didn&#039;t experience any unusual weight gain or loss, my acne remained the same, I wasn&#039;t emotionally crazy. I began to spot between cycles and the longer I stayed on it, the more the spotting progressed until I was getting a period about every other week. Intense PMS symptoms like I never experienced before, cramps that would render me useless, and just general fatigue and moodiness for an entire week, every other week. If heavy hormonal regimens effect you terribly, this may not be your method""",8
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2005 and tried a variety of things, none of which worked, and actually some of them had bad side effects (Seroquel, for example).  I tried Lamictal as a last-ditch effort, but was apprehensive due to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome issue but that didn&#039;t happen to me.  I&#039;m now on 350mg of the drug since then and although I can say it has treated my depression, it has not worked all that well for controlling bipolar symptoms, mainly the buying sprees and bad on the spot decision making (thinking nothing can harm me).  I have been seeing commercials on tv for Latuda and so I might ask my doctor about that.  Also there are some other side effects of the Lamictal that aren&#039;t pleasant ...""",6
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""After battling insurance to finally cover this med, I can&#039;t say the improvements in depression are worth the 1,000 price tag. After trying numerous medications for over 17 years to help with depression, I was really hoping for more. I would say that as an add on to Prozac, it is only somewhat effective. At first I was pleased by the lack of noticeable side effects compared to other antipsychotics. It didn&#039;t make me groggy during the day, nor did I experience any muscle twitches. However, at about the third month on 20 mg, I began getting severe akathesia shortly after ingesting. It manifested with inner restlessness (not normal for me), anxiety, and inability to stop moving. For me, this has gotten so unpleasant that I&#039;ve decided to stop it.""",6
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on Topamax since March 2009. I&#039;ve lost 75 of the 110 pounds I need to lose. The side effects are annoying and, in the beginning I really wanted to quit the medication. But as I&#039;ve lost the weight, I&#039;ve actually been able to decrease the dosage so a lot of the side effects have decreased as well. Some of them are easier to live with than others. The paresthesia has mostly subsided, but I do still struggle with memory lapses. I quit drinking all carbonated beverages because I do not like the way they taste. That has probably helped with the weight loss anyway. Overall, I am quite pleased. I am also pleased to read that others have been able to maintain their weight on this drug.""",2
Saxenda,Obesity,"""My PCP gave me a trial and an RX for Saxenda. I went to fill the script, but, unfortunately, my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it. I can&#039;t pay $800 a month even with the coupon. However, I am using the trial, and absolutely love Saxenda. I have had no side effects, it really helps me with hunger,  helps with cravings , overall, helps me to eat less. I am so sad I cannot continue with this medication for my weight loss, but I definitely recommend this product.""",2
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on Contrave since jan 23rd 2015.  The first month I did not notice a difference in my eating habits but I lost 2 pounds.  I did experience constipation almost every day in the first 3 weeks which gradually dissipated.  As of today I have lost 9 pounds (7 in the last 5 weeks).  I have found that I have lost my urges to overeat and to snack.  I have also noticed that I eat less during meals.  I am not trying to diet.  All of a sudden I just noticed that I am not thinking about food at all.  I have been only eating when I am hungry. (my stomach is literally growling before I think about it).  The one thing that I have been feeling that I am not sure is related to the drug or not is feeling dizzy when I ride the chairlift skiing.""",2
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""Was diagnosed with plasmacytoma in the left mandible and went through radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks.  The radiation did a lot of damage to the inside of my mouth and tongue. I now have an exposed bone in my gum by the molars. I was healing nicely then out of the blue I started having severe pain in my jaw.  It only lasted less than 10 minutes x 10 per day, but it would come on suddenly and was severe. My oncologist said it was probably nerve regeneration causing the nerves to spasm. He prescribed amitriptyline 10mg and said to increase every 3-4 days until I start feeling relief. I am on 30 mg now and no pain at all and yes I have been sleeping great. My mouth was already dry from the radiation so no problem.""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I am a 40 year old male who has been subject to moderate acne my entire life starting at age 13.  It has never been debilitating but it has caused certain self esteem issues (rather it has exacerbated self esteem issues).  In an effort to make this as concise as possible, 99% of all that is on the internet will all the &quot;bad stuff&quot; written about this drugs are NOT true.  Although my experience is one case, my case is a solid and reliable example of the true effects of Amnesteem / Accutane.  The biggest issue with this drug are the insurance companies and the constant monthly battles to get them to cover it.  Remember folks, having insurance is not the same this as having access to proper care and insurance coverage. BEST DRUG EVER!""",4
Bactrim,Acne,"""I have been taking Bactrim for about a year and a half now. Prior to Bactrim I took everything else. I&#039;ve had acne since I was roughly 15 and am now 23. Everything I took either left me feeling crappy, or didn&#039;t work. In my experience taking Bactrim the first 2-3 months my face breaks out horribly. Then at some time in that period it just goes away. It is absolutely the best acne medication I&#039;ve ever taken! I have taken it twice.""",4
Paxil,Depression,"""I was prescribed this medication initially for depression and then along with another medication for atypical depression and panic disorder.  I had to give it some stars because it did help with the anxiety.  Problem was I had no life.  No sex drive.  Emotionally flat.  Slept 12-16 hrs a day (I craved sleep all the time) and ate non stop eventually gaining 80 lbs.  Finally my husband encouraged me to go off it.  I tapered the dose and experienced brain zaps and generally weird feelings for several weeks.  """,5
Kyleena,Birth Control,"""I got mine inserted yesterday. I&rsquo;ve read so many bad things about insertion, but it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It just felt like a really deep cramp, but then it went away. The procedure was done within 5 minutes. Today, I&rsquo;ve been having some cramping, but I&rsquo;m also on my period, so I&rsquo;m not sure if the cramping is due to the IUD or my period. I&rsquo;ve never had a baby before, but I&rsquo;m sure that the pain from getting an IUD placed is nothing compared to giving birth. I would totally recommend!""",8
Topiramate,Obesity,"""My original intent with Topamax was never weight loss, (mood) nor would have I ever believed the results I&#039;ve obtained 19 months later. Quick negatives-my mental agility decreased significantly, I misspell my own name; most food &amp; beverages taste like rubbish; and, the generic version is subpar. I was always overweight, I&#039;m mid-30s, male, &amp; slimmed from 275 to low 180s, size 42 to 32, XXL to L. It stays off! Still drop a few lbs. every month. However it&#039;s impossible for me to get off, I tried once and I went into a severe depression, but I&#039;m a healthy weight now with perfect blood pressure.""",2
Sublimaze,Pain,"""I was given 100 micrograms every hour plus 50 micrograms every 30 minutes as a push button in a drip for cancer pain and it worked great. After the Morphine dose was above 20mg every 4 hours I was given the drip. It worked great for pain and had very little side effects, only constipation but that was because I was on it for 30 days.
I would strongly suggest for any type of severe pain and/or cancer pain if morphine or Dilaudid isn&#039;t working or isn&#039;t tolerable.""",9
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""Started taking Belviq 3 and half months ago, I&#039;ve lost 34 pounds as of today. My obesity is due to emotional eating, eating when not hungry, eating too many calories, greasy junk food, and eating late at night and sometimes in the middle of the night, pigging out to help me sleep. Belviq currently is my holy grail, and I hope to be able to take it the rest of my life, it helps me sleep, and definitely curbs my pigging out. I use Belviq in combination with a FitBit. I count calories watch what I eat, almost completely cut out carbs (except for up to 6 saltine crackers). I have arthritis, I&#039;m 67 and somewhat limited in exercising. If I could lose a lot of weight it would reduce the pressure on my hips and knees. Perhaps then I could walk more.""",2
Sertraline,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Zoloft for 3 weeks (100mg) and it&#039;s done wonders for me.  I was always sad, uninterested in anything, quick tempered, very negative...you get the picture.  Within a week that changed.  I&#039;m able to laugh, I want to do things again; best of all, my sex drive is returning!  My appetite has lessened, but I&#039;m not complaining.  In the first week, I was taking Zoloft by itself; now I&#039;m taking Seroquel XR in the evening in conjunction.  I&#039;m sleeping like a baby the night through (first time in years, really!).  My family and friends are as glad as I am that I&#039;m now on the right track.""",5
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""Following a stroke in June 2014, that Christmas I had become aware of an extremely unpleasant discomfort everywhere but particularly my hands/arms/legs and feet this led to 7 months of tests/scans/x-rays to try and determine what was the cause.
Then finally a neurologist diagnosed central post stroke pain.
The prognoses did not look good, anti-depressives or anti-convulsives where just about all they had to treat this condition, at first I was reluctant especially when I read about the possible side-effects but over time I was beginning to despair.  I  decided to talk to my GP and was put on 10mg of amitriptyline and told to come back later this month (Jan) by that weekend I was sure the tingles/prickly heat were less evident, but I had only been taking them for 3 days surely it%u2019s too soon (I had read to give it 2-6 weeks before I could expect any beneficial change).
I have now been on them for 1 week and to my amazement they are working,  so from a 7/10 and slowly creeping up it is now a 5/10 and feeling a little better every day, all this in the space of just a week.
For me Amitriptyline has saved my life, I was sinking and in despair and was seriously thinking I could not go on with this chronic pain day after day.
How I wished I%u2019d tried this medication earlier instead of being influenced by so many negative reports because for me Amitriptyline is truly miraculous, I feel like putting the empty box in my bedroom surrounding it with candles and flowers and on my knees worshiping it.
If you are reluctant about taking it for neurological pain especially central pain following stroke please don%u2019t be, try it you have nothing to lose except pain.

Time for new dr. and this one told me to try this propranolol.  He gave me a real light dose of 20 miligrams and since I have high blood pressure anyways I decided to give it a try but really did not think it would help.

My face is covered in huge red sore bumps and I have scarring everywhere. I wake up with at least three new pimples a day. I am about to give up on this stuff because it has made my skin 10 times worse than it ever was.

I started what I thought was my period that lasted for 2 weeks, spotted again, and then the cycle started again. It got really annoying when I could never predict when or how bad the bleeding would be. This went on for over 3 months, the day I got it removed, the bleeding stopped immediately. The removal was bad too, my doctor had a hard time getting it out because it had &quot;scarred in&quot;. I&#039;m on the pill now and MUCH happier!""",8

He is constantly twitching his arms, neck and head without knowing he is doing it. Also he has started making vocal noises (random humming) without noticing he is doing it.  I was really hoping the Invega would work but I think in our case the side effects are too much to accept so he will be switching again today.""",6
Vicodin,Pain,"""I am in my 40&#039;s and have got Frozen Shoulder in my left shoulder.  My doctor prescribed Vicodin 5-500mg and it takes the edge off the pain. After the the first prescription of 30 pill were gone I requested a refill my doctor said he would only refill that bottle once more and that is it.  Stating that I would have to endure the pain.  He did not want me to become addicted.  Well I appreciate the concern, but what about my pain? My pills have not run out yet but when they do there will a constant pain. It affects my happiness, work, etc.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking the pills on Labor Day weighing 234 lbs, and weighed myself on 9/13/15 weighing 228.8lbs. I&#039;m very excited about this even though it is a small loss. As far as side effects go, I&#039;ve experienced slight headaches in the temple areas but they don&#039;t linger, this morning (9/14/15) I had extremely dry mouth but it was cured with water, I always have a burst of energy when I take it yet i&#039;m still able to take a nap before work while on the medication. I also take a multivitamin at bedtime, and a B-12 vitamin in the morning with my pill.""",3
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I changed doctors yesterday because my doctor has gotten older and forgetful. My new Doc is 30ish and a woman. I have had sleeping problems most of my life. I am 56. Two years ago my insomnia got so bad I was going 4 and 5 nights with no sleep. Old Doc had me on as many as 4 sleep medicines at one time.  Finally I worked out by problem by taking 3 mg Melatonin about 8:00  taking a hot bath, laying in bed watching boring TV, 9:00 taking 3 Valerian root supplements, just as I was going to bed taking 1 1/2 mg Xanax and 2 Tylenol simply sleep. Worked great. Now, new Doc says she will not give me Xanax, said it causes short term memory loss. She said to take 1, 2 or three 50 mg trazadone. I did last night and laid in bed all night trying to sleep.""",0
Emsam,Depression,"""I have tried what feels like every medicine available for the past 10 years, and this is the first time that I feel like I enjoy life for long periods of time. Sure, with severe depression/anxiety, you will always have down days, but since taking this medicine, they have become less, and the depressed feeling doesn&#039;t last as long. I&#039;m pretty upbeat now, and sometimes can be very chatty.""",5
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I had this IUD for about 5 months. I experienced the worst cramping of my life with this IUD, at times nearly bringing me to tears. I would have cramping with things like working out and after intercourse, and also at random times. These cramps were completely debilitating. I also continued to have my period every month, as well as spotting. It seemed as though the spotting was starting to get better, but the intense, severe cramping persisted so my GYN agreed that it should be removed. Now I&#039;m trying mini pills. I&#039;m unable to use estrogen containing birth control due to a blood clot while on combo pill.""",8
Aczone,Acne,"""I haven&#039;t seen many people on here comment with using it for over 2 weeks. The first few weeks it worked for me too. Thought it was amazing. I&#039;ve now been using it for 6 months hoping it just needs time. Nope NOTHING. I have mild/moderate acne. I&#039;m 24. I still get cystic acne. Especially on my period. I get whiteheads, ones under my skin, black heads, YOU NAME IT. I still get it. The only time my skin is clear is the week before I get my period. """,4
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got Nexplanon abut a year and a half ago and I can not wait until I get it removed. I get frequent migraines, I am having problems fighting depression and major anxiety. I have acne all over my face, my shoulders, my back, and it&#039;s even started on my stomach area. I have my period for about 3 weeks every month and it&#039;s not just spotting, it is extremely heavy, and I have cramps constantly. My sleeping habits are way out of wack; its either I want to sleep all day or not at all. My appetite has sky rocketed and I feel like I can never get enough to eat and yet I&#039;ve lost a TON of weight since getting it. I have absolutely no sex drive what so ever. I would never in a million years recommend this to anyone. I hope this gave some insight""",8
Bupropion,Depression,"""I just was put back onto Wellbutrin after attempting 3 other antidepressants.  It was only after being off it that I realized how good it worked for me. I was taken off of it because it caused me to have some issues with irritability and according to my family- short tempered.  I was put on Cymbalta, but I enjoy a drink or 2 a day with my wife (Cymbalta and alcohol will destroy your liver- very well documented).  Zoloft made me feel completely despondent, and I felt life was no longer worth living, not to mention made me not even remotely think of sex.  When I was put back on Wellbutrin, I felt like life WAS worth living, and I feel happier and euphoric.  Now I take Lamictal with Wellbutrin 150 mg in the morning.  Avoid the XR- causes insomnia.""",5
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I have tried everything I could to lose weight from pills, to shakes, to teas, to detoxing, to even a lap band, and NONE of it worked. I had hit my all-time high of 230. I went to my fertility doctor and she said I was in bad health to try to have a baby. My cholesterol was high, my blood pressure was high, and to make it worse, I was pre-diabetic. I&#039;ve been on adipex now for a month and a half. I&#039;ve lost 35 lbs, barely exercise, but I&#039;m so full of energy that I&#039;ve completely redone my house, cleaned the garage, and refurbished lots of furniture pieces. I LOVE IT!!! I&#039;ve not had his much energy since I was in my 20s! I do have about 20 more lbs to go and it will be off in no time.""",2
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 16 years old, and I&#039;ve just recently started taking Vyvanse. I just started taking a new pill for my depression. Zoloft, which started helping. But I could notice a HUGE difference with Vyvanse right away. I am much more talkative, been in a better mood, less lazy, and I actually don&#039;t mind cleaning my room every now and then. I used to fight with my boyfriend all the time about things, which I now realize should have been no big deal at all. But now, things have changed. I&#039;m excited for school, even because I want to see if Vyvanse will help me bring up my grades and concentrate better, instead of falling asleep in class. Some side effects I&#039;ve noticed though is not having an appetite, and talking too much.""",1
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been battling insomnia for almost 5 years, mostly sleep maintenance.  I&#039;ve tried every medication under the sun.  Belsomra is the new kid on the block and works very differently than all other &quot;sleep&quot; drugs (via orexin/hypocretin receptor antagonism).  I&#039;ve been following and waiting for this drug&#039;s release for years.  First night at 20mgs, I slept 8 hours without waking once, something I haven&#039;t done in years, but boy, does it  sure cause next day sedation.  Well, tiredness is a better term.  Doesn&#039;t cause a &quot;hangover&quot; effects like other drugs, just a tired feeling is the best way to describe it.  Will try 10 or 15mgs and see if the next day tiredness lessens.""",0
Accutane,Acne,"""I have been struggling with mild to severe acne since middle school. at the end of my senior year I started an accutane plan, 40mg for 6 months.

The beginning symptoms were exactly what I expected. Worsening of acne initially, then extreme dryness, and finally RESULT! My acne was vanishing I couldn&#039;t believe it! I was so excited and had the most confidence in forever.

That all came crashing down when the love of my life and girlfriend of 5 months tried to have sex on our 5 month , which was also valentine&#039;s day. Here we are, both virgins, about make love and I CANNOT GET AN ERECTION. I&#039;ve looked into it a bit and know that the first time can be difficult for a lot of guys. But it just didn&#039;t feel right, so I&#039;m posting a warning.""",4
Fentanyl,Pain,"""I have used the fentanyl patch in times past with very good success for the treatment of severe (7-9) range pain due to spinal injuries and deteriation. From my broad experience over the last ten years, I believe this to be the most effective medication. I got off it during a period of some symptom improvement and have been using methadone and percocet instead. I am now at a point that I am needing to resume the fentanyl. It is a very serious medication and I strongly suggest you don&#039;t use it if you can get along with anything else. More than most others it requires a highly personalized approach to amount and timing of dosage so counsel with your pharmacist and doctor. Do NOT try to get off of this med without your Dr&#039;s help.""",9
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed 15mg tablets to take one at night for sleep (or Doctor said 7.5mg was fine). I suffered from Anxiety (No Severe Phobias; more Obsessive Compulsive Disorder type personality), and Depression. This medicine affects your sleep feeling natural, not zombied. I sleep longer, it works better than heavy sedation medicines without being groggy, and I get through all the proper stages of sleep (I&#039;d assume), as it has helped my depression MAJORLY &amp; anxiety sufficient enough. I use to take Seroquel (for bedtime sleep 100mg), it zombies you and is long term very bad for your health. I tried about every SSRI &amp; SNRI, and none seemed to help &amp; only cause problems. I haven&#039;t felt this good in 8 years. Felt better immediately &amp; GREAT after 2 weeks! Hope it helps you.""",0
Pristiq,Depression,"""Prescribed 50mg daily, First week I suffered insomnia so bad I had to get temazepam to sleep, after it settled I basically compared it to taking ecstasy without a comedown, be up listening to music, the flowers seemed to be more colourful, lost 10kilos (the 10 O put on when on another antidepressants mirtazapam i think it was) but yes pristiq was life changing, I do worry that being stimulated like an amphetamine, dilated pupils, smiling for no particular reason, confident will probably take years off my life at that rate, stopped taking after 12 months them to see how I&#039;d go, second week clean, so irritable, angry, spiteful and nasty, just putrid mental state so started taking them again, and same thing seveer insomnia but worth it imo""",5
Methadone,Pain,"""I was Started on Vicodin, 6x a day, in 2003 for a traumatic lower spinal injury, that never healed properly.  Over the next 4 years I ended up taking 2-3 Norco 6x a day, and that wasn&#039;t cutting it. I started suffering from Radiculopathy which is debilitating, and ended up seeing my Pain Management Specialist once a week, getting 120 Norco, and 30 100mg MS Contin&#039;s, each visit, and having to go twice a week because the medicines weren&#039;t helping, for injections of Dilaudid 12mg IM.. After another 3 years passed, and my My Doctor began to worry about my Acetaminophen intake, He decided to put me on Methadone, 25mg 3x a day, and it saved me. I have breakthrough pain, but Norco helps to where I am Pain free 90% of the time!""",9
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I am 21, 5ft .5in female and I got to my heaviest point, weighing in at 155.2. I have never been more than 130. I tried weight watchers and I worked out for about 45-1hr every day and nothing was helping...anyway, I went to my dr and he said he felt I reached a plateau, where it was very hard for me to lose the weight. I was proscribed Adipex tablets on 11/17/15 and today, 12/1/15, I am down 11.2lbs. That is 11.2lbs in exactly 2 weeks!! After losing about 5lbs I felt so much better already. I have not had any horrible side effects. I have dry mouth if I don&#039;t drink much and I barely ever eat anything. I have to force myself to eat. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about it. I definitely would recommend it! Will update in 2 weeks!""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have used Phentermine after both of my babies to lose the baby weight. The first time I lost 30 pounds in 5 months. This time it has only been 8 days and I&#039;ve already lost 11 pounds! I have never experienced any negative side effects, I am thirsty and drink a ton of water, I have zero appetite so I have to force myself to eat, but I also feel energized, focused and extremely happy while on Phentermine. I always recommend this to my mommy friends who want to lose their baby weight as well.""",3
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been taking Saphris for four days now, and I&#039;m not sure what I think yet. I&#039;m still having major anxiety at night, and it&#039;s not helping that much at all.  Also feel sedated when I take it in the morning, so it&#039;s difficult to care for my two year old. Hopefully this will wear off as my body adjusts to the medication.  I have been eating more, which I&#039;m not happy about, since I just lost a lot of weight. I wish my doctor would put me on something for the anxiety, then maybe it wouldn&#039;t be so bad.  """,6
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""This medication is worse than useless. It actually seemed to keep me awake and caused me to wake more often during the night than I normally would. 
After the third night I tried taking it with a xanax (the xanax would normally be enough to help me get to sleep) and it still kept me awake! I&#039;m glad I got this medication as a sample because I would be really angry if I&#039;d had to pay for it.""",0
Morphine,Pain,"""I broke my back in 2000 and I&#039;ve had several compression fractures since then and now have developed osteophytes, I was in pain every day and couldn&#039;t work, so ended up on disability. I recently started Morphine ER and it has worked wonders, and I no longer need to take 8-12 pills a day like I used to, It&#039;s been a God send. I can get around much better and am relatively pain free. I don&#039;t get drowsy or dizzy, in fact I don&#039;t seem to have any side effects. My quality of life has improved significantly since I started this new medication. Thank goodness my Doctor decided to try this, I will admit, after dealing with this for so long I had lost hope it would get any better. I wish I had known about this years ago, better late than never.""",9
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""This product is the real deal. I lost 20 pounds in 1 month. The first week I felt weird, like I was high. The energy is great.I never exercised because I was over whelmed with my job &amp; school. And I ate what I wanted to. I only drink lots of water and sometimes with Crystal Light, no sweets. Everyone wants to know what I am doing. I recommend this to everyone that needs a boost to drop the pounds. I started 188, today I&#039;m 162. That&#039;s a lost of 26 pounds in 5 weeks. Next week I will start exercising.""",3
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had a very strange experience with this medication. I&#039;ve been suffering from chronic insomnia for a couple of years now - I&#039;ve been prescribed every sleeping aid under the sun. Having had bad experiences with most tablets - Zopiclone (evil stuff - always feel irritable and miserable after taking it), Trazadone (spaced out, constipated with a really dry mouth!), antihistamines (don&#039;t work at all), Zolpidem (fall asleep for 2 hours, wake up and can&#039;t go back to sleep) Anyway, you get the picture! When I take Mirtazapine (7.5mg) I fall asleep roughly 30 mins later and sleep for a solid 9 hours! Sounds good....however, the next day I feel SO weird...detached from reality to the point where I can&#039;t function on any level :-(""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been taking phentermine 37.5 for a while now, since June 7, it is now July 20 and I have only lost 8 pounds. I don&#039;t have an appetite at all, I have to force myself to eat, I think it&#039;s only like 1000 calories a day if that. I have really bad heart burn and have some insomnia, other than that I haven&#039;t experienced anything else. I am 5&#039;6 and started off weighing 180, I&#039;m down to 172. 
I did have an episode of jitters, tingly arms, rapid heartbeat, and cold sweats but I ate an apple and I felt much better.
I&#039;m not sure if the pill is actually helping me lose weight, since I&#039;ve been on it for 44 days and have only lost 8 pounds.""",3
Vraylar,Bipolar Disorde,"""So I have been on almost every anti-psychotic out there. So now my pdoc put me on Vraylar. I was going through a bad mixed episode, severe depression, not leaving the house, racing thoughts, etc. The Vraylar has helped with all of that. My pdoc started me at 1.5mg for 2 days then upped it to 3mg. The depression got better almost immediately but now I&#039;m having extreme anxiety- can&#039;t stop moving my leg. So he increased it yesterday to 4.5mg &amp; so far no change in the anxiety but its only been 1 day. I&#039;m just hoping the anxiety is due to the episode &amp; not a side effect of this med. Altho now I&#039;m feeling a tad manic. Also, sleep has been an issue. It makes me sleepy but I sleep restlestless &amp; wake up at 7am, but I&#039;m wide and rested so its ok.""",6
Nuvigil,Bipolar Disorde,"""It&#039;s been a rough 29 years discovering, living with and losing things because of bipolar, ADHD,and OCD!  Tried literally every medicine under the sun, (ours and prob a couple other solar systems too.). So many my doc looked me in my eye and told me that I might &quot;just have to learn how to live&quot; with my head, mind, thoughts, and lack of actions, or intestinal fortitude as your father calls it, he&#039;s Air Force retired after 22 yrs. Suicidal thoughts all the time.  Given all my possessions away.  Stood on the bridge, the roof, and had the gun in my hand, but I always held on, cause I knew their was something like NUVIGIL out there somewhere, I just had to hang on long enough.  If not for NUVIGIL I wouldn&#039;t have been able to focus long enough to write this!""",6
Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,"""I started this contraceptive at 16 to control my acne and it did a great job. I had no problems, I did experience a lack of hunger it was kinda weird but it didn&#039;t effect my life. I just had to make myself eat. Now that I am 18 I have no side effects at all . I haven&#039;t really put it to the test in preventing pregnancy but I&#039;m not pregnant and haven&#039;t been so that&#039;s also a plus.""",8
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Started phentermine 37.5 on Feb 3, 2015 at 272lbs.  Currently at 258 lbs.  It was really exciting at first because I lost about 8lbs in one week.  Then I gained back 2lbs. (No reason, just did.)  Since then I have lost 0 to 2lbs a week.  I definitely feel that I am able to control my cravings and have some self control.  I love that!  What I did not love was the insomnia.  It was so awful that my Dr. presribed Ambien.  I am feeling much better with some solid sleep. I cannot express how much I hate using a drug to counteract a different drug.  I want to continue with the phen, I feel as if it is helping.  Hate that I have to pay a Dr. visit copay every month to get the prescription though.  Doubles the cost of the phen.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking Phentermine only for 3 days now.  The first day I took the medication I had some dizziness. After the first day some dry mouth and very little loss of appetite. I do drink about a gallon of water per/day sometimes more and my workouts are excellent &quot;I like to sweat profusely when working out&quot; with this pill I see a good workout. I don&#039;t know how much I&#039;ve lost because I only like to weigh myself every two weeks. When I started I weighed 208lbs. My goal weight is 180 lbs, but the Doctor says she would like me to loose at least 40 lbs. I can&#039;t wait to see the weight start falling off. I&#039;m having some slight doubts about this pill. I still crave some sweets but not much. And I do sleep very good. """,3
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I take Seroquel 200mg every night and it makes me want lots of cookies and donuts no lies. I love sweets now where before I hated sweets.  My room-mate eats 100 mg and has to eat cookies and cereal as well.  We are both fat thanks to Seroquel. At least I sleep by myself otherwise I would be kicking someone all night long, due to my crazy legs.  Also have very vivid dreams.  I wake up not knowing if I have hurt someone or done drugs.""",0
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Adipex on 3/21/12. My starting weight was 271.5. Today is 4/25/12 and I weigh 258lbs. I&#039;ve lost a total of 13.5 lbs. I&#039;m certain I could&#039;ve lost WAY more. After over a month, I still have 1/2 a bottle left. The side effects of the pill (rapid heart beat, dizziness from not eating..etc) brought out my pre-existing anxiety issues. I stopped taking it for 2 weeks and got back to eating wrong but I started again a little over a week ago and I&#039;m losing like CRAZY! I weigh everyday and the number keeps getting smaller (side effects are GONE). I sometimes skip a pill, but I still don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m starving like I used to. Will continue to take it until I reach 145lbs. I haven&#039;t exercised, but I did purchase the INSANITY workout and will start soon.""",3
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Lamictal 400mg for 7 years.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago this year and prior to Lamictal had been on many different drugs with negative results.  I was very discouraged, thinking life could never as it was prior to bipolar entering my life - but then started on Lamictal and along with Wellbutrin and have not had to change medicines since.  Occasionally, I do add Topamax to it during the winter months for low moods.  Other than that - life is good!""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My son was on Vyvanse for 3 years. At first the side effects were the normal irritability, obsessive thoughts and anxiety only on the days he took the drug. His concentration and grades improved so the benefits outweighed the side effects. The last year though he was increasingly negative, obsessing over negative thoughts, anxious and paranoid only on the days he took it. I think the side effects can affect kids more or less as they grow. He was very depressed for a 10 year old. Since he&#039;s been off he&#039;s been happier!! I think positive thoughts are more important than grades since we all know where negative thoughts leads to down the road if left unchecked. Overall the medicine is not bad but keep a close eye on behavior.""",1
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Been one week and down 7lbs... I have a slight headache but not sure if it is because my desire for diet coke (reducing caffeine intake) and food has reduced greatly!  Headaches relieved by ibuprofen. Sometimes I look at the clock and its 1-2 hours after normal meal time!  I used to be the first (or second) person at our work cafe for every meal!  I will repost after a month.   Love the results so far.  I have willpower and not so food obsessed!""",3
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I got the Mirena two months ago. It hurt a little when the doctor put it in, and I cramped for about a day afterwards. I had no discomfort after that until I got my period a month later. My period was 2 1/2 weeks long (which has never happened in my life) with weird discharge and a lot of cramping. The main issue I&#039;ve had with the Mirena is a lot of cramping and brown slimy discharge. I&#039;m hoping it gets better, my Doc says to give it some time.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have only been taking Contrave for 3 weeks. I have felt a little nauseous occasionally. The worst side effect is insominia. I started at 241lbs and after 3 weeks 233lbs. I feel happy, like I could take on the world. Perhaps the antidepressant is responsible. Certainly not like past diet pills that make you hyper and nervous. I really think this drug is a miracle so far. I make better eating choices and don&#039;t eat as much. I attribute this to not having cravings and not really caring that much about a meal any longer. Wish my insurance would cover it but it&#039;s well worth the price so far.""",2
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""So I got this implant 08/2015 and the first 4 months my periods were normal and first 2 months I had a few mood swings. After the 3rd month everything seemed normal for about 3 more months. No weight gain, or mood swings or anything but now it got pretty bad. I went without a period for two months but now that it&#039;s back I get it every 2 weeks. I saw my dr yesterday 7/272016 and said that it is thinning out my lining so maybe that&#039;s why I am having my period more often. She prescribed some estrogen to see if it balances everything out and if not then I will need to take it out.""",8
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I can&#039;t believe how much this medicine helps.  Something tramatic happened to me last May which made me very anxious and my doctor tried to prescribe this but my insurance company is notorious for turning down any medicine that does not have a generic.

Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Today is my 2nd day taking this pill.  I have had dry mouth and was unable to sleep throughout the whole night last night.  I do not feel energy at all, in fact, since I didn&#039;t sleep, I didn&#039;t even want to get out of bed today.  I&#039;ve had a bad headache today, and feel a bit nauseated too.  I&#039;m going to keep trying it, but just wanted to go over some side effects after my 1st day on it.  I hope to lose weight though""",3
Bupropion,Depression,"""Before starting bupropion I was almost incapable of getting out of bed, I had lost all desire to do anything, and felt so hopeless. Over the course of a few months I started taking firth 150mg then 200mg and it has made such a significant difference. I have energy and am more motivated than I have been in so long. Taking bupropion has also helped me regain my libido, the loss of which was one of the most troubling symptoms of depression for me.""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I am 40 years old, have never had any kids and have had Mirena for 10 months now. Insertion was uncomfortable but not painful.  Cramping after wards was only slightly more than past period cramping.  Periods are now light spotting but almost non-existent. I was a moody person before but do not feel as if I am even more so now.  I did not experience the acne and lost my job last year so contributed to the weight gain since not being as active. I wanted to try this birth control since I am an on/off again smoker and do not plan to have any children. I would recommend it to women to try and see how their body reacts to it. Other reviews helpful especially the ultrasound tip before re-insertion.""",8
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal has been working pretty good so far.  My only complaint is lately depression is creeping up on me, but this could be just part of the &quot;winter blues.&quot;  On Lamictal, I am not emotionless; it just helps with the dramatic mood swings (I have Bipolar type 1).  I was given Lamictal as an option due to the fact that I requested a medicine that will not make me gain weight.  As I was told, I do notice Lamictal seems to be weight-neutral, which is a good thing.  I haven&#039;t been on Lamictal more than a few months yet, but I am hoping it continues doing its job.""",6
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I started Belviq 3.5 weeks ago. I tried sorting through reviews just like you are, to see if the $85 a mo. after coupon was worth it. I found it difficult because too many reviewers left out their gender, weight &amp; height so I just decided to just try it.  With that being said, I&#039;m a 5&#039;1 female with a desk job weighing 163 to start. I now weight 157. This medication suppresses my appetite slightly, but it suppresses my cravings a lot &amp; I don&#039;t give like before. The first day I thought I wasted $85 because the headache was awful. It subsided the next day. I do feel sleepier at night, so I haven&#039;t worked out at all, I&#039;m going to purchase another month &amp; add  Exercise. I&#039;m also on a 1200 cal diet that I track on my fitness pal""",3
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""The first day I took this I immediately got a mild headache, this headache lasted the whole time I took it. I have been on it for a week and stopped today. My heart beats hard, I have headaches, acid reflux, body aches, and weight gain. I am thinking maybe it raises my BP instead of lowering it and causing me to hold water. I have been the same weight on an extremely low carb diet which is not normal for me. Works for many, but not me.""",3
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I took Cymbalta (20mg twice per day) for about a year. The drug worked better than any other AD I tried. Around 10 months ago, I wanted to see if I could come off the drug to see how I would do. I suffered from anxiety and mild depression. Once the drug was weaned out of my system, I haven&#039;t felt quite right. My doctor agreed for me to start taking it again. After three weeks, I have a much better state of mind with decreased anxiety. I really like this medication and have no side effects!""",7
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I had the IUD insterted in March 2015. My doctor had me wait until I was on my period so that my cervix would be &quot;spongier&quot; and wouldn&#039;t hurt less. Unfortunately for me, because I had been on birth control for 4 years prior, I was having an extremely light period. Easily the most painful experience of my life. Was doing all I could NOT to scream in the examination room during the procedure. After the procedure I had to lay there for a while before being able to get up and leave.  The pain lasted the entire day. Very sharp throbbing pain. I aImost threw up twice. After a few days I was fine. My next period was very painful, but got lighter as time went on. I&#039;m very happy with this IUD, I&#039;m not sure if I will replace it though due to the pain""",8
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD late and started Strattera about a year ago. When one gets a diagnosis like this late in life, one contemplates missed opportunities along the way, so I was very hopeful at the beginning. My insurance balked, because it was only approved for children, but eventually, I started it. A year later, I stopped. I don&#039;t know what the reasons are, but I felt no effects whatsoever. I stopped about a month ago, and never even noticed anything since stopping. I know doctors don&#039;t want to prescribe amphetamines or opiates or anything which has even the slightest risk of dependency. Fine. Then what? And what is out there for adults with ADHD?""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I started taking this medicine about 2 years ago now. I am on the 40 mg dose and at first everything was great, my grades improved, I could focus in public. But now, my loss of appetite is crazy. I&#039;m 13 and I only weigh 82 lbs. I become very short tempered with my friends and I get annoyed at the littlest things. It also brings my mood way down. When I&#039;m on my medicine I feel depressed and anxious constantly. I still get my a&#039;s and b&#039;s in school but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth all the side affects.""",1
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I haven&#039;t seen a xanax in the US from a US pharmacy with the name brand xanax scored on the pill in over 20 years. these had no taste. Real xanax have a very distinct taste. and it never melted in my mouth. xanax always melt in my mouth within a few minutes. I&#039;ve seen videos on youtube of people pressing them. My advice is. Get a prescription from a doctor and get them from the pharmacy because that wasn&#039;t the first time I saw these.. The streets are flooded with these  bars.""",7
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Belviq for 21 days and have lost 20lbs. I was fortunate not to experience any side effects. My constant urge to eat was subsided almost immediately. I find that I have to make myself eat most days. I have lost 14 inches total so far and can&#039;t wait to see how much more I lose. This medicine has been a blessing for me. Go to the DR this week for my first checkup and am actually looking forward to getting on the scale!""",3
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I am on gabapentin for anxiety 300mg 3x a day I feel great I was on 100mg 3x a day for 2yrs and they just upped it. I feel good again I just get over the tired feeling again but I would tell anyone who try this med works wonders. I didnt know how good was til he upped it I was a mess I couldn&#039;t even make work. I&#039;m off next couple weeks so med can adjust but been a week and already feel alot better""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started Contrave last month. Took one pill and had extreme side effects the first day. I was extremely dizzy, nauseous, tired and had a headache I wasn&#039;t able to shake for a few days. I didn&#039;t continue taking the pill because I had a busy week with work and was afraid I&#039;d continue feeling like that. I restarted Contrave last Monday and just finished my first full week and am down 4lbs. I had barely any side affects the second time around besides feeling really tired by the middle of the day. It has cut my appetite in half and eliminated a lot of cravings. Hoping for even better results now starting week 2 and pills 2x a day.""",2
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""Effexor Saved Me After Many Failed Medicines.  

Current Med Combo- Effexor 75 mg, Lamictal 200 mg, Abilify 5 mg

It saved me from wasting anymore time locked up in my house 24/7 and avoiding conversations, knocks at the door, people, telephone calls, and anything else involving socializing. 

I FINALLY LEAVE MY HOUSE. WILLINGLY and REGULARLY. Daily.  I NO LONGER FEAR APPLYING FOR JOBS. I NO LONGER FEAR THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A JOB because I would have to deal with people. I am willing and eager to go out with friends, family, acquaintances, meet new people. 

SIDE EFFECTS- Only Nightmares, which eventually become less and less and then go away after 2 months. Maybe a little unpleasant at first. Definitely bearable.

It&#039;s not bad for everyone.""",7
L-methylfolate,Depression,"""I have had treatment-resistant depression for 20 years and have tried Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor, Paxil, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Viibryd.  Lexapro (20 mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg XL) seem to work best but even with talk therapy, good diet and exercise I still have never achieved full remission.  After my psych doctor retired, I switched to another who had me tested for MTHFR mutations and started me on 15mg of Deplin. Within 7 days I felt better than I could ever remember - it was like a light switch!  Test results showed I am homozygous for the C677T MTHFR mutation.  I stopped taking Deplin after some agitation &amp; anxiety started; I restarted on a lower dose before ramping up to 15 again.  I have yet to see the same improvement after 3 weeks.""",5
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I suffered with severe anxiety, especially in social situations. I think mine was linked to coming off my pill and my hormones going crazy. I tried sertraline for two days and felt horrid - flu like symptoms, depression, nausea, fatigue! I then tried venlafaxine and after two weeks my anxiety had gone. It came back around the time of the month but this medicine has truly fixed me. I understand that different medicines work for different people but this saved my life.""",7
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I took Cantrave for five months under a physician monitored program.  After three months there were no noticeable effects of the drug.   I started to regain the weight for two months while on the drug.  I went off the drug and five months later I am back where I started and several hundred dollars out of pocket.  My physician told me it was good for long-term use, but that did not prove the case for me.  It was not effective after ninety days.""",3
Apri,Birth Control,"""I was on cyclessa no problems, until my Dr. Switched me saying that they no longer carry it. April is awful I&#039;m breaking out like a middle school boy and I&#039;m itchy all the time. Just want to know how many people had the same symptoms because my doctor is telling me in order to switch b.c. I have to completely buy a new prescription because breaking out and being itchy &quot;are not side effects&quot;.""",8
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""Seroquel worked for me during my rapid cycling last year and really chilled me out very quickly. Only bad thing to say about it is I found the level of sedation far too much, and it left me incredibly &quot;plastic&quot; the next day. Was a bit like a walking zombie, although it got me through the dangerous bit. Also meant as I have great trouble sleeping it helped that side out too, so all in all was very good for me. Came off all medicines 9 months ago. Now only on zopiclone for sleeping. So hopefully no matter how good it is, wont be back on it!""",6
Strattera,ADHD,"""36 year old female diagnosed last year. I did not want medication, but fearing I&#039;d lose my job from symptoms, talked to my doctor and gave Strattera a try. Been on it a month. Can see major improvements in concentration, getting things done, not jumping from one thing to another constantly. I&#039;m also a calmer, less anxious version of myself, more patient mother. Things don&#039;t seem to bother me as much! My head is quiet. For side effects the first 2 days were bad - chills, tingling/current sensation on my scalp, upper back and neck and numb arms, drowsy. My doctor told me not to quit, so glad I did! No constipation or trouble urinating. Still get occasional chills and scalp tingling, low appetite (good cause I was overeating!). Hope it lasts!""",1
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""I have had chronic lower back pain/degenerative disc disease for over 25 years, along with an L5 S1 diskectomy, my pain and my condition continue to get worse with time. In the past I have been on Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Fentanyl, and just most recently, Oxycontin 30 mg time release, did not like them at all. Even more recently I was prescribed Hysingla 80mg time release. I have been taking it for two days now and I am amazed at how I feel when I wake up! No pain, and slight withdraw, at which point I take a 10 mg oxycodone for breakthrough pain. It&#039;s been forever since I have woken up happy. Don&#039;t notice any side effects yet, can say, that it certainly does not last he 24 hrs.... more like 12-14, and takes a few hours to start working...""",9
Vilazodone,Depression,"""Went to my PCP for an increase in Effexor as was not doing well at all.  Have had several terrible things happen in the last year and was actually feeling &quot;crazy&quot; suicidal.  Also found that I developed diabetes.  My physician said there had been a lot of success with Viibryd and gave me samples.  I have only been on the medication for 4 days at this time but can already tell such a difference in my life.  I am sleeping better, a little drowsy in the morning but that was happening already.  At the same time I started Metformin so the loose stools could be from either medication.  I can live with those since I am doing so much better.  In order to stop the Effexor, I am taking it every other day for one full week. """,5
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Hi all, I left my opinion last year around October. And things have changed just a bit. I understood my illness is genetic Bc my uncle had it and my dad has it but don&#039;t accept it I guess. Anyway 70% of cases have a genetic background so feel better about that. You didn&#039;t chose this. I feel Lamictal is not working as well after two years but not a major change. I will increase it from 200mg to 250 this week. I control my depression with clonazepan. I feel anxiety makes depression worse. So when it kicks in then I feel stronger enough to make a prayer and it goes away.we need to do some work in our brain. Everything that is negative you change it for &quot;yes&quot; and I can and I will.""",6
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I actually posted on here awhile back when I first started taking Lexapro. I have now been on 10 mg/day for four months. It definitely has cured my depression and irritability, but I always feel fatigued and I can&#039;t seem to lose the belly fat I acquired since being on Lexapro. My doctor insists this doesnot affect your metabolism or cause weight gain, BUT I am eating less (and better) than ever before, and exercising, and I can&#039;t lose any weight, where before, I could lose it pretty quickly with diet and exercise. I guess I&#039;m not really sure if it&#039;s the Lexapro or not, but I do feel tired and bloated all the time. I am a really small person (4&#039;11&quot;) and the belly fat really shows. Not sure what to do.""",5
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I am a 52 yr old female weighing 160 pounds.  I started the low dose 14 day trial about 2 months ago.  I lost 2 lbs. immediately.  Side effects were, loss of appetite &amp; constipation.  When I started the higher, 7.5 dose, my digestive system instantly shut down.  I took a stool softener &amp; laxative daily &amp; I still could not go to the restroom.  I drink 70-85 oz. of water &amp; take &quot;It Works&quot; &quot;greens supplement&quot; daily to get a decent intake of fruits &amp; vegetables.  Long story short, I can only take 1 pill once every 5 to 6 days; otherwise I am miserable and extremely stopped up.  Since getting the prescription filled on May 14, 2016, I have only taken 7 pills.  I have an appt to see my doc in a few days.  Have lost 3 pounds.""",3
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Have been taking Belviq for two and a half months have lost 10 lbs.  First two days had a headache and felt weird, but then it went away and I have noticed I sleep like a rock (albeit I do have weird dreams).  I also have a lot LESS anxiety, so I am unsure what that is about?  I don&#039;t have any other side effects except that I am MUCH less hungry, don&#039;t really think about food like I use to.  It has been so much easier to stay on track and just eating like a normal human.  I feel GREAT and am very grateful to this drug.""",3
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I took Adipex for 1 year and lost 90lbs. I changed my eating habits and starting doing light exercise 3 days a week. I&#039;ve been off Adipex for 3 months and haven&#039;t gained any weight back. Just stick with a healthy eating plan and you will not gain. Medications should be used as a tool if you don&#039;t change your eating habits then you can gain all the weight back. *sidenote...please stop writing reviews when you haven&#039;t taken the medication or just started the medication. The purpose of a review is to give your opinion on a product after using it for some time. Announcing that your doctor has prescribed Adipex isn&#039;t a review and it isn&#039;t helpful for people who are looking for reviews on this website..rant over..""",3
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""In the past 7 days, I&#039;ve lost 4 pounds. I&#039;ve experimented with the dose. One day I forgot to take the pill until 3 PM. I observed that I still had the &quot;not much interest in food&quot; effect. I took a whole pill at 3 PM. For the rest of the week, I took only one pill at 3 PM each day. Afternoons and evenings were the time I was most likely to crave something or overeat. When I came in the door from work (in the past) I felt ravenous. No more. I know the 1/2 life is 11 hours, but I don&#039;t feel this wearing off till about 2 PM the next day. I&#039;m very happy, because this doubles the time the pills last! 4 pounds in a week is  unheard of for me. No more headache or dry mouth either. Reduces desire for food! No sweets/carb cravings. I&#039;m amazed!""",3
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""This is the best medication I&#039;ve taken for a mood stabilizer.  It takes about 3 months to work at peak, but the benefits have been amazing. While some medications seem to drag you to feeling better,  this one just nudges me. I feel as if My Real personality can show through. I&#039;m stable and thinking more rationaly, without losing the ability to feel my emotions. Plus, I lost a few pounds.""",6
Propoxyphene,Pain,"""Darvon was only one of two medicines, which didn&#039;t really help. Sedating but no real pain relief, sort of a distraction from pain. I was being treated for prophylaxis of tuberculosis with Isoniazid (INH), so my options on pain medicines were a bit limited to &quot;nothing with acetaminophen&quot; -which mostly left the strong painkillers - finally MD found some Vicoprofen, which worked well but not &quot;too well&quot;.""",9
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I originally was prescribed 2mg, which stopped working after a few weeks. I then was upped to 3mg which worked like a charm, but then after a month or so, again stopped working. And if my sleep was interrupted it caused me to feel drunk. I still take this, but I take it now at a pill and a half. It&#039;s frustrating that tolerance builds up so quickly, but otherwise it works well if you follow exactly how to take it.""",0
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I feel the need to add my 2 cents here. For YEARS I was unable to live a &#039;normal&#039; life - spending most of the time in bed due to Derkums Disease and severe arthritis. Moving was painful and even the shortest trips left me in tears. I was given Nucynta, Dilaudid, Lortab, just to name a few. Oxycodone was prescribed and it truly changed my life. I am now able to take walks and do light excercise, yard sale and go to church! I do not understand the negative press about this medicine, I have never felt &#039;funny&#039; or different. I just do not hurt like before. I consider this a life-saving wonder medicine!""",9
Kadian,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been on Kadian for 8 months (car accident 3 years ago, suffering from extensive postural and disc and recently diagnosed PTVS symptoms since). I&#039;m 22 and started feeling able to live my life again after taking Kadian (10mg 2 x day) and it seemed to make my mood better. It no longer works at current dose and doctor won&#039;t move up a dose, and doesn&#039;t believe in short-acting medicines. First 6 months it really did wonders and gave me a lot of my life back. Constipation is brutal with this medicine - I take Miralax daily with some relief. Withdrawals are horrific.""",9
Pristiq,Depression,"""It&#039;s an amazing drug. I have started having GAD due to the nature of my job, I had tried several meds and nothing worked for me. Pristiq made a huge difference in my life, where I felt alive again. For people afraid of withdrawal symptoms, I have weaned off Pristiq over a period of 2 months with no issues. Now after 2 months pristiq free , I am scheduling an appointment with my GP to go back on pristiq as stress levels has heightened again. The only side affect I had was lower sex drive which can be stressful, yet manageable. That&#039;s the only reason I have rated it 9""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been on this medication once before and lost interest in it because I was not feeling like I had lost weight. I decided I would try it again. I started it on June 13th weighing 359. I weighed myself on June 19th and had lost an amazing 18lbs. My doctors appointment is Saturday and everyone has noticed a big difference in me. I&#039;ve lost 2 pant sizes, and 1 shirt size. This stuff really does work.""",3
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""No medicine has ever worked for my insomnia besides this one. It keeps my mind from racing, and keeps my emotions steady so I&#039;m able to fall to sleep with no problems. I usually take it an hour before bedtime and then lay down, read a little bit until I&#039;m feeling tired enough, and just close me eyes. Before this medicine I couldn&#039;t tell you the last time that I was able to fall asleep without remembering but now I don&#039;t remember falling asleep and have to worry about hours of tossing and turning. Highly recommend.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I did not think that a pill could help speed along the process of weight loss so much. I have had 4 children and am now 37. losing that weight was not easy like it was when I was younger. My last child was born a year ago and I only lost 10 of the 30 lbs I gained. I am 5&#039;8 and weighed 222 the day I was prescribed Phentermine (January 11, 2013. As of March 7, I weigh 198). 24 lbs in less that 2 months I am HAPPPPPPYYYY! My goal is to be 150lbs. Looks like I will be there soon enough. I drink a lot of water because the only side effect I have is extremely dry mouth. The first night I took it I did have trouble sleeping but not since the first night. I go in to my Dr once a month for a check up, weigh in and new prescription. I highly recommend it!""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Nexplanon for a little over two months now and I absolutely love it.  I was really scared of the side effects after reading tons of reviews, but I decided to go for it and I&#039;m so glad I did! I don&#039;t have to worry about anything for 3 years and it takes a lot of pressure off of me and my partner. I was especially scared about the constant bleeding that a lot of people complained about, but I haven&#039;t run into that problem at all! I was actually supposed to have my period last week, but it never came, so here&#039;s to hoping I don&#039;t have to deal with that for the next three years! 
Definitely consider this--it&#039;s painless and a great and easy way to be responsible about birth control!""",8
Accutane,Acne,"""I have been on accutane for a little over two months now. My acne was terrible before taking this. I had been on everything on the market. In the first few weeks of treatment my skin got worse, but now it is fantastic with few bumps. My skin isn&#039;t very dry, just my lips. I play a lot of sport and experience joint and chest pain in many of my matches. I&#039;d rather experience little physical pain over the emotional and physical pain of having acne.""",4
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""8 years ago I had my 3rd child, a healthy baby girl, and suffered from horrible postpartum depression.  My OBGYN put me on 10 mg Lexapro and after a few more terrible days and a trip to the ER I ended up in a psychiatrist office. He added mirtazapine to help me eat and sleep and in 2 weeks I was much better.  I was able to stop the mirtazapine and took the Lexapro for a full year. I am so grateful to those 2 Dr&#039;s who helped me crawl out off a very dark hole.  A month ago I fell back in and my anxiety kicked into high gear. I was barely functioning.  After 2 weeks my psychologist put me back on 10 Mg Escitalopram.  I am entering my 3rd week and feel much better.  This medicine has been wonderful.  Prayer   medicine   talk therapy.""",7
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I took this med for ADHD with hopes of helping w/anxiety &amp; depression. I had headaches right away and began lying in bed all day long. I wanted this to work so I stuck with it despite constipation, dry mouth/eyes and headaches. My mood was worsened and I had a flat affect. I didn&#039;t laugh for two weeks. It wasn&#039;t until I stopped taking it that I realized how depressed it had made me. Once out of my system, my libido also returned. Drugs change the brain chemistry and for some it works, for others it doesn&#039;t. Straterra is not for me.""",1
Levorphanol,Pain,"""I have peripheral neuropathy &amp; another chronic pain condition. This drug was the only one that has relieved both almost completely. It is very costly if your insurance will not cover. My doctor had knew nothing about it but let me try. I have taken all of the other opiates &amp; this is the only one that worked very well for both issues. I dont understand why it is not more widely prescribed. Grayson""",9
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Belviq for over a year and have been able to finally control what I eat. I was 206 pounds and am now down 164 pounds. I am sorry I did not try it sooner as my overall health has gotten better from cholesterol, blood sugar and sleep. My doctor says I will see my ache knees feel better after another 15 pounds.He says most of his patients are good dieters but bad exercisers for the most part. Just happy to get better health.""",3
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 22 and have not had any kids. I got Mirena inserted 3 weeks ago while I was on my period. The insertion was a bit painful, but manageable. Cramping lasted for about 2 full days (nothing that Advil couldn&#039;t cure). My period almost immediately stopped as soon as it was put in and then a week later I started bleeding again. I have been bleeding since... it&#039;s light, but not light enough to just wear a panty liner. I know several people who have had Mirena and say that this will stop after a month or so. My fiance can feel the strings, says it can be uncomfortable, but not bad. So far so good.""",8
Butrans,Pain,"""I started off on 5mg they had no effect so Gp upped to 10mg. By the second day the pain had reduced substantially and things felt good. I&#039;ve suffered for eight years with sacroiliac pain S1, herniated discs L4/5/6 at base. Just had successful total hip op. However I&#039;ve had to come off them due to the very bad side effects, nausea, crawling itchy feeling under the skin,unable to sit in the sun and if I did suffered greatly, irritability, very low mood, and worst of all hot flushes. I&#039;m back to my old self now. When peps start telling you you&#039;ve changed, it&#039;s no joke and was very relieved to get them out of my system. Having said that, I know they work for some.""",9
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I tried Orlistat years ago but was ignorant towards its use (not controlling fatty foods and having lovely sunset yellow accidents), so gave it up. I have struggled with PCOS (Poly Cystic Ovaries Syndrome) since the age of 17 and one of my symptoms has been WEIGHT. Always been overweight and when I do diet and exercise the hormonal imbalance will make it harder to lose the Ib&#039;s and I gain muscle instead. After two kids its become harder to lose any weight and decided to go back to prescribed Orlistat. 
Now 4 days in, bloated, flatulance, no accidents, looser stools and bloatness goes away after relieving myself. Not weighed myself yet. (2nd day I felt dizziness, but no more). I&#039;m careful with fat consumption and try not to snack in between meals.""",2
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lithium is for Mania.  It is NOT a mood stabilizer.  Lamictal is an awesome mood stabilizer.  Anyway, Lithium has done wonders for me!  I feel calmer on it and not so spacey and think clearer.  The only thing that I do not like is the fear of it damaging my liver and/or kidney&#039;s.  I do blood work every 3 months to get my levels and make sure everything is ok. and he did lower me once because the lithium level had gotten too high.  Also, my hair is thinner and dryer since I started it.  Not fond of that either.""",6
Copper,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had Paragard since middle 2009  and we&#039;re now in middle 2016 so a total of about 7 years. I&#039;m in a serious relationship and have intimate relations a lot and have not gotten pregnant at all. The first 6 months I had internal pain with my body getting used to a foreign object becoming permanently a part of me, but after those months I get my regular monthly cycles (sometimes they are off but that is normal) and my cramps are the same as before I got it inserted. I would recommend""",8
Abilify,Depression,"""I was prescribed 2.5 mg/day Abilify to augment 40 mg/day Celexa (for anxiety) and 150 mg/day Trazadone (for insomnia) in order to address my depression as the other 2 medicines didn&#039;t seem to help. Within a week I did notice an improvement in my mood and motivation. Nothing earth shattering but noticeable. Hoping my doctor will bump me up next time I see him. I have not had any problems so far concerning increased hunger or any other side effects except for the first 4 days or so I did get heartburn and hiccups but these have passed.""",5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed Ambien after suffering a serious bout of insomnia that no OTC sleep aid would touch. I was given 10 MG. The first night I took it, I woke up feeling like I was in heaven. I hadn&#039;t slept that well since I was a kid. I used it for three months, and the only reason I stopped taking it is because the 10 MG dosage eventually &quot;pooped out&quot; on me and my doctor did not want to increase the dose, so he switched me to Lunesta. But it was great while it lasted. I did have some weird hallucinations happen if I took it and stayed up for a while, so make sure you take it and go right to bed. I quit cold turkey to go on Lunesta and had no problems discontinuing it.""",0
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had chronic back and neck pain for over 10 years and drugs like Vicodin, Lorcet and others like them quit working. Was taking MS Contin for 5 years and it started to loose its effect. Started the Dilaudid 2 years ago and still doing well with it. Without it I would have a constant pain level of 8 to 9.5 and unable to do anything. With it my pain level runs 4 to 6 and I&#039;m able to do some things. I&#039;ve been unable to work for 10 years but now can do some wood working with a little lathe.""",9
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on deep depression. Effexor was not working any more and was having deep suicidal thought. Then my doctor added Latuda 40 mg. Miracle! No more suicidal thought and my bipolar depression ceased by 80%. The only problem is make me sleep when I take in the morning and make me awake when I take it at supper. Taking it at lunch causes a little less sleepiness. Another feature is that it control my severe anxiety.""",6
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had severe insomnia for years and have tried everything from diphenhydramine (Benadryl), Ambien, temazapam, and trazodone.

Honestly most of the above work except I have to rotate every few weeks between them.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, the one sleep aid that works the best for me is a strong dose of Benadryl.  I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep and Benadryl is the one tried and true medicine that works all night. Because of other meds I&#039;m now on, I can&#039;t take it any longer and have to take a prescription sleep aid.""",0
Strattera,ADHD,"""I had such high hopes for this med to work out but it simply does not do it for me. I have suffered with ADD my entire life and after being over medicated on anti-depressants, bi-polar meds and anxiety meds my neurologist put me on this. I did not want to take another drug that could possibly become addictive however now that I have been on it for 8 months and get almost no relief I do plan on switching to something different. It may work for some but did not do well for me personally.""",1
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I started taking Ambien about 3 years ago.  When I first took it I did make the random phone calls and would eat in my sleep but it worked.  I only took it when I absolutely needed to.  I stopped for about a year then the insomnia started again and I took it again and the side effects weren&#039;t there.  I still take it every once in a while when I really need it (maybe once a month) and the side effects are still gone. Just sleep and I don&#039;t feel groggy in the morning.""",0
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I was prescribed this after about 7 years of chronic acne on my face, shoulders, chest and back since I was about 11. Every face wash and diet change did nothing to help it. I wish I&#039;d taken doxycycline sooner, it&#039;s absolutely amazing. I started noticing less redness and bad pimples after about three days, and it obliterated the ones that were already there. After 2-3 weeks, I only had a few blackheads and even those were few and far between. Really great stuff. Been using it for 3 months so far.

I&#039;ve had no nasty side effects (apart from dehydration in the morning sometimes) up until today when I forgot to take it with food (oops!) and experienced about 20 minutes of severe stomach pains afterwards.

Overall, brilliant stuff.""",4
Bupropion,Depression,"""It takes about 2 weeks to feel Wellbutrin kick in and about a month for it to be full effect. I am on 300 mg a day and take it in the morning only. If you take it too late it will keep you awake. I am on other med for Bipolar that cause weight gain, but this med seems to be the opposite and has actually helped me lose weight. Sometimes the med &quot;runs out&quot; in the afternoon and you can kind of feel the let down. It works great for depression and would be good if used by itself for weight loss. Would recommend using it, but you have to be patient with it.""",5
Opana ER,Pain,"""I have Trigeminal Neuralgia, which is the &quot;most painful condition known to man&quot;, and Opana ER is the first medication that has ever actually helped with this type pain. It has worked better for me than any other pain medicine and it lasts FAR longer than any other extended release medications I&#039;ve tried. 

Because this works better for me, I am able to take less/lower dose than other medicines- which means I can function at a much higher rate.

Many patients with this condition do not take (narcotic) pain medication because Trigeminal Neuralgia does not usually respond well to them. However, for me, this is the 1st and only medicine that has actually helped with my level of pain and it has allowed me to have a much higher quality of life!""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am 46 years old and 4&#039;11&quot;.  On April 4th I was 165 pounds, borderline diabetic with high blood pressure at my Dr. visit.  He prescribed phentermine which I started taking on April 5th.  Today I had my 2 month visit and I have lost 19.8 pounds total.  My fasting blood sugar was down to 88 and my BP was down also.  Hoping to lose another 8-10 before my appointment in July.  Feeling great!!""",3
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I have been on ativan for 15 years%u2026 started at 1mg and was gradually increased to 4mg. The medication only numbs things the anxiety never went away, and after I started taking I started getting other symptoms like OCD, social anxiety, depression and others 

I should never have trusted the Dr and should have researched the drug before taking. I will never again just take anything without researching it. I am slowly tapering it off, the withdrawals are a nightmare but staying on this medication which should be banned is not an option. This medication was never intended to be prescribed longer then a few weeks. Drs and drugstores are completely to blame right beside the drug companies. They all know it%u2019s poison.""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My current dosage to treat ADHD and depression is 37 mg slow release twice daily, morning and noon.
Although the medicine does not completely relieve my ADD behavior (distraction, sillyness, loud speaking, impulsive acts, lack of sustained focus, poor listening skills) it does permit my mind to focus better and to self regulate my actions. I am also doing therapy and my wife spends a great deal of her considerable intelligence and thoughtfulness to improving my mental health and in consequence, our married life.
The medication certainly helps to motivate for work, meeting and talking with people, and generally feeling a sense of my ability to function.""",1
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&#039;m a 45 yr old female, 5&#039;6&quot; tall, and my starting weight was 220 when I weighed in at the doctor&#039;s office on August 31st. I have some health concerns that lead my doctor to prescribe this for me. My doctor helped to administer the first dose so I would know what to do the next day. 
I felt okay the first 2 days with little side effects. The 3rd day I couldn&#039;t stand the smell of bacon. Who doesn&#039;t like the smell of bacon? This girl now! The 4th day I threw up my morning coffee and meds. I have been experiencing constipation as well. I am currently on 1.2mg and on day 9. I&#039;ve lost 5 lbs so far so I&#039;ll keep dealing with the side effects. I did start to inject at night to help with the nausea. I am very hopeful this medication will do the job!""",2
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had the IUD Mirena for almost a year.  I wanted a no thought birth control and the thought of no periods was very appealing.  However, after the insertion I had the worst cramps ever. They were so intense I was practically bed ridden for the first month and the horrifying pain continued for at least 3 months after.  I was unemployed and thank God for that because I never would have made it through a day.  I have never given birth but I would imagine it was like labor pains...not your typical period cramp...and it was all day every day.  The cramping has gotten better and I have very light bleeding but I now have bad acne and no sex drive.  I think  also have gained weight (not much, maybe 10lbs).  """,8
Methadone,Pain,"""I was diagnosed with neck arthritis at the age of 29 (I&#039;m 48) when I got chronic headaches accompanied with a grinding and cracking noise at the base of my neck. I could have lived with that, however, the headaches developed into migraines, and as a waitress, a miserable server=0 tips. It was costing me money to be in chronic pain. So, I saw a doctor, and he prescribed tramadol, then Vicodin. Then I learned of methadone. Long lasting, no acetaminophen, well within my price range, no buzzy feeling, no problems at all. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, I FEEL GOOD""",9
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have arthritis in most joints and back and neck pain.  I have used Tramadol for 2 years now. It was life changing in the way it relieved pain without nasty side effects of  hydrocodone (I got very irritable when it wore off). Seems to be taking higher dosage for less relief but still would rather continue the tramadol and use something for breakthrough pain on physical work days. If you experience nausea try a lower dose and work up to more. Stick with it,  the nausea went away for me. When I forget a day or so and go back to it I sometimes get nausea again.""",9
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I am a 31 yr. Old woman and I&#039;m on day 12 of the 14 day starter dose. I&#039;m 5&#039;8&quot; and I started at 304.6lbs. Today I weigh 290.4lbs and I have lost 2 inches in my waist. I have high blood pressure and and my left leg is held together by screws so I can only do light to moderate exercise. I&#039;m eating 1700-1800 Cal a day and drinking lots and lots of water. In my opinion, Qsymia is so far so good and very expensive. You pay for what you get.""",2
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Tried the brand name a while back and had FULL SCALE hallucinations and memory loss.  Being a nurse, I believed there was no difference between generic and brand, but after 15 years of chronic TERRIBLE insomnia, I gave the generic a try.  While I didn&#039;t have the horrid side effects, 10mg will put me to sleep well, but not stay asleep.  The controlled release helps me stay asleep, but it takes hours to fall asleep.  My doc prescribed 5mg of the immediate and 6.25 controlled, and as long as I don&#039;t use it every day (taking a day off here and there which kills me) it works for about 4-5 hours of sleep, which depending on how desperate you are is plenty.  Plus the price can&#039;t be beat.""",0
Celebrex,Pain,"""A few years before I went through menopause. I used to have incredible pain, headache and felt like my Lymph Nodes were going to burst out of my throat 3 days before my menstruation and when I started to take this it worked totally. I had tried all kinds of pain killers but nothing made any difference. My doctor had prescribed it for my back pain originally. So one day I decided to try take it for my menstrual pain and was amazed that it worked so well for my Lymph Nodes and headache as well.""",9
Valium,Anxiety,"""It&#039;s early days for me taking Valium but I have noticed a general sense of well being. I think that if you REALLY need this drug then it&#039;s a blessing. I was suffering from post operative depression and long term anxiety issues. I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m zoned out or in some kind of vegetative state. I&#039;m functionally normally but with a greater sense of calmness. Before taking Valium it was like I had a million things bouncing around in my head or like I was in a sweet shop with a mind racing around as to what lollies I wanted. I have heard negative things about Valium but I am convinced that if you genuinely need this drug then it&#039;s a wonderful thing. I give it the thumbs up.""",7
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""Strattera has changed my life, my relationships, and the way I feel about my self. This drug takes time to get into your system mine took about 2 months, with some uncomfortable side effects at first, but one you over come those this medicine truly works. The problem is most people just want to jump to the next drug. I feel like a normal human being I&#039;m no longer extremely reactive, irritable, irrational, and emotionally all over. I have found to be emotional yet stable (I&#039;m not just some zombie) I am not constantly making impulse decisions. I have improved my relationships with my family and friends and feel finally like my self and have control over my life. So great film and I hope many others find the same happiness. female 21""",1
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""In a nutshell, even though I did not want this drug to work because I hate taking medicine, it really does help me! I refuse to take benzos. My therapist talked me into trying buspar. It made me really tired at first. But honestly, now that I look back, I think it did that because it seemed to slow my racing mind down. So naturally, once I relaxed a bit more, my body finally could rest. My anxiety is not gone. But when I am in a place where I feel safe, I am able to relax and my mind isn&#039;t so noisy. It is a strange, new feeling.""",7
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have mercury-poisoning induced Bipolar II and took Lamictal. It made me feel great until I ended up in the hospital with erythema multiforme covering my whole body and aseptic meningitis. I was very disappointed because I was starting to feel really good on it. Andy Cutler Protocol has been the best treatment for me thus far, but I really wanted something to eliminate the depressive episodes (my manic ones are mild) while I get all the mercury out.""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This is my second review, last time I commented I was at 205 LBS and 11 LBS lost in two weeks.  At third weigh in on 2/22/14 I lost another 4 LBS and now weight 201lbs.  I went from 216 to 201 in 3 weeks.  I would say yes, phentermine definitely works to curb my appetite.  My next weigh in is March 1, 2014.  I hope to be under 200 (fingers crossed).  I don&#039;t want to get my hopes up since I&#039;ve already lost &quot;a lot&quot; for the first month according to my Doc.""",3
Ramelteon,Insomnia,"""Took Rozerem last night for the first time and got drowsy and fell asleep, but my body twitched all night.  My sleep was not consistent and I woke up all throughout the night.  In the morning I slept well past 11 a.m., I felt like a ton of bricks and could not get up.  I am usually up and about and running around all day long.  Today, I couldn&#039;t even leave the house I was so lethargic from the medicine.  I stayed home, didn&#039;t even change clothes, and laid on the couch with my eyes closed for hours.  It&#039;s almost 9pm the next day and I still feel really weird and tired.  My mind was in a daze all day as if I couldn&#039;t get anything done as a result.

Gabapentin,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been on it for 1 week now  suffering from bad sciatic pain caused by a herniated disc S1-L5. I was taking 6-8 ibuprofen a day and was still in pain. With only the entry dose of 1 300mg a day and 2 ibuprophen a day I can function almost normally until this disc heals...absolutely amazing medication. I won&#039;t don&#039;t plan to ramp up to the 900mg a day, getting great results with the 300. I was a little fuzzy the first day, but fine after that.""",9
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lithium put me in the hospital for a month.  I was on a respiratory tube 10 days and in a coma for 2.  It really worked before this stay.  I was also in renal for 10 days.  Once I was released my doc tried Trileptal with an anti-anxiety med and I have been episode-free for almost 3 years.  Lithium is great but have your blood levels checked VERY frequently.  If you&#039;re having trouble with other medz, please consider giving this a try.  I feel like a different person!""",6
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I am 42 years old.  I first took Accutane 30 years ago when i was 12 years old.  I had extremely bad acne.  I took my second round of Accutane at 20.  I took a third round at 23.  In between I have tried every medication and cream known to man.
Without Accutane there is no doubt I would have severe scarring.  It&#039;s not a lifetime cure for all.  I haven&#039;t been able to wear contacts since my mid twenties due to chronic dry eyes.  The side  effects can be tough.  However, without Accutane, my life would have been much different.""",4
Skyla,Birth Control,"""Update: 2 weeks in with skyla, after a week of being on Skyla I stopped taking my pills (as told by Doctor since Skyla isn&#039;t effective until 7 days after insertion) and started bleeding, more than a panty liner but not enough to fill a regular tampon, it&#039;s been like this for a week now and I&#039;m annoyed, I can&#039;t tell if this is when my period is now or what? Idk, not happy, I wanna have sex with my boyfriend but I can&#039;t because I&#039;m bleeding!! Ugh!!""",8
Secobarbital,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve suffered from chronic insomnia and severe panic attacks since early childhood and was given many medications but they didn&#039;t help me. I eventually was put on Seconal sodium (secobarbitol) by a new physician and I sleep well and don&#039;t experience panic attacks anymore. I was taught to take my Seconal under my tongue with Nutra-sweet and on a four hour empty stomach. Also, I never experienced withdrawals when I was without this medication for two months. Seconal has made my life much better now that I can get restful sleep and no longer have panic attacks.""",0
Clindamycin,Acne,"""I&#039;m a 31 year old mom of three, and had been experiencing the worst acne of my life for the past year. I&#039;ve always had acne off and on since a teen, but the past year I had cystic acne along my chin line and under my jaw like nothing else. Painful. Embarrassing. My Doc prescribed this, in the liquid form that you pat on. I use it nightly every or every other night (along with a RX benzoyl peroxide cleanser first). One month down and acne cleared up almost immediately. I will continue using for maintenance of course. I&#039;m sensitive to Retin A, this stuff though never leaves my skin dry or burned like Retin A did.""",4
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I developed cystic acne, I&#039;m guessing as a result of hormones, stress, and genetics. My doctor and I changed what we were using during the second visit, since we were doing some trial and error (figuring out what works). Since my skin is not sensitive, we went from a combination of doxycycline, tretinoin, and clyndimicine (idk how to spell it) to a combination of tretinoin of higher strength, erythromycin/BP gel, and minocycline. My skin has cleared up in a matter of 2 months with the occasional pimples and some acne scarring. I had to switch from doxy to mono because after my first round of doxy, my insurence would not cover any form of it for some reason, I which is why I gave it a 5.""",4
Ativan,Anxiety,"""After serveral failed attemps of using SSRI&#039;s to help with my panic attacks, my Dr perscribed me 0.5mg of Ativan to use when needed to &quot;break the cycle&quot; of panic. Along with everyone else, I&#039;m telling you to use with caution if you are taking Ativan, because it is very addicting. I&#039;m 21 yr old female who has suffered from panic attacks since I was 15. Ativan is a great safety net when needed, no side effects except some small cloudiness. Use with caution and be knowledgeable. Learn what panic is, what sets you off, and how to use coping mechanisms before using medication. And always do research on what medications you are being prescribed and be the judge if this medicine, in the long term, will benefit you. Knowledge is the key to beating panic.""",7
Amnesteem,Acne,"""Young teens, I&#039;m telling you, there is hope. I used to have such bad acne all over my face. I was so insecure and always so sad and it was beginning to make me depressed. I didn&#039;t even wanna look in the mirror. So I got on amnesteem. I had heard all the &quot;bad things&quot; about what it could do to you, but I didn&#039;t care I did it anyways. It was the best choice I had ever made. My skin is so clear I never really get acne anymore maybe one or two every month or so. It&#039;s so so so worth it.""",4
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I was given this medication by a dermatologist assistant, and started with the low dose of 50mg. I was a bit &quot;dried out&quot;, had to urinate more and was drinking more water. I didn&#039;t see much difference in my acne until she increased the dosage to 100mg but then I saw a major improvement. The draw back is that I am 44 years old, and my periods were getting heavier, a longer duration, and started every other week. I had some depression spells where I would cry over something very minor. I feel this medication is great for the acne sufferer who has had the same stubborn big deep blemishes for a long time, but for a hormonal person such as myself pushing menopause, it isn&#039;t ideal unfortunately.

Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have a son that has struggled with an attention problem in school since kindergarden. He is now 11 years old. We tried everything not to put him on medication. The homework struggle and impulsiveness became too much for us to handle, and we finally agreed to try something. His doctor told us about a new ADHD medication called Vyvanse. Believe this or not, it was like magic the first day. He was able to get all his work done in class, and went from a A,B,C student to all A&#039;s and one B in one quarter. We have the report cards to prove it. The side effects are minimal and for him the 30mg works great. I encourage anyone battling this problem to ask their childs doctor about Vyvanse. It has changed by sons life as well as ours.""",1
Nortriptyline,Pain,"""I was prescribed 20mg before bed to alleviate the pain form arthritis in my neck.I took them and after the second night I slept good and awoke with very little pain in the morning.However after 5 days I was not sleeping well and was like a zombie in the afternoon/evening and became very short fused.I returned to the dr who prescribed Temazapan to help me sleep and he said to increase the dose of Nortiptyline to 25mg.I discussed it with my wife and she said she would prefer if I didn&#039;t as she was not happy with the side effects.I stopped taking them and felt &quot;normal&quot; again by the next afternoon.I have found that ibuprofen helps when the pain is severe although that doesn&#039;t happen so much anymore because I have discovered Gelatin.""",9

Contrave,Obesity,"""I got Contrave and shelled out $99.00 for it. I took it the first day and experienced depressions and flu like symptoms plus I had insomnia. I took it the second day, thinking it would get better. Well that was a huge mistake. I felt like my body was freezing and then on fire. I could not function whatsoever. I was at work and had to be driven home by my co workers. I wanted to jump out of my co workers van! I could not concentrate or sit still. I also experienced diarrhea like never before!!! I have never gone through withdrawals symptoms like this before but I am never taking this rubbish again!""",2
Vilazodone,Depression,"""I&#039;ve tried Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa and none of them worked well. They would work maybe a month and the depression crept back into my life. I started taking Viibryd and the recommendation of a doctor and trusted friend and my life has changed dramatically for the better. I don&#039;t have the wiped out feeling and my sex drive has stayed the same. This medicine has been a God send for me. I had to fight to get my insurance to cover it but it has so been worth it.""",5
Hydroxyzine,Pain,"""Hydroxyzine seems to help more with my reaction to pain than with the actual pain. If I take hydroxyzine while I have shin splints, I still feel quite a bit of pain; it&#039;s just that I feel significantly less distressed and distracted by the pain than I normally would be. 

It works best for pain if taken with an actual painkiller. I prefer using naproxen, as the hydroxyzine seems to counteract the stomachache I always get from this NSAID.""",9
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""I started on 20mg Adderall XR 1 month ago. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 13. I was first medicated on Ritalin and I went off of it because it made me very uneasy on the insides. I managed to get through school with all applied courses because a gold fish had a higher attention span then me. If I could turn back time I would have chosen the Adderall path. Just a few side effects that really weren&#039;t to bad, I lost a lot of weight because it suppressed my appetite, it was all weight that I could afford to lose and I feel better about myself, I do however have to make a list of tasks before I begin my day or I just get super hyper focused on one thing for to long. I grind my teeth and I have to take sleep-aids but it&#039;s worth it.""",1
Zyprexa,Insomnia,"""I have been prescribed Zyprexa 10mg just two days ago. It was prescribed for insomnia and an extra medication for my depression. I have not slept as well as I was told I would. I have had major restlessness in my legs and arms to where I haven&#039;t slept well at all. I have felt very drowsy during the day. I have also tried Ambein which also gave me restlessness in my legs. Not sure if this is right one for me either. Maybe I just need more time? I have noticed I am eating more throughout the day. Not worried about that so much since I need to put on some weight.""",0
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""originally on seroxat (paxil) for 17 years. felt so good on 20mg that after having my child I thought I would come off it as thinking of having second baby. I was put on prozac to help with withdrawal.  after 4 months on prozac I was an absolute mess so Dr put me on effexor. I&#039;ve been on this now for 6 months. I cry literally every day. it has created obsessional and horrible thoughts, I am constantly tired.  I have anxiety and panic. I feel it has actually created new symptoms that I never had. I do not like this drug and am coming off it as soon as I get an appointment with the psychiatrist""",5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I find that if I take the Ambien and go directly to bed it works very well.  If I take it and then delay going to bed by doing dishes or cleaning before bed I have unusual effects.  After sleeping for a very short period of time I will get up, go to the kitchen and make waffles.  This has happened a handful of times.  I&#039;m always surprised to have my family thanking me for taking the trouble for making waffles.  Really no trouble since I don&#039;t remember any of it.""",0
Tretinoin,Acne,"""This stuff is magic.  I was prescribed Tretinoin 0.05 over a year ago, and after months of skin torture, and super low self-confidence, almost everyone said I had amazing skin once my face cleared up. This medication will teach you patience, but please whatever you do, bare with it. It&#039;s so worth it, I promise. There are severe breakouts in the first 3 months, but it&#039;s totally normal - it means is working. The medication gets deep in your pores and cleans out all the acne deep in your skin which is why you break out severely in the beginning of this medication. Stay on this cream too, never stop using it or you&#039;ll regret it. Once your face is use to it and clears out, use it every other day.""",4
Xanax,Anxiety,"""This drug literally saved my life. Before I started taking it, there was no quality of life left. I would get so nervous around people I couldn&#039;t go out into public at all, had severe panic attacks all of the time... I&#039;ve dealt with this my entire life, and it took me 17 years being put on every anti depressant/mood stabilizer/even anti psych meds except anti anxiety meds (because doctors are too afraid to prescribe them...we have a lot of junkies here) I finally found a doctor who understands me. I take 1mg xanax 3 times a day and 1,200 mg of lithium a day. This medication has changed my life. I no longer struggle with my life, I feel like for the first time I have total control and it feels great.""",7
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I am 140 lb, 29 year old woman. I was prescribed 150 mg of Venlafaxine XR. I only took it for 5 days due to the horrendous side effects. I experienced dry mouth, excessive sweating, blurred vision, constipation, and increased heart rate. I wasn&#039;t on it long enough to determine its effectiveness; I wasn&#039;t willing to deal with side effects. My doctor switched me to Wellbutrin and I have not experienced any withdrawal symptoms.""",5
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I recently got my life back. I was finally diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. I have been on about every medicine for depression you can name over the last twenty years. None had any good results. A lot of them had severe bad side effects. I did not sleep well, cried all the time, was agitated, reclusive and unmotivated. Bless my PNP for trying me on Saphris! I can honestly say for the first time, in a long time, that life is good.""",6
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have Bi-Polar II. Have suffered from depression, hypo-mania, and anxiety. One thing constant was difficulty sleeping. Sometimes night after night. I would just lay there and my mind would race. I have been taking Trazadone for a little over a year. 50mg-100 if needed. I&#039;ve taken as much as 100, but often 50 then another 25 if needed. It&#039;s the best sleep I have ever had. I sleep through the night. If I have to get up for the bathroom, I fall right back to sleep. If I take higher doses I do get some grogginess, occasional blurry vision, and joint ache. But getting good sleep is worth it and helps with my other bi-polar symptoms. These days I&#039;ve only been taking 50 but it  still works and side effects are fewer.""",0
Strattera,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been on every ADHD medication under the sun. After heavily abusing adderall and lying to my doctors, I broke out in a huge body rash that went all the way up to my face. I didn&#039;t like the way adderall made me feel. Like a zombie. I was wide awake, felt euphoric, but I didn&#039;t do anything. I just sat there for hours chainsmoking while on my phone. I decided to try straterra. I love it! It does everything adderall did minus the tweaky stimulant effect. And, I can&#039;t abuse it :) my adhd is under control,  my depression disappeared, and I feel like myself again.""",1
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I started getting anxiety my first year of college. I had previously had mild anxiety, but it was not as debilitating. I was constantly worrying what others thought about me and had obsessive thoughts. I started on 10mg of lexapro and it completely changed my outlook on life. I did not realize how fun life could be before I lived it without the looming cloud of anxiety. It also helped tremendously with anxiety surrounding the intrusive thoughts. Some things that WORSENED my anxiety while on lexapro were birth control pills (hormone imbalance worsens anxiety) and hard alcohol. I take 1/2 tsp inositol powder (a type of vitamin) and probiotics that seem to help my anxiety and depression in addition to the lexapro.""",7

Been taking this for about 3 months and things are a lot less stressful. I can handle light social situations again. Im actually able to sleep all night again. This combined with my fleet of other meds I&#039;m able to function a lot more. Ive been on the usual xanax and what not, those were fun but long term didn&#039;t work for me (i grew up yay) Need more meds like this on the market.""",7
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""Treatment for ADHD save my life. Don&#039;t believe all the hype and the stigma around this diagnosis and treatment. It is a real condition there is real treatment and it makes a real and profound difference to the lives of people with this debilitating condition. So don&#039;t be afraid to seek help if you think you might have ADHD it is not just childhood illness in in my opinion it generally consists persists in some form for the duration of your life just like any other disease""",1
Spironolactone,Acne,"""So I started taking 100 my since December. Took about 2-3 months to see a difference . HUGE improvement . Nothing else has come close to working like this has. But... CRAZY IRREGUALR PERIODS. I&#039;m talking about going from a 40 day Clycle before starting spiro to having my period every 10 days. I don&#039;t know what to do. I&#039;ve been weaning off &amp; so far so good. I just don&#039;t want to break out like crazy but I also don&#039;t wanna put up with so many periods . I also went from good/normal to really low blood pressure.""",4
Zoloft,Depression,"""I was suffering from being a slave to my negative thoughts, making assumptions about my relationship that my partner was cheating on me or having a secret life, constantly being controlling over where things go in the house, how things should be, really severe mood swings and ridiculous anger which I would ignite a lot of arguments and have the urge to get physical and just completely lose it and not think rationally. My marriage was on the verge of failure due to my negative actions and my husband was at his breaking point. My doc prescribed me 50mg of Zoloft and I finally started it, I&#039;m on week 2 and I feel incredibly calm, content and full of life again. I feel like I can handle situation in a positive manner.""",5
Viibryd,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking this medication now for 3 months and I&#039;ve noticed my depression is A LOT better. I do get down when PMSing (more so than normal).  I&#039;d rate it higher if it weren&#039;t for the electric shock feeling I get through my body if I don&#039;t take it at the same time everyday and my lack of a sex drive. I&#039;ve tried Zoloft (worked for 4 months or so and stopped working for me) and Effexor (I felt constant rage in my chest), so far the Viibryd is the best of the 3.  I also have post traumatic stress disorder so now I am looking to see if it&#039;s possible to add a medication to the Viibryd for this as it does not help for PTSD.  I take Xanax occasionally as needed for anxiety.""",5
Phentermine,Obesity,"""on 1/24/2017 I started taking 1 pill of Adipex 37.5mg once a day. I started at 262lbs. As of today 3/8/17 I now weigh 247lbs. It gives me energy without the jitters. I also suppresses my appetite I force myself to eat 5 small meals a day.  I also do at least a 30 min workout 4 times a week. Adipex works! My normal doctor will not prescribe this medication so I see a weight loss doctor. I pay 100.00 a month for the meds.""",2
Topamax,Bipolar Disorde,"""This is a fantastic medication.  The day I was prescribed it and started taking it was nothing short of a miracle.  I had never heard of anything like it before.  I had been on and off trials of anti-depressants like Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Zypreza, etc for years and none of them did anything for me.  This was an entirely different class of medication and the new psychopharmacologist I had told me so before he gave it to me.  When it kicked in after several weeks I literally felt it one day while riding the bus.  I was trying to have one of those negative, anxiety-ridden feelings and a flush just came over me that downgraded that sensation.  The only drawback is that this medication completely stopped working for me after one and a half years.""",6
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Before starting Accutane, I read through reviews online and I got to say... most of them scared the poo out of me. Intense side effects &amp; bad reviews. But let me tell you, I have been on 40mg for 2 months once a day, then 40mg twice a day for another 2 months &amp; it is a miracle. My face has cleared up so much; I am so grateful for this medicine. Yes, there are side effect my lips have never been this chapped in my life, my skin is very dry and I&#039;ve had minimum 12 nose bleeds (pre Accutane - never had one before in my life). I do have a month or maybe two-three left on it my nurse said, but I believe it is all worth it. I have never experienced any horrible body aches or any of the other horror stories. Stick with it till the end!!""",4
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had the Mirena for 3 weeks now and I hate it. I am 27, no kids and the insertion was SO painful. They didn&#039;t even give me a heads up or anything. For 10 minutes I couldn&#039;t even get up off the exam table. I was finally able to hobble home and the pain was so excruciating all I could do was bawl for 6 hours after. For the first 2 days the pain remained. Ever since then I have periodic cramping throughout the day. Some of the cramps are mild and some make me double over. I would guess3-4 cramps every hour that last about 30 seconds each. At first the bleeding was like normal menstrual blood, then it was non-existent, and now its bright red. Every time I cramp I expel a puddle of blood and it even pools in the toilet when I pee.""",8
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I have been taking amitriptyline for 3 and a half years since I was 12 (now 15), due to sleeping problems. I started on 10mg doses every night for the first couple of months but that didn&#039;t work so the doctors gradually increased me up to 50 mg (current dosage). They started working for a couple of months however they no longer work but I have never had any side affects. Now I get little sleep and am often feeling sick due to lack of sleep and often can no longer concentrate at school. Hope this doesn&#039;t happen to you at work.""",0
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""Given that I&#039;ve had issues with addiction, my previous psychiatrist would not prescribe me any benzos and instead prescribed me Vistaril, which I found pretty useless. For someone with acute panic and anxiety issues, benzos really should be the first and last word on the topic. Ativan is great. Because of my addiction history, I am very careful with it and never take it more than prescribed. It is enough to make me feel &quot;evened out&quot; during the day without making me loopy, euphoric or sleepy. And at night, it puts me out without giving me a &quot;hangover&quot; the following day like Valium does.""",7
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""I take Effexor for anxiety which has greatly increased my insomnia. Without something for sleep, I&#039;ll wake up anywhere from 20-30 times a night. I fall asleep easily but wake up repeatedly. I&#039;ve tried many things over the years to try and help improve my sleep; 5HTP, SAMe, Melatonin, phenibut, klonopin, trazadone, seroquel, etc. The gabapentin is a life saver. I take it at the same time every night and sleep like a baby. There are no side effects that I can tell and ZERO grogginess in the morning. I&#039;m amazed that I wake up refreshed and ready for the day. I haven&#039;t slept this well since I was a child. I highly recommend being open to trying this if you&#039;re suffering like I was.""",0
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I have been on 10 mg of brand ambien for 12 years.  It works, but only the BRAND name - none of the generics worked. My insurance would not cover brand ambien and I was stuck paying $435 a month!  I tried many medications, including several benzos, Serequel (halluncinated on that one!), etc. My osteopath had samples of Belsomra and suggested I give it a try.  At first I wasn&#039;t quite convinced it was working.  I gave it a good week.  I can tell you know I LOVE this medication!  It definitely mimics a more natural sleep cycle.  I do have some weird dreams, but that usually right before waking after 8 hours of sleep.  I would highly encourage trying this but give it a full week.  It stops the alerted mind and stress thinking.""",0
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""Is a tricky drug but cons out weigh pros I experienced weight gain good if under weight not good for someone already appetite like me took a month to experience antidepressant and anti anxiety properties also helped with sleep but had bad effect on intellectual ability and totally ruined sex drive and actually made me more anxious in mornings and caused head aches when I tried to stop taking so would not recommend why do doctor s push the SSRI s all the time when Valium far more effective for sleep and anxiety problems this and St Johns and comprehensive supplements and improved diet and active lifestyle s far better choice""",7
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am a junior in high school who was just diagnosed with both severe ADD and ADHD. I go to a pretty good high school where I achieved around a 3.2 last year (generally get a 3.6 but last semester of my sophomore year I got like a 2.7). After I got on Vyvanse my GPA went up to around a 4.0 and I am in mostly honors and AP classes. Although I was always thought to be smart and nobody ever denied that, they would say I was lazy and unorganized and simply didn&#039;t apply myself. Now I get A&#039;s without effort, my teachers love me, I hardly have to pay attention, and I also have a love for school/my subjects that I didn&#039;t have before. I am now excited to go to school and function on a much higher level. I would most definitely recommend Vyvanse.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Accutane gave me completely clear skin after 7 months of using it and 4 years of severe acne. Even though people say they got horrible scars from the zits they had during their treatment, I have very few and they&#039;re small enough that you can&#039;t see them unless your face is right next to mine. I got a dry scalp, lips, and skin, but it was never enough to prevent me from wearing contacts like some people warn. To help with dry lips, get Dr. Dan&#039;s Cortibalm. It&#039;s the best chapstick out there. I got minor to moderate pain in my knees too, but it wasn&#039;t anything I couldn&#039;t put up with. And that horrible breakout that they tell you you&#039;re going to have when you first start? Mine was barely noticeable.""",4
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Very smooth stimulant. Effective for a little over 8 hours in my experience, not the 12 or 13 hours the manufacturer claims. I take 40mg and have for over a month and have no need to up the dose. I gave it 9/10 instead of 10/10 because it takes 2 to 3 hours to start working. But there is no crash and is incredibly smooth compared to IR Adderall, Focalin or Ritalin. I also have an prescription for 10mg IR Adderall to take at 5pm so after work I can study or work out or just be productive because by 5pm the Vyvanse has totally worn off.""",1
Celexa,Depression,"""Be careful when taking this medicine. Very helpful to relieve depression, but will interfere with your sleep. After only taking it for 4 days, I was fired for falling asleep on the job because I did not hear the phone or the knock on the dept door.  I do not remember going to sleep as I usually would and normally I&#039;m a very light sleeper. It also made me sweat a lot and I lost the ability to cry. On the good side, it relieved my depression, I lost my appetite and my thoughts became much clearer.""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I wanted this to work so bad! I&#039;ve always been sensitive to Hormonal birth control so I had the copper IUD for 2 years but it moved it out place and cause me constant yeast infections. So after having that removed I tried the Kyleena hoping it being a low does option I&#039;d have no migraine issues. Well needless to say I&#039;m having it removed after just 3 days. Have had a constant migraine since 12hrs after it was inserted and am so nauseous. I&#039;m told this isn&#039;t a very common reaction but can happen if you get migraines easily, which I do. Oh well - no BC for me!""",8
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I I&#039;ve taken Ambien, and now the generic, for 10 or 11 years. I usually took it only when sleeping away from home. The last month, or so, I&#039;ve needed it every night to fall asleep. I always try to fall asleep on my own first but it has become increasingly difficult. I have absolutely no side effects and never have had. I never get out of bed during the night and feel totally refreshed when I wake in the morning. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do without it.""",0
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I am a 42 year old woman, 5&#039;0&quot; and weigh 232lbs.  I am way too short to be this heavy. Severe depression over the years brought me to this weight.  Today is my first day on Aipex 37.5. I took 1/2 pill after having my morning smoothie.  I am doing Dr. Oz Day off Diet along with this.  So far so good I only felt a bit of a head rush but otherwise the energy is perfect. I&#039;m giving myself until January of next year to complete my full weight loss of 107lbs. I will be walking everyday as well. I will check in with updates every Monday. Hope I can help folks here as well.""",2
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I used to take lunesta and it worked fine but I went back to ambien. Then I stopped both and my insomnia is back a year later. Personal issues. I decided to try lunesta because ambien would make me so tired I couldn&#039;t wake up in the morning. With lunesta I can wake up before my alarm clock. That&#039;s exactly what I needed. I haven&#039;t tried taking it for more than 2 months. Hopefully the effect doesn&#039;t wear off. If so I&#039;ll have to just go back to Benadryl.""",0
Strattera,ADHD,"""Been on Straterra for about a month now. Only thing I&#039;ve noticed is that it gives me heart burn. I&#039;ve also become more agitated. Has not helped with focus at all.
Still daydream. Still very forgetful. This medication really sucks for me. I know alot of Dr&#039;s hate giving stimulant drugs for ADHD but it&#039;s what helps me. I personally think if you are gonna take a non-stimulant drug you might as well take all-natural meds.""",1
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Had implanon since Jan 2015, inserted 5 days after giving birth at the recommendation of the hospital. Within 4 months I started losing my hair, I had long irregular periods that would last 4-8 weeks at a time and no amount of pills prescribed by my gynae would make it stop. My most recent period lasted almost two months and was thoroughly unpleasant dark coloured blood. My gynae also reported thinning of my uterus. I have gained about 10kg and counting, my breasts are enormous, and have experienced some issues with libido. I was on Yasmin before for seven years and had none of the above side effects. Having it removed asap and will go back to Yasmin.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""My wife started taking Adipex in December of 2014, she finished it up through April 2015 and went from 187 lbs to 152 lbs.  She kept to the same 1200 calorie diet she has always done for almost two years, and she works out on a variety of fitness classes to running an hour on a treadmill 3-4 times a week.

It is 6/14/15 and I weigh 288 lbs and I am 5&#039;10&quot;. I work out 4-5 times a week doing exercises like basketball twice a week for two hours and running two other times a week and lifting twice a week. So I am at the gym 5-6 times a week.  Now that it is summer I plan on working out for an hour in the morning 3 times a week of cardio and lift at night.""",3
Alesse,Birth Control,"""So far Alesse 28 has been a pretty good experience! I&#039;ve only been on it for over a month, but the good outweighs the bad! This is my first birth control I&#039;ve tried. I was very nervous this birth control would increase my breast size, just because I have naturally big boobs (38DD) and don&#039;t want them bigger. Haven&#039;t really noticed increase in breast size, maybe just made them a bit fuller. The first two weeks on the pill I started to break out which freaked me out because my skin was perfect pre-pill and I&#039;ve read reviews where it ruins some people&#039;s skin! Breakouts cleared by week 3. Only negative side effect I&#039;ve been noticing a lot is I&#039;m always hungry! Haven&#039;t gained weight because I eat pretty healthy and go to the gym regularly.""",8
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had 3 aortic aneurysms. The last operation also involved a patch placed over a surgical hernia caused from removal of the two lower ribs on my left side.  I&#039;ve been using oxycodone for the past 4 years and aside from insomnia when I take it in the evenings, I am very pleased with the way it controls my pain.  I take it only when I am in pain and limit the dosage to 10 - 20 mgs. (10 mgs per dose, occasionally twice a day).  With this usage, I haven&#039;t had dependency or addiction.""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I took Roaccutane 9 years ago at the age of 30. Although I didn&#039;t have cystic acne, I had had persistent facial acne since the age of 12, and nothing helped. Initially the drug helped a lot, with the major side effect being severely chapped lips and dry skin. After several months of treatment my dose was increased. Within days I was depressed and miserable, with crying spells. It took me a while to put 2 and 2 together and consider the medicine as a likely cause. I dropped the dose down again and I quickly improved. However, I feel the damage was done and I gradually became more and more depressed and ultimately was taken of the medicine. For the past 9 years I have suffered depression and anorexia nervosa.""",4
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have had severe bipolar and manic depression for ten years. I was diagnosed at age 14, and have tried countless other medications over the years, none of which helped me in the least. I&#039;ve been on lamotrigine for about 7 months now and I can honestly say this is the first time in ten years where I feel like I am myself again. This medicine has given me my life back. I cannot praise it enough and I strongly suggest anyone with similar conditions try lamotrigine. It has saved my life, quite literally.""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""So I went back and forth about starting contrave, weighting 275 and nothing was really working for anytime long term, I decided to try. I started in May and its now August, Im currently 245. Its been quite sometime since I&#039;ve been here. All that said, I will say the first week sucked....I was nauseated, stomach cramps, felt like crap. Every day I debated with myself if I was going to continue taking it but I wanted to try, even though i felt bad. I&#039;d say for the first month I wasnt hungry and I couldnt finish all of whatever i put on my plate. I didn&#039;t have desire for sweets or fried anything. Now, those cravings have slowly came back, but I&#039;m still eating smaller portions.Keep an eye on your bl pressure and don&#039;t drink alcohol.""",2
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I was given Dilaudid after a painful hemorrhoid surgery. Just writing this, I&#039;m taken back to the excruciating pain following surgery. It was initially administered by I.V in hospital. I was then sent home with a prescription of it. This medicine is very potent and should be taken only under close watch of a physician. No side effects other than much needed pain relief and much needed sleep.""",9
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Belviq for 1 month.  The first day I was extremely tired and weak.  No other symptoms!  I have lost 5 lbs this month.  I take 10mg belviq 2x a day have been taking 30 mg of phentermine in the middle of the day last few weeks.  Prior to this i was on phentermine 37.5 mg twice a day and was able to lose and keep off about 30 lbs.  You still have to work at it to lose weight with this drug, it just makes things a little easier.  Within the first few days I could tell I was eating smaller portions and getting full fast. I have 15 pounds to lose to get to my goal weight so my weight loss is slower than someone with more to lose.  Usually I will lose 1-2 per month so I am very happy with 5 lbs!  It is expensive but its worth a try.""",3
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have some kind of Depressive Disorder-- Never have had a diagnosis done but I ruminate a lot. I also suffered a manic episode a few months ago which served to make me feel more trapped and hopeless than ever. I started Latuda about 6 weeks ago at 20 mg. My psych was confident about this medication. Three weeks into the treatment I began to feel way less depressed. I was socializing more, and I wouldn&#039;t get stuck in my thoughts. It was wonderful. Unfortunately it lasted only for a few days and the depression came back. I continued to work with my doctor and we increased the dosage from 40 to 60 to 80. Right now, I am tapering off of it and feeling more miserable and incapacitated than I have in my entire life. It&#039;s horrible. I feel like I don&#039;t know what to do with myself. The voice in my head is relentless.

This medication made me worse, and my psych and I had very high hopes for it. I couldn&#039;t sleep on it as well. I wanted to stick it out to see if a higher does would work for me but decided that the depression I&#039;m experiencing now is much too intense to push on through. I&#039;m going to see her ASAP after the holidays and ask to be put on Lactimal. Maybe this will work for you, but it was not my niche. I&#039;m giving it a two only because I experienced no side effects aside from the insomnia, and Seroquel took care of that.""",6
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""My doctor Currently has me on Opana ER 5mg every 12 hours and let me tell you it&#039;s a God send. I was taking 4 or 7 Norco 10mg a day every 4 hours because I was always in so much pain now since my doctor switched me from Norco to Opana ER the results have been amazing I no longer have pain constantly and whenever I walk a long way I still sometimes have pain but on a scale of 1-10 the pain is only a 2. I&#039;m so thankful for this medicine because now I&#039;m no longer in pain and another good thing about this medication is I don&#039;t have any side effects nor do I get that fuzzy feeling that other opioids give you . I highly recommend anyone who has chronic severe lower back pain to talk with your doctor about switching to Opana ER.""",9
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I had never had anxiety or panic attacks up until a year ago.. it came out of nowhere and I didn&#039;t know what was causing it. I think it was just overall life stressors in general...I was prescribed vistaril after having panic attacks and anxiety. I had never taken anything for anxiety before this so I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect. It helped slightly but didn&#039;t really take the anxiety away. Made me really sleepy and calmed me down in a sense but I could still feel like I had the anxiousness in the back of my mind. My doctor prescribed me Zoloft instead 50mg and it&#039;s worked amazing for me.. I actually feel more like my normal self and rarely get anxiety anymore.""",7
Duac,Acne,"""I had incredibly bad acne. I would get picked on for having such bad skin, my skin would make me cry it was so horrible. Nothing worked for me, everything I took to control my acne just made it worse. Then I tried duac and nothing cleared my skin faster than this. This product has made my skin go from nothing but spots to completely flawless. I would recommend this to everyone with acne or blemishes.""",4
Strattera,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 32 year old male and have had symptoms of ADHD all my life, but chose not to treat it because the types of medications available seemed to &#039;take something away&#039; from my personality.  I finally reached a point that my wife begged me to do something, so I started with Strattera due to my doctor&#039;s recommendation.  I&#039;ve been on 40mg for 2 months now, and notice a major difference.  I now have a desire to get on the floor and play with the kids, whereas before it seemed tedious and boring.  I find that I&#039;m not as tired at the end of the day/week because my thoughts are not distracted, by all the &#039;noise&#039; that I seem to have from the ADHD.  I&#039;m still new to the drug, and things could change, but for now, I am really happy.""",1
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Well I must admit I was skeptical when my doctor offered this Belviq. I have tried everything under the sun without much success. I figured the first 2 weeks are free so why not? I lost 7 lbs in 2 weeks which for me is great! No side effects like the other medicine I tried. I got my next prescription which I had to pay for. My doctor has to fill out some medical necessity form for my insurance to cover it. Looking forward to losing more weight. Again no side effects! Wow!""",3
Ritalin,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been taking methylphenidate (Ritalin) for years. I started during my professional career, because according to my psych, I am &quot;too smart to sit still&quot;, and that because of that, my brain gets bored easily then my attention span fades. With Ritalin I can focus like a laser on tasks, get much more done, stay organized, and it also helps with that afternoon sleepiness. Added bonus is it revs up your basal metabolic rate, and reduces appetite so you can lose weight easily.
Downside, it increases BP. If you have high BP you may want to avoid it.
I take a 20 mg pill 3-4 times a day, never after dinner if you want to sleep.""",1
Zoloft,Depression,"""I was on Cipralex for 3 years and it destroyed my life. I lost 3 years of my life leaving school and doing nothing but sit at home worthless. Then I switched to Zoloft, I felt better on Zoloft but still the same complaint of being a &ldquo;zombie&rdquo;. I have never felt it is me for the past 10 years. I had tried getting off these drugs so many times but everytime I do it I feel better for the first few months then I collapse, again. It is very hard to be on them, and to be off them at the same time. My advice for you is to try them at last. Never start with antidepressants. Thank you and good luck.""",5
Cymbalta,Depression,"""I had mild anxiety and intermittent depression. I always pushed through and never thought of medicines. My girlfriend suggested I speak to a psych and I started Cymbalta. In 10 days I had no more intrusive thoughts talking me down, making me stressed, guilty. After 9 weeks, I&#039;m a new man. Small things don&#039;t worry me, I am patient and calm driving, I don&#039;t wake up for toilet then stay awake worrying, my relationship is closer, I&#039;m nicer to be with. Cons? My libido decreased and climax is harder to achieve (but more intense). The medicine felt strange (out-of-body) at first but I got used to that. I drink more water, I yawn in the afternoons, I grind my jaw a bit, get breathless, mild headaches some days. But my life is much better with this medicine.""",5
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve taken Cymbalta for almost a year for depression and anxiety. I&#039;m also taking Buspar. My anxiety and depression are noticeably improved. I have tried many of the SSRI&#039;s without any help, but this SNRI is great. I take 40mg/day. I&#039;ve been as high as 60mg/day but found no help at the higher dosage. The only side effect might be a bit of drowsiness. I tried to reduce my dosage quickly and found this is not a drug one wants to &#039;cold-turkey&#039; to get off the drug. The benefits far exceed any bad side effects.""",7
Duac,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using Duac gel for around two years now. I know it&#039;s supposed to be a 12 week treatment for acne however when I first used this I had acne and I used it for maybe two weeks and my acne was gone. Once I stop using Duac gel I get the odd spots so I just use it everyday to prevent my spots coming back and I take a two week break every three months. I live in the UK so I get this product prescribed to me and a prescription on the NationalHealthService here is """,4
Ativan,Anxiety,"""I recently started getting anxiety. It started very slow and began to get worse. I went to hospital very anxious one day. They did all test and as I already knew found nothing. I asked for something to calm me down. They gave me 1.0mg Ativan IV. The minute the nurse pulled the needle out I was ready to go home as if nothing happen. Slept like a baby that night .I was good for like 4 days until I started to feel anxious again. I just started Zoloft today which takes some 1 or 2 weeks to work and Ativan for in case I get another attack before Zoloft kicks in. For me Ativan has been great.""",7
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I am 40 years old. I have dealt with social anxiety since my teen years. I have been on Wellbutrin XR 150 mg twice daily for several months, which has given me energy, improved mood, and increase sex drive. I started gabapentin a couple weeks ago for pain relief related to a slipped disc impinging nerves in my back, sciatica. I am taking 600 mg tthree times a day. I am amazed!! Social anxiety is gone! First time in my life. I have actually been chatty and social without breaking into a sweat from nerves. Also haven&#039;t reached for my when required Ativan at all since starting gabapentin. I couldn&#039;t be happier about this accidental discovery. Life changing. Also note that I am a recovering alcoholic. Maybe defective gaba has been the culprit?""",7
Sertraline,Depression,"""I took Zoloft (generic) shortly after my anxiety got horribly severe. I took lexapro a few years ago but didn&#039;t like the sexual side effects. Doctor put me on Prozac but that appeared to put me into a deep depression. I had never had depression, just anxiety but I couldn&#039;t get out of bed I was just paralyzed. After a few weeks of that I decided to try Zoloft. Within the first three weeks I felt tremendously better. By 6 weeks I felt totally back to normal and NO sexual side effects! This has been my miracle drug""",5
Tramadol,Anxiety,"""When I was prescribed Tramadol for abdominal pain, little did I know about the Bonus effects.

I was able to lose 20lbs in 3 months (less appetite). 

My mood became so good and I got my joy of life back. I took 50mg daily.

I felt less anxious and depressed. Mostly, I cared less about what people think of me. I started to swim and hike. My mom, who is against pills, said &quot; you changed so much whatever that you do, keep doing it&quot;. I&#039;m a 45 yo male.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Phentermine 37.5mg, 1Tab 2hrs after brkfst and half tab 6hrs before sleep. First day I experienced fast heart rate, dry mouth and insomnia after a couple days it went away.I go to the gym 3x a week, have to remind myself to eat at times. I started on March 30 2015 weighing at 207lbs my current weight today 06/18/15 is 179.6lbs I&#039;m really happy I don&#039;t think I ever weighed this much since JR high. Nothing has worked for me,but phentermine sure has, highly recommended.""",3
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""Cymbalta saved me.  I was in a state of constant recurring anxiety with many physical symptoms such as vomiting every morning, shaking, and over feeling of panic and disassociation.  My thoughts were swirling (due to a very stressful situation) almost constantly.  I started on 30mg and noticed an improvement within 2 weeks.  I still had some anxiety in the mornings so my dose was increased to 60 mg.  I have 0 anxiety now and am able to more calmly and clearly work through stressful or worrisome situations.  I had very great reservations about any kind of medication and only decided to try because I had no options.  It has been a godsend for me and I have had zero side effects.  Don&#039;t rule it out, it may save your life.""",7
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda on the 6th of September  at 0.6mg and each week up by 0.6, in 3 weeks I have lost 4lbs which is disappointing (I know we all want a wonder cure!) My appetite  has definitely reduced, eating far less but then on other days really hungry. Side effects of dizziness seem to be my enemy along with peeing much less so definitely upping my water intake. Occasional bruising from the jabs but other than that not a lot :)

Not sure yet if I will get another pack - any tips for really losing the beef whilst on this? x""",2
Cymbalta,Depression,"""Have suffered depression most of my life. Am now 50  and was prescribed Cymbalta after experiencing a debilitating bout of severe depression about 15 months ago. I was unable to function. I had been taking it for about two and a half years previously and decided to ween off it but after 3 months fell into the deep hole mentioned above. I take 60mg at night and sleep well, I have to watch my weight and I experience constipation. I find it hard to cry (better than the alternative right?) and also feel somewhat lethargic but overall it keeps me feeling &#039;normal&#039;.""",5
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve only taken this for a week. 35mg phendimetrazine twice a day and I don&#039;t feel anything at all. No extra energy, I&#039;m still consuming as much coffee. In fact I have been sleeping even more since starting. It might curb my appetite a smidge if I take the tablet just in the right amount of time before a meal. Four-ish hours later though my hunger is back in full force. Usually have hunger pains then too for eating less when I ate when it mildly suppressed my appetite. No weird side effects except a chalky taste in my throat. This stuff has been pretty useless I follow up with my doctor later this week and I will be requesting something else.""",2
Copper,Birth Control,"""1) hurt like hell going in, I don&#039;t care if it was only 30 seconds it was excruciating. (I&#039;ve never given birth) 2) it did its job and prevented pregnancy the 8 months I was on it 3) made periods very heavy and longer 4) made my vagina smell awful!! And honest to goodness that has never happened so I knew it was the IUD ... Disgusting. I couldn&#039;t take smelling like an animal anymore so I got my bf to help me take it out. I&#039;m not a doctor but if you hate paragard as much as I did and wanna save yourself a copay then spread em and let your dude pull it out with tweezers. 5) didn&#039;t feel anything upon removal""",8
Yasmin,Acne,"""I&#039;m actually on Laila 35 which is the generic version and it has taken some time for my skin to get where it is but I had horrible cystic acne on my jawline and then just general acne on my face, chest and back. The pill has absolutely cleared my skin to the point where I can go out and not feel like I need makeup. Maybe once I have my scars treated, I might not even need makeup for school. I get heaps of compliments on how much better my skin is and looks, let alone how GOOD I feel. Unless you have acne you wouldn&#039;t understand that its not just something on you face that goes away when you use a cleanser, it&#039;s a mental thing. Take this and don&#039;t expect instant results.""",4
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I jammed my hip about 6 weeks ago.  It had been sore and hurting, but starting 10 days ago the sciatic pain was running down my right leg constantly.  I was eating Aleve and Advil.  Heat did not help.  Ice did not help.  I could barely walk.  I even had to take a day off work because I could not get in a comfortable position.  My doctor gave me a steroid shot and had no effect on the pain.  I had taken Gabapentin before when I had a pinched nerve in my neck from a car accident and the pain was running down my are.  I called my doctor yesterday and asked him if he would call me some in. He did.  100mg, 3 times per day.  I can already tell a difference.  The shooting, stabbing pain running down my leg through my foot has subsided.""",9
Amitriptyline,Depression,"""I&#039;ve had severe anxiety my whole life paired with depression and bipolar disorder. Ever since I was a child, I&#039;ve had chronic migraines and headaches, especially at ages where I just shouldn&#039;t be having them. My doctor prescribed me this to calm me down and help stabilize my brain activity, so as to halt the anxiety and depression he thought was causing my headaches and migraines.
The pill worked fine after the first few doses, but I guess my body developed a tolerance. Now, when I don&#039;t take it, I&#039;m extremely nervous and my depressive tendencies skyrocket. My headaches and migraines never went away. I feel that this pull had a negative effect on me rather than actually helping, and I will be consulting my doctor for something else.""",5
Butrans,Pain,"""I have been on the Butrans Patch (20) for three weeks.  The results have exceeded my hopes after years of enduring chronic pain related to Fibromyalgia.  The relentless pain in my neck and back while sleeping has been reduced at least 90%.  I am able to make my bed, bathe, cook and do laundry most days.  I am more tired than normal, which is probably attributed to my increase in activity each day.  The negatives so far include moderate agitation and mild itching and irritation at the location site.""",9
Metadate CD,ADHD,"""My son is getting ready to turn 7. He has been on Metadate CD for 2 years. We first started him out on the 10mg but after six months we had to go up to 20mg. Before he started the Metadate the teacher would have to chase him around the room and keep him from doing flips during circle time. The school even suggested that I pull him out for an extra year since he was a July birthday. I took my son to the doctor and told them what the school wanted to do she tested him and then started him on the Metadate. I could tell a difference on the first pill. He has made straight A&#039;s every since. Now that he can focus and sit still he is the first one done with his work and the teachers have decided to test him for the Gifted program.""",1
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""For GAD I take 10mg once a day in the afternoon currently.  I&#039;ve been on this dose for approx 2 months and the only side effect is bad lightheaded slightly dizzy feeling approx 30 minutes after taking it which lasts for 30min to 1 hour.  I was hoping it would go away after taking it for awhile but the dizziness comes on like clockwork after taking it.  It greatly helps my anxiety in the evening after taking it but my anxiety returns mid morning.  I&#039;m not sure I could take a morning dose because of the side effect of being light headed for awhile.  If I could get past the dizziness this medication causes and get to a 10mg 2x a day I think it would greatly improve my GAD 24x7.""",7
Clonidine,ADHD,"""I have a 8 year old son with ADHD. He is extremely hyper and unable to focus, school and friends became a true nightmare. We see a wonderful and highly respected psychiatrist. He is very knowledgeable on ADHD medicines. I was told when their is an emotional factor to the ADHD, Clonidine is the best medication for this. We tried Clonidine after MANY stimulants and non-stimulants also anti-psychotics. Clonidine 1.0 mg 2x a day this was the only medicine that we saw immediate results with. The only side effect was the tiredness, which did go away. I started him on the Kapavy 2 weeks ago. This medicine is a true GOD send. He is calm, focused, and far less emotional. We can&#039;t say enough great things. Please give this medicine a try.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I wanna start by saying I have battled w acne for years &amp; tried basically everything money could buy - pills to creams, going to specialists doctors, derms, beauty bars, etc. I went off the pill at 27 &amp; thought my acne was done but had the worst flare up ever. Tried spironolactone which helped a tiny bit w oil but it was still so bad. Cysts under the skin, blackheads, acne on my back or chest, it was so embarrassing. 

 I am going on my third month of accutane &amp; it&#039;s been a miracle I feel like I could cry. My skin clear/smooth &amp; people tell me I&#039;m glowing. I still have scars all over that will need to heal &amp; my skin can get hella dry--well everything gets dry bc you are super dehydrated but it is DEF WORTH IT.""",4
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Cymbalta for about 10 months now.  At first the side effects were difficult because I felt nauseous, dizzy, had brain zaps, constipation, and my dreams were crazy.  Luckily I did not quit within the first 2 weeks and the side effects mostly subsided.  Cymbalta has really helped with my anxiety and depression.  I was on 30mg then 60mg.  The first couple months were the best with no anxiety at all but slowly it started to come back. My dose has just been raised to 90mg and am also on Wellbutrin.  Not perfect and I don&#039;t want to keep raising the dose but Cymbalta has really improved my daily life and relationships with others.""",7
Victoza,Weight Loss,"""I started to take Victoza 0.6 mg for weight loss, three weeks ago. After jumping through several hoops with insurance to cover the med, I was hopeful and excited to start this med and get results. First day was awful; headache, fatigue as I have never experienced in my life (shoulders/back/neck), nausea (like at sea), dizziness, blurred vision, constipation, GI issues I&#039;ve never experienced before, dry mouth/dehydration, nightmares (when able to sleep) night sweats and insomnia. I tried to stick it out (2 HORRIBLE wks) in the hopes the side effects would subside; they got worse. I ended up passing out; hot/cold clammy sweats as if hypoglycemic, yet was not (140). I was taken by ambulance to the ED where I was given 2L fluids... BEWARE!""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Lamotrigine for 3 months for treatment on Rapid Cycling Bipolar II.  I&#039;m currently on 150 mg. This medicine has been amazing.  I tried Wellbutrin - which made me full of rage and even violent and Abilify - which made me excessively more impulsive (gambling, drinking, smoking - all of which I would normally not do).
Lamotrigine has been a God-send.  The cycling has slowed to a near halt.  I have a few mild down cycles, but they are few and far between and subside quickly.  I have been able to concentrate better.  It has even had the pleasant side-effect of helping to reduce my anxiety. The only negative side effects for me are nausea for the first few days and intense headaches for the first week after increased dosages.""",6
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have been on Implanon for nearly two and a half years now.  I had been on the Depo before that for about five years.  My biggest concern was not getting my period because that was the whole reason I was originally put on birth control.  I essentially cannot function when I get my period and with the Implanon I have not gotten it once.  I gained a lot of weight on the Depo, but once on Implanon I lost 20lbs. Although I was exercising regularly as well.  The only negative side effect I&#039;ve experienced is a lowered sex drive.  Other than that I love this birth control.  I think people just need to realize that different bodies respond differently to medications.""",8
Victoza,Obesity,"""I&#039;m very tall and very overweight. Six months on a controlled diet and exercise program yielded no results. My doctor put me on Victoza, suspecting some sort of metabolism issue (fasting blood sugar was a constant 101 for several years). Starting dose of 0.6 gave me a 20 minute headache each morning and left me lethargic. It got better in a week, upped to 1.2, same thing started. 20 minute headache, no energy. Again, it got better each day. Hit maintenance level of 1.8 and the weight began pouring off me at roughly a pound a day! A very effective appetite suppressant and my fasting blood sugar averages 91 now.""",2
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I have been off and on this medication this last time due to losing insurance and couldn&#039;t afford it.  I got my insurance back and happily my insurance pays for it and only a copay of $10.  Yes the first few days I have a headache so I slowly start taking it then once I&#039;m used to it I started them twice a day.  I love this medicine.  It curbs my appetite and the one month I have been using lost 5 lbs.  I have to make myself eat sometimes.  I have knee problems and this has helped me to lose the weight since I can no longer work out like I used to.""",3
Accutane,Acne,"""Oh, thank you, God!  I am now a 48 year old female, and I developed acne at 13 years old.  Absolutely nothing worked for my acne or my TREMENDOUSLY oily skin.  My life was very different from other kids&#039; lives that had normal skin.  I started Accutane at 20, and I&#039;ve had to repeat the medication about every 13 years.  I strongly recommend Accutane, 6 months on 40 mg, and am very happy with my results. Good luck to everyone!""",4
Duragesic,Pain,"""I have been all the way up to 150-200 mg with 30 mg breakthru.  I really had a life then but wasn&#039;t really &quot;there&quot;.   I couldn&#039;t find any doctor in my area to presribe fentenyl so all I got was 15mg oxycodone and that&#039;s it. I have a 30 degree curve in back, left hip damage, Crohn&#039;s disease and now colon cancer.  I&#039;m back on them but only at 50 mg every 72 hours.   It&#039;s a joke.  The DEA here is cruel to people that truly need it.   Tolerance included, I don&#039;t absorb oral meds but do receive very few 15&#039;s for break thru.  I am waiting for a pain pump once my colon is removed but can I make it?  I&#039;m angry, depressed and want to just sleep without screaming.""",9
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I started this medication over 2 weeks ago and I have lost 12lbs. The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced are occasional headaches here and there, but Advil cleared that up. Changed my diet and definitely not having cravings any more,  so much that my boyfriend bought me a donut and I told him no thanks!  Super proud of myself.  Can&#039;t wait to see my results after a couple of months,  have to lose 40 lbs in total.""",3
Zoloft,Depression,"""My doctor prescribed this for depression issues/severe anxiety associated with adult ADD. I was very resistant to try, have been put on multiple other meds that made things much worse. I take 50mg daily. Immediately felt almost &quot;euphoric.&quot; With each passing day, I feel better in every sense, and the anxiety is gone. I NEVER write any posts EVER, but this has been an unbelievable game changer. I have been battling these issues since childhood, and I can truly say I feel happy and hopeful about my future. The &quot;internal storm&quot; inside that I battled every day to cope with is gone. No side effects except for some vivid, strange dreams-but those are dissipating. I hope this helps someone-if this one doesn&#039;t help, keep trying and never give up.""",5
Effexor XR,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Effexor XR for about 9 years now (150mg once a day). I originally started taking it for A.D.D. and mild depression. It has worked incredibly for me. I went from no attention span to extremely focused. I also went through some events that increased my depression, and by upping the dosage, I was fine. The only side effects I&#039;ve had are extreme withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose (severe headaches and jitters), and a decreased sex drive. I would strongly recommend this drug.""",5
Niacin,Depression,"""I&#039;m so excited how niacin has changed my life.. I&#039;ve suffered from depression and anxiety attacks for years. It started when I was 7th grade.. I&#039;m now 62yr old and been through many drugs and doctors.. When I decided to try niacin it was the last straw for me. With the help and support of my daughter she insisted for me to give it a try. She is taking classes to become  nutritionist and came across info on this supplement called niacin and read great testimonies.  So I took her advice and began to take it. I&#039;m so amazed how it has lifted my depression, anxiety, and unwanted fear. I feel like a new person, confident , happy and wanting to endeavor in new activities.. Nothing is holding me back!! There is hope for me now..""",5
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on Abilify for just over 2 years. At first I was started at 5mg, then increased to 10mg and finally upped to 15mg.

At 15mg the psychotic symptoms vanished, and it prevented almost all manic episodes. It did nothing for my depressive symptoms though. 

I also developed terrible akathisia within a few months of reaching 15mg, and they didn&#039;t stop when we briefly tried going back down to 10mg. My legs bounced up and down every minute I was awake, I rocked backwards and forwards, I paced and one of my arms even trembled too. I couldn&#039;t read, eat with a knife and fork, and strangers would give me funny looks. I had akathisia for two years.

Other than that I had no other side effects with this drug. No weight gain or tiredness.""",6
Ativan,Anxiety,"""Ativan has made a tremendous difference in my life as my anxiety was out of control and panic attacks were frequent. I don&#039;t find that it makes me tired and I like how the effects are quickly felt. I used to take 1 mg but now only take 0.5mg once a day; twice if I need it. I can skip days the odd time if I am at home and things are peaceful.  I was put on Valium and couldn&#039;t handle that at all - Ativan was a lifesaver for me!""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""2 days taking phentermine 37.5 and I feel great. I am 5&#039;10 and 40 years old- starting weight 224.8 and two days later I at 218.0lbs. I&#039;m under doctors care while taking these and she has me taking them for 2 months maybe 3. The only side effects for me is dry mouth and the first day taking them a little blurry vision only lasting 1 min. My appetite has completely vanished and its easy making the right food choices.  My goal weight is around 170.  I have a very positive outlook now that I can do this and will start exercising 3 days a week.""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""I just started Celexa when my doctor put me on it about a week ago. We just couldn&#039;t win with my depression and all that entails for major depressive disorder, and I was feeling really depressed at the time. I&#039;m on a low dose but only for about two weeks until we check it out. I&#039;ve been diagnosed now for about 8 or 9 years, tried LOTS of anti-depressants. Even though I tried to work with them all, as a team me and the medicine, we just couldn&#039;t win with it the depression. My side effects of depression are a huge lack of energy, being angry often, usually at the whole world, so much stress and negativity, So much that I will say thanks to everyone who commented. I hope I have a lot to look forward to now based on all of the positive comments about Celexa.""",5
Minocycline,Acne,"""I had a very good experience with this medication, and I took it for close to 3 years with a 6 month break in between the last 2 years. Unfortunately, I developed a skin rash that would raise if anyone brushed up against me and my skin would raise if I was scratched. I developed yeast issues and eventually had to get off minocycline because while it was curing my acne, it was giving me other health issues. My suggestion is to switch medications monthly because it worked for my acne when I used it!""",4
Ambien CR,Insomnia,"""I just started using Ambien CR and like most of the people i was scared to take it because of all of these weird side effects that people experience but thank GOD it worked on me just fine. My doctor was gentle to me and she prescribed only 5mg and I must say it worked like a charm. I took it and half hour later (maybe even less) I was deep in sleep. I did sleep close to 5 hours and I must say I don&#039;t remember the last time I was feeling so refreshed and so rested. Other medicines I&#039;ve tried put me asleep but when I would wake up I would feel so groggy. I&#039;m finally happy to say that I found a medicine that works for me.""",0
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""Worst antidepressant out there. Ruined my life.
I took 5 mg for a week, then 10mg for 2 weeks, gone up to 15mg but couldn&#039;t persist because of unbearable itching so went back to 10mg for another three weeks. I stopped taking it because it was completely unhelpful, all in all - 1.5 months with this drug. 
When I quit it I began experiencing withdrawal symptoms: Brain zaps, muscle twitches, tight muscles, extreme agitation and restlessness, no focus or concentration, loss of memory.
I&#039;m writing this review almost a year after quitting this drug(!) and still the symptoms persist. I think that it caused permanent brain damage.
If you&#039;ve been hurt by this drug like me, spread the word! 
If you&#039;re considering taking it, STAY AWAY!""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am excited about this healthy journey. I started taking Contrave Monday 24th (183lbs) , went back to the doctor Saturday29th (179lbs). So yes it is working for me 4lbs down and 3lbs of fat gone! I have not had any side effects and I pray it skips me... My goal is to be 160lbs by 11/21 if I lose more that will be terrific! However, I know it&#039;s not a quick fix more of  a lifestyle change which is why I am a pescatarian and loving it. I believe if you do your part (no junk, soda, or bad carbs)  Contrave will do the rest. 

What makes it more worth the try was the cost. I use the coupon which discounted it to 90.00 plus my insurance covered it so I only paid 40.00 for a 30-day supply.""",2
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I took Doxylamine for the first time last night. I have suffered terribly from opioid withdrawal induced insomnia for a long period of time and to sleep I was given Seroquel, which did not help but left me completely &quot;hangovered&quot; in the mornings and had serious side effects. Instead, I tried the OTC Doxylamine and I have slept seven straight hours without nightmares and feel great and wide awake in the morning. I can not generalize after only one experience but would really like to recommend it.""",0
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I had been suffering from pretty severe anxiety and sleeplessness. I would usually be able to fall asleep but would then wake up 1-4 hours later and never be able to fall back asleep.  I start Zoloft (50, then 100, now 150mg) a little over a month ago and my anxiety is basically gone.  In conjunction with that I started taking Seroquel at the same time for sleep and it has been wonderful.  I started out taking 50mg but am now taking 100mg a night about 30-45 minutes before bed.

Within about a half hour I feel incredibly tired and relaxed, it&#039;s wonderful.  For whatever reason this medication does give me the munchies to watch out for that.  After a couple weeks on the medication I no longer feel drowsy in the morning which is great!""",0
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""3 months 200 mg at night.

This medicine has helped me be in control of my thoughts. Before starting Quetiapine, I was struggling a lot with depression, and on the flip side racing thoughts and overactivity.  Had a failed and bad experience with SSRI-antidepressants. 

+ Helps limit your brain activity to normal parameters. 
+ Makes you sleep sound
+ Let&acute;s you concentrate on what you want.

- Weight gain
- Hangover tiredness the next day. 
- Subtle antidepressant effect. It is more a mood stabiliser in my experience.

All in all it does the job, and it can be invaluable when looking back at one&acute;s life.""",6
Ativan,Anxiety,"""Initially, I was prescribed Ativan for anxiety related to menopause. I took 0.25 mg every few days for that. Then, after a death in my immediate family, I began taking 0.25 to 0.5 mg almost every afternoon.  My prescription reads &quot;1 mg up to 3 x daily as needed&quot;.  I have never needed more than 0.5 mg a day. I have not felt the need to increase beyond that dose. Ativan helps me think clearly and removes the stress that is pretty prevalent in my life at the moment. It also allows me to rest at night.""",7
Armodafinil,ADHD,"""I went undiagnosed with severe ADHD for 20 years because another problem was complicating the diagnosis.  I had been taking various energy drinks in an effort to concentrate.  Just a few days ago, I was given a prescription for Nuvigil.  

Wow.  This stuff hit me like a mac truck! It was unlike anything I have ever experienced.  For once, I actually had the drive and motivation to organize things and get things done.  

I immediately proceeded to straighten every single thing in my room, down to the last bits of lint on the carpet.

I like the new me.  I hope it lasts.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""This drug is the best. I&#039;ve taken it twice stubborn acne keeps on coming back.. That&#039;s the only thing, but to others it never comes back. I want to go on it again to get cleared up again.. I just started this birth control called the implanon and I think that it makes my acne worse.. I don&#039;t have big pimples, small looking ones that are annoying..I also have a lot of whiteheads because my skin is so oily.. I&#039;m going to make an appointment soon.. Accutane works really well.. It clears ur skin like no other..""",4
Adapalene,Acne,"""I only started using differin a week ago. It has made my skin very red like in the first 3 days I got a red rash-like thing below my lips and on my cheeks and it burns. It also has made around my eyes very dry. I am going to start using it every second day for my skin to get used to it but I really hope that it will work. Just give it time people and don&#039;t over use or get worried if your skin becomes red because that is a side effect if you have sensitive skin.""",4
Cariprazine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started to take vraylar 1.5 mg about two weeks ago and at first I noticed right away I just felt better, my mood was up, I had a sense of humor again but about a week ago I started to have problems with my binge eating again and even though I feel ok I can&#039;t seem to stop eating this makes me feel very out of control and sad.  The last three days I haven&#039;t been able to sleep I can&#039;t focus my thoughts I don&#039;t feel good any more.  I&#039;m hoping to go off vraylar today or tomorrow after I talk to my doctor.""",6
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""My 11.5yr old is on 20mg of amitriptyline at bedtime for peripheral neuropathic pain in the ball of her foot.  We started on 10mg and had no effect after 1month on sleep or pain levels.  20mg has reduced pain by 15% and increased her sleep. (only waking once a night instead of 3 times).  Pain levels are still at 6.5/10 on her scale (we she has a high pain threshold as she has broken her wrist a couple of times).  She is a well build 11yrs old and not experiencing any side effects.  Our consultants are anti-medication so not keen on her taking any dose. Does anyone have any guidance on dose rate - From what I have read, we could easily up her to 25/30mg and see whether this has any further effect....clearly the 20mg is doing something?""",9
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""What started as a gallbladder removal July 2016 after being sick for 4 months &amp; weight packing on somehow they discovered I had papillary thyroid cancer. I underwent a full thyroid removal Oct 2016, then a umbilical cord hernia surgery Jan 2017, radiation for the cancer Feb 2017. My diet has been mostly Sprite, oats, strawberries and occasional premade Bob Evans Mashed Potatoes. The weight still kept adding on to me. My cancer/endo doctor added Qsymia to my Thyroid med. Since I started March 15 I have lost 21 lbs. I am not able to work out as I still have a sliding Hiatal hernia I am waiting on surgery for along with another medical issue the medicine does not effect. 48 Year old Female 5&#039;2 want to lose 25 more.""",3
Retin-A,Acne,"""I&#039;m 16 years old. I&#039;m a boy who suffers moderate acne. I have blemishes of previous acne. The down side is that I&#039;m really white. I&#039;ve been on retin a since september 1st. I&#039;m on week 5 or 6 but my face is getting better. Acne decreasing much more. I still have the red blemishes and marks on my cheeks but I&#039;m excited to see the result people say they see in 3-6 months. I&#039;m prescribed clindamycin phosphate and antibiotic pills with cetaphil wash. I use retin a at night and then moisterize 30minutes after then apply clinda. when I go to sleep. So stick to this cream the white heads and stuff will suck but my acne bumps/marks are slowly disappearing even though they are still visible. Can&#039;t wait till I can clear up an feel happy""",4
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I was put on Mirtazapine by my doctor recently and the side effects of it were horrendous. Slept for hours on end, when I did get up I was living through a fog. I couldn&#039;t function on a day to day basis. The nightmares were awful, vivid very scary dreams that I couldn&#039;t force myself to wake from so I decided enough. I had been on citalopram before that and it was no longer helping so I was switched to the mirtazapine. I went back on Prozac and in less than a week I feel better, my head is clear and I can do things I enjoy. I don&#039;t sleep well anyway so the Prozac has no effect on that. I will stick with the Prozac.""",5
Lexapro,Depression,"""Have MDNOS/possibly Bipolar. Went on Lamictal about 5 years ago which saved my life (awful, terrible mood swings). Was still fairly down so added Celexa after 1 year. This helped but after 2 years it lost efficacy. Switched to Lexapro 18 months ago to combat that and it worked for a while. But the side effects have gotten worse. After  6 months taking it my libido started decreasing and now it is literally gone. I get &quot;high&quot; when I take it then crash and feel like a zombie until I take it again. I have no motivation at work, can&#039;t stay focused, restless, can&#039;t just sit and be content, no emotion. Unless I&#039;m depressed or pissed. It&#039;s not worth it. My new doctor is weaning me off it, thank god, here&#039;s hoping I come out okay on the other side.""",5
Nucynta,Pain,"""It seemed okay. I was more alert than when using oxycodone. After three weeks, the side effects outweigh the positives. It was more psychotic than I had planned. After the 75 mg dose wore off, the drop off was steep. I felt very agitated and somewhat aggressive. Similar to prescribed amphetamine or steroid. It makes me so agitated that I have decided to go back to the Oxy. I also experienced some respiratory distress and diminished vision. Good try as an alternative but it is not for me. Kadian had similar reactions.""",9
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Qsymia in November 2012. I tipped the beams at 264lbs, by July I was down to 199lbs and had a heart attack!  Don&#039;t be alarmed, the doctors all said it was nothing to do with the medication. It was a blockage due to all the crap I had ingested over the years. I&#039;m still currently taking Qsymia still at 200 lbs. I&#039;m not exercising like I was and I can eat anything I like in moderation. I feel great, dropped 4 pant sizes and 2 shirt sizes. With no side effects after the first couple weeks. So does it work??? YES... But it&#039;s expensive!""",3
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have been taking 150 mg of trazadone to help me sleep for over five years now and it is wonderful.  My only complaint is that I am a little groggy when I wake up.  A couple of years before I started the 150 mg dose, my doc gave me the standard 50mg dose and it did help me at all.  My main complaint was that once I fell asleep, I would wake and not be able to go back to sleep.  Trazadone solves this problem - it doesn&#039;t knock me out so I will wake to any noise or to use the bathroom but I am able to fall back asleep with no problem.""",0
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I have taken Lunesta 3mg for about 5 years now.  Never have had bad dreams or any instances of sleepwalking, etc.  I take it &amp; about 45 minutes later I am fast asleep until my alarm clock goes off.  Prior to finding Lunesta, I had insomnia for years &amp; I cannot tell you how much of a lifesaver this medicine has been!  Tried Ambien but it did not work for me at all.  Also tried Sonata, but would wake up a few hours after going to sleep.  I&#039;ve had no problems with tolerance, either.  The only &quot;bad&quot; thing is the crappy taste in one&#039;s mouth, but I discovered that brushing my tongue when I brush my teeth before going to bed gets rid of 90% of it, along with using Biotene mouthwash (the dry mouth brand).  Hooray!  My insurance will now cover it, too!""",0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have been on the Mirena for 10 months now. I am going to take it out as soon as possible. The cramping has indeed gotten worse and I bleed at very odd times; sometimes very heavily with clotting and sometimes lightly. It interrupts sexual activity from the bleeding and I run back and forth to the doctor because I can never find it. Honestly, it was good in the beginning, but I feel like these symptoms should be gone by now. Just goes to show everything isn&#039;t for everyone.""",8
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking lamictal for my unspecified bipolar disorder a few weeks ago. The results have been remarkable, I could feel the medication start work a few hours after the first dose and it was definitely more than just a placebo effect. I was less flighty and everything just seemed brighter and clearer. My thinking has cleared up and my mood is well controlled even while traveling, which is when hypomania usually sets in for me.""",6
Pristiq,Depression,"""MY PCP prescribed pristiq for my depression, anxiety, mood issues etc. He told me that the drug takes a few weeks before you could see a difference but I feel like I experienced everything the first day I took the drug. Although my mood and energy improved and felt better overall the side effects were so severe I decided to discontinue after the first day. My side effects started with heart palpitations, sweating, dizziness and a faint feeling. This later subsided but turned into nausea and loss of appetite I couldn&#039;t eat anything that day and even water made me gag. That night I slept for a total of 3 hours I couldn&#039;t stay asleep and the time I did fall asleep it felt like I wasn&#039;t asleep at all. My body felt numb and my heart was racing.""",5
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I have been on Ambien for about 8 months but I had started to become tolerant to it.  Sometimes I would take it and it would knock me out other times I can take it and still be wide awake until 4am.  My doctor recommended that I try Ambien CR but my insurance won&#039;t approve it until I&#039;ve tried Lunesta.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!  It literally had no effect on me whatsoever.  Tylenol PM would have done a better job!  I followed the instructions to the tee, didn&#039;t eat a fatty meal and took it on an empty stomach.  Has anyone else had this result?  I need to switch back to Ambien!""",0
Accutane,Acne,"""In the first month I broke out with the worst acne I&#039;ve ever experienced (large and painful). The second month progressed to smaller acne occurring but my skin became very dry, especially my lips. Chapstick has to be applied about every 20 minutes. There were rashes on my forearms from a reaction that looked like poison ivy and felt like eczema. The third month is where I noticed my pores began to shrink. There are no more large breakouts, just minor acne when it decides to show. Now I am in my fourth month and there are very few break outs and in their own area; no clusters of breakouts. Overall Accutane is a great product for severe acne and it can change anyone&#039;s life, but the side effects are serious and patients need to be safe!""",4
Doxepin,Depression,"""I was prescribed doxepin by my Dr and was not given any informed consent regarding side effects or interactions. I am shocked that I had so many side effects almost instantly, very dangerous medication and I am sorry that I ever followed my Drs advice. I would be very careful with this med and any med that you put into your body. I wonder if the CEO of the company that invented this would let their children take it?!""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m sure everyone experiences Skyla differently, but for me it was absolutely the worst. I didn&#039;t have any problems with insertion (quick intense pinch but nothing unbearable). I didn&#039;t even take any pain meds before. Yes, I had cramps the rest of the day, but I was so excited to get off the pill I didn&#039;t care. Unfortunately what followed was 7 months of continual bleeding with less than 15 non-bleeding or spotting days that entire time. I also had frequent cramps despite never having period cramps before. My doc told me to wait it out until the six month mark, but the bleeding days never stopped. Just had it removed yesterday and immediately felt relieved. I was told I&#039;d have a week of withdrawal bleeding, but I&#039;m just happy it&#039;s gone.""",8
Saxenda,Obesity,"""REDBOXES -Week two done, down 9lbs in all.  Did no exercise this week due to sickness.  Rested and slept all week.  Still on .6 and have no cravings and I am in full control of what I am eating.  No side effects now.  I trying to keep my calories up to 1200 per day.  The reason I am not increasing my dose is that I have to pay out of pocket for the whole thing.  This is helping me loose weight and if I don&#039;t put the dose up it will save me a ton of money.""",2
Lortab,Pain,"""I am a young (22 year-old) female who has bursitis in my right hip. I&#039;m anteriorally rotated, and have a gluteal strain, so it doesn&#039;t help my hip.  Physical therapy has significantly helped, but my hip pops every step I take, and often pops out of place. Again despite the physical therapy, the pain sometimes becomes unbearable. I have tried about 4 different drugs before Lortab. Lortab is the only medicine that eases the severe pain (when I&#039;m between 8 and 10 on the pain scale). It is not to take for every day, but it is AMAZING.  For me, the downside, which I have heard from many people, is that it can leave you feeling anxious, and I generally can&#039;t sleep if I take Lortab.  I think the benefits far outweigh the negative.""",9
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got this implant November 20 of 2016. At first my periods were irregular and had spotting in between, had lower back pain and mood swings/depression. My periods went away which is amazing but the depression has gotten worse and I now have cystic acne all along my chin, cheeks forehead, and all over my hairline. I&#039;ve dealt with acne all my life and I finally had it under control so this implant causing my skin to break out in painful cysts is a deal breaker. I am sad to get it removed because it is a convenience that I don&#039;t have to take a pill everyday, did not gain weight off of it and it took my periods away. But my skin is more important to me.""",8
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 26, just celebrated my 1 year anniversary with my Mirena. I remember like if it was yesterday when I had it inserted. It was a very, very painful 30 seconds. My doctor said it would only be a pinch...ah definitely not JUST a pinch. It wasn&#039;t that my doctor did anything thing wrong, my doctor is the best, I just was not ready, or expected that kinda of pain. I luckily had taken two days off so I rested and I did have painful cramps. I was spotty for about a week after that.  Cramps are pretty bad but it beats worrying about being pregnant. Even though the insertion was painful, ladies I strongly recommend it to every woman who wants a reliable birth control.""",8
Kapvay,ADHD,"""My 7 year old daughter has been on Concerta 18mg for a year.  She started to tolerate that medicine, but I did not want to increase the dosage.  My doctor recommend we add Kapvay to her current concerta dose.  This has made all the difference.  She is no longer bouncing off the walls, jumping on the couch, or leaving half way through a meal.  She is engaged, focused and less moody.  Her emotions are more regulated and we did not tell her teacher but she even commented on the change without us sharing the news.  We are so happy, and this medicine is worth the time it takes to condition to the sleepiness that happens in the initial 2 weeks.  Hope the changes stay.""",1
Vicoprofen,Pain,"""Vicoprofen was prescribed to me after a Laparoscopy (removed ovarian cyst) I hardly felt anything at all.  I only need to take it about once every 12 hours.  Please eat first.  I was lightheaded and confused after taking it once on an empty stomach.  Also, don&#039;t drink alcohol.  My surgery was a few days before Thanksgiving and I had a glass of wine and felt sick to my stomach all night through the next day.  Never make that mistake again. Overall the medication was good. Like I said, I felt nothing after taking the pill.""",9
Topamax,Obesity,"""After getting a blistering skin rash from Lamictal, Topamax was prescribed.  It did decrease my appetite- I went from 209 lbs back to my regular 135 which I hadn&#039;t been in 7 years. This took place in about 10 months.  At abt the same time I started taking it, I was rearended and suffered a MTBI and scored very low on my neuropsych exam. My old psychiatrist retired and the new psychiatrist is against Topamax bc of the &quot;foggy&quot; side effects that are common.  Now, a little over a year later, I feel ok abt this med considering the alternatives- wish there were better alternatives!""",2
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My 8 y.o. was prescribed this medication to help with her aggression and hyperactivity. It did not help her, at all. I feel she had actually gotten a little worse while taking it. She had a lot of trouble falling asleep.. she would wide awake at midnight, when 1am some nights. Besides the trouble sleeping issue, she only seemed to experience one other side effect, which was nausea, but only on the first night. I gave it one month and then told her Psychiatrist that it wasn&#039;t for her.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""My initial weigh in was 175.0lbs and I am 5&#039; 7&quot;.  I have been on oral steroids for a herniated disc for almost a year.  Then new scans revealed two herniated disc, arthritis, and degenerative disc disease that now I am having steroid injections.   Well with all of these steroids I have put on a hefty 35lbs.  I was prescribed Phentermine 37.5mg for three months on 4/20/15.  I began taking them on 4/21/15 and with a combination of no appetite,  watching what I do eat, exercising...  I have lost 5.5lbs in five days!  I can&#039;t wait to get my old self back!  Hope everyone is doing just as well!""",3
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""Ok, I hit my one month mark as of today, I have lost 10 pounds, with very little effort. This medication is amazing. I am still not having any negative side effects, and my cravings and hunger are a thing of the past. This stuff is great! I am at 163.5lbs now, so I have about 30 more pounds to go, hopefully I can keep the 10 pounds a month fade going, then I can get off the medicine and continue eating healthy small meals. I hope everyone is having the same success! Best of luck.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""So I have always struggled with my weight, I am either trying to loose weight or gaining it....there is never an steady weight for me. I feel like I can loose weight rather quickly if I give up 100% of my mindset on it, but the downside of that is I also gain just as quickly. Now that I am in my late 30&#039;s the extra weight is now effecting my health causing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, very low self esteem, and complete misery. I love clothes, but never even want to get dressed anymore because I am uncomfortable and can&#039;t wear what I love. I am to the point that the extra weight is changing my once outgoing, bubbly personality into a shy, quiet girl because I am uncomfortable in my skin. I hope this helps! I need it badly.""",3
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My son has been on several different ADHD medications.  He had been on one for a couple years and it wasn&#039;t having the effect it should after so long, so they changed him to Daytrana.  He was so out of control on this medication.  It actually seemed to make his impulse issues and attention worse. We discontinued the patch after the 2nd week.  Hopefully it&#039;s positive for others, just definitely not the one for my son.""",1
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Geodon for three and half years. I take 20 mg spread out over 5 to 6 times a day in combination with Wellbutrin. I have lost almost 90 lbs which I had put on from previous Abilify use. It really keeps my mood stable and I have been able to keep a job and participate in life. The most bothersome side effects I have found are getting light headed easily and when my dose wears off everything moves at a very fast pace. I have tried other medications for bipolar but this really helps the most.""",6
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I wanted  a birth control that I wouldn&#039;t have to make monthly appointments or worry about pregnancy (after having my 2nd baby  unexpectedly). It definitely does give hormonal issues, mental and physical I pushed thru those issues for about 2 years into getting it and finally started getting control over it. I did have to see a dr and get the anxiety and depression sorted, which I think went along with untreated post partum depression for both of my girls. My periods come and go as they please. Never really have cramps. Just get uncomfortable and the regular period symptoms. Would have a period for 1 week then none for a month and a half-2months If I went 2 months without then I&#039;d have it for 1 week spot for a day or so then had it another 4 days""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started Contrave at my doctors request on Jan 14th at 224 pounds. This morning I was 215. I&#039;ve had virtually no side effects. My doctor said to lose 8 pounds per month, and I&#039;ve lost 9 pounds in just short of a month. I&#039;ve noticed that drinking lots of water, and spacing out meals and snacks has kept the nausea at bay. I take my 1st dose at 6:30 am with my breakfast. I eat a piece of fruit at 10:30, lunch around 1:30, a Fiber One snack at 3ish, then dinner around 6 with my second dose. High protein snacks have really helped a lot.""",2
Adapalene,Acne,"""I had moderate-severe acne when I hit 21. It was a very tormenting stage for me, having this kind of acne. I can&#039;t go outdoors without wearing foundation/concealer to cover up redness. My self confidence was low. Finally, I went to the dermatologist, she prescribed oral and topical treatment. I stopped taking oral antibiotics because I read that it&#039;s not good for the body. So I only maintained adapalene ge. I think adapalene helps a lot because it minimized the growth of occurring acne as well as clearing my skin. I use bp sparingly to avoid irritation and rash. Though, adapalene slowly works and it takes months to see improvements, I didn&#039;t experience flaking or stinging from it. I hope to see more improvements on my face while on it.""",4
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""My Dr. switched me from Risperidone to Geodon because of weight gain. I had taken Geodon back in 2002 and didn&#039;t have any side effects that I can recall.  However this time it was a nightmare. As soon as I started taking it I felt sick. The side effects I experienced: Sore throat, cough, sore throat glands, restlessness, acid indigestion, heartburn, belching, depression, rash on my neck, loss of appetite, back pain, joint pain, flatulence, hot flashes, insomnia, unable to stay asleep, exhausted. I was on it for 2 1/2 weeks. My Dr. told me to stop cold turkey. The withdrawal was hell.  I was dizzy for a week, hot flashes, chills, shaking, nauseous, vomiting, terrible spasms in my thighs. It took about 8 days for me to feel better.""",6
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""My mom died when I was 4 and last semester I always had anxiety in the background and now at 15, spring semester of &#039;08 I had some mild panic attacks and worry, nervousness, sadness and excessive shyness all day long. This medication is a life saver and I love it. They say 8 weeks for the full effect and sure it might re-balance your chemicals in 8 weeks, but give it a chance as it still takes a while after that for you to break out of your shell.""",7
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I was put on Amitriptyline 25mg. at Mayo Clinic in 1983. After a through work up they thought I had MS, but then gave  the diagnosis of Neuropathy pain.
At this time I&#039;m taking 50mg. @ bed time, which has been the only thing that works. I&#039;m able to sleep w/o pain. Now I just tried to refill the prescription and the cost is $219.00 for 180 pills. The last time filled 12/2014 $16.00/180 pills. 
Even tho this is a Generic why the higher cost??
Just can&#039;t afford it anymore. Don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to do. Have tried Tegratol, Cymbalta  and many others, NOTHING ELSE WORKS.""",9
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Best med for those who suffer from constant anxiety. It helps me a lot with my social anxiety in particular. I take 1 mg 3x daily. Been on that dosage for 2 years now. Have had no bad side effects. This drug has been a lifesaver for me. I&#039;ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I think I will probably be on this med for life. Never stop taking it cold turkey or you will go through a nasty withdrawal. It happened to me once several years ago when the doctor suddenly had me stop it with no warning or taper schedule.  It&#039;s best to slowly taper off.""",7
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I live in Ireland, coming from the States. I&#039;ve had 2 lumbar disectomies, which both left me with the same intense pain, have osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. I have noticed a difference being only on them for a week. My pain is far from being gone but, knocks it down to about a 5, where I can meditate and relax and not laying in bed or sofa waiting for night to come to go to bed.  I am hoping with more time, this will be a God send since I am allergic to 99% of the medicine here.  Only negative is I get a mild headache, but fingers crossed!""",9
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""Woman of Cuban and Puerto Rican heritage 5&#039;1 and 179 pounds. I wish I could say this was genetic but I just always seemed to be famished and liked my sweets. I have seven months experience and am 43 pounds lighter. I started with diet but once the pound came off I got excited and started biking after the first month to speed things up. Side effects few headache and I was tired initially. Now I sleep easily and don&#039;t get tempted by pretty much anything.""",2
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I have been taking Saxenda since July 2016.  I had severe nausea for about a month once I got up to the 2.6 dosage.  It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don&#039;t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.  When this started I could barely walk the length of myself without getting winded - I have lost 58 lbs so far.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m 24 years old, I have Hashimoto&#039;s (hypothyroid) and am 5&#039;5. I weighed in at 217 lbs on March 25th which is the day I started the medication. It&#039;s been seven days and today I am weighing in at 204, 13 lb loss. I&#039;ve been primarily juicing all three meals per day. I had a full meal one weekend night and have had healthy snacks here and there such as raw almonds and avocados. I&#039;ve been drinking about 1 gallon of water per day. I just worked out for the first time on day 6 so we&#039;ll see how my second week goes now that I&#039;m burning more calories. No negative side effects, dry mouth occurs but as previously stated by everyone it&#039;s just makes the water intake that much easier.""",3
Differin,Acne,"""I&#039;m currently on my 5th week of Differin. Things aren&#039;t looking up. I&#039;m in college and I&#039;m currently interning before I get into med school - this means everyday practical exams and everyday patient evaluation. I&#039;ve lost all my self esteem - I wish I never went on Differin in the first place. Should I stop it? I was said it took 6-12 weeks to see results, and improvement right after the first month. That never happened and honestly, I no longer want to return to my dermatologist. It was an absolute waste of money and time.  My face is exploding with cysts, especially on my nose. And I hate seeing my patients like this. What should I do?""",4
Elavil,Insomnia,"""I told my doctor about my symptoms and he told me that my symptoms did not appear in his medical handbook so he disregarded my symptoms completely. He said it was mandatory for him to report any symptom not listed in his book to the proper health authorities to update the handbook. However, he didn&#039;t report the side effects that I told him about because it was &quot;too much paperwork.&quot; Instead, he tried to convince me that it had nothing to do with Elavil and in a threatening demeanour tried to change my mind about my symptoms so that he would not be forced to do any paperwork. After reading this site on Elavil, I see the symptoms that I told my doctor about. I find that my doctor acted in an unsafe, unprofessional, and negligent manner.""",0
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""So I&#039;ve been on this birth control about a month now. I was accidentally prescribed this after my doctor failed to put in the correct low dose estrogen birth control I was taking prior.

This pill so far has definitely caused me to gain a few pounds, give me no motivation, and the most insane mood swings I&#039;ve ever experienced on a pill.  I will cry for no reason, and get annoyed and angry at friends or coworkers. I will also get very sad by the littlest things and reach for the phone to call my ex which we all know is not a good decision.  I will stick with this pill for a few more months but if it gets worse I will schedule and appointment to get it changed. 
No headaches though!""",8
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been really pleased with the way vyvanse has helped me. On Vyvanse I&#039;m not moody or lifeless like I had been on other drugs. My appetite is still very small and this is kind of a problem because I&#039;m really light anyways. However, if I eat before I take it and snack on healthy things during school hours I don&#039;t crash when it wears off. With Vyvanse I&#039;ve realized it&#039;s possible to control my ADD and keep my personality! I was VERY nervous about starting a new drug, but Vyvanse is really the best thing I&#039;ve tried and my grades in my AP classes are better than they have ever been.""",1
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m eighteen and I&#039;ve had ADD all my life, though I&#039;m only now trying medication for it.  Daytrana helped me a little, but my dosage was too low.  I started out on the 10mg patch.  The biggest issue with it was weight loss.  Now, let me begin by saying that before the appointment where I was diagnosed, I had just eaten lunch.  Shortly after starting Daytrana, I caught a cold that lasted about two weeks, recovered, then caught another two-week cold.  I did notice that I was less hungry while using the patch.  Didn&#039;t eat breakfast before my checkup,  My weight went from 120 to 114 lbs.  Doctor took me off Daytrana and switched me to Stratera, which has been a nightmare.  While on Daytrana, I felt more awake, but not necessarily more focused.""",1
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had insomnia for 15  years and tried about everything on the market.  The only medicine which helps is 45mg of Temazepam. Lower doses did nothing. However, even that is good for only 4 hours sleep. I have to take them almost 3 hours before bedtime for them to work. There are at least 1/3 of the nights it does nothing.  I have had 3 sleep tests and no apnea has ever been detected. Antidepressants all made insomnia worse with frequent awakenings.

Atralin,Acne,"""Atralin is an amazing ointment for acne prone, sensitive skin. I got a prescription for the topical gel because I was having mild to moderate breakouts and had acne scarring that had occurred before I went on Accutane. My skin is very sensitive, so I needed a mild gel. Every night I put a pea sized amount into my palm, mixed it with a small amount of my facial night cream, dabbed bits of the mixture all over my face and neck and then applied my night cream as usual. At first I was discouraged because I was very consistent with my regime and did not see results for many weeks. Then, after about three months of daily use, my acne and acne scarring began to clear up dramatically. I have not had a blemish in months!""",4
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed Seroquel as a &quot;sleeping pill&quot; for &quot;insomnia&quot;. I recently found out that it is an antipsychotic drug, I felt betrayed.  I did a rapid detox program and they put me on all these medicines when they released me, no wonder this pill didn&#039;t put me to sleep, I can stay up forever after I take it. The only way it helps me sleep is if I take one and a half pills, which is 150 mg, then it puts me to sleep within 30 minutes to an hour, however, my dose is only supposed to be 100 mg swallowed 2 hours before bedtime, but it takes way longer than two hours. I might never go to sleep if I only take one and swallow it rather than chewing it up!""",0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Insertion was quite painful. Cramping, although no bleeding. 
No period at all for the first 6 months. My first period was about 5 days long &amp; very light. 
But I gained 5 lbs since I got it. Food cravings are ridiculous and I recently developed an unbearable odor coming from my cervix. 
Monthly, I&#039;m supposed to check the string to make sure mirena is still in place, and doing so after my first period, there was a thick white discharge that smelled sour and wouldn&#039;t go away even after douching daily. I got myself checked for an infection because it was accompanied by itching when it first started (no multiple partners)  I thought it was a yeast infection, but I was clear; no infection at all. I think the bad outweighs the good for mirena.""",8
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""I started taking paroxetine about 5 years ago because I was lasting 2 mins in bed with my gf.  I never had that problem before but it was happening all the time.  My doctor told me I had anxiety and put me on paroxetine. Since then I have felt great and never looked back. The premature ejaculation went and I felt much better. I had always had negative panicky feelings but just thought it was normal and everyone felt like this but since starting it I have felt great.  It can be hard if you just stop the side affects are pretty bad but I am happy to keep on taking it because it works for me....hope this was helpful ;)""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have been prescribed Ambien for 3 years now, I used to take Xanax along with it so I never truly got to experience the hypnotic effects of Ambien on its own. Now I take it by itself and its a powerful medication. It can cause my appetite to get out of control, also  I had a major problem when I drank alcohol with it . My parents came home to find me, putting all my clothes in a suitcase I found somewhere in the house, a loaf of sliced bread spread all over the house and the yard, and me yelling at them for making my friends leave the game early, what the hell I was doing or talking about I still have no idea. So yes, don&#039;t drink and take Ambien in the course of a night because it leads to some bizarre activities. But all in all as a sleep aid it&#039;s great.""",0
Effexor,Depression,"""I discovered this site today while looking for other answers to the generic versions of Effexor XR.  I was on Prozac for about 4 years due to my MS and caring for and losing both my husband and mother to Cancer in a 18 month time frame.  I asked to switch to something else as Prozac didn&#039;t really help. It took a bit to wean me and put me on a low dose of Effexor ER 75mg a day and I eventually got bumped to 150mg a day of Effexor XR.  It&#039;s been a real life saver for me, I feel normal and do not have days of tears for no reason. """,5
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""hi, I got the nexplanon April 2016, it was great, I bled about 3 weeks straight, then some spotting, then nothing for almost a whole year when I bled for a week. my breast size increased by a whole cup size. Then the weight gain started, I was always a size one, and over the course of a year I jumped to size 5. Now I did go thru a really traumatic experience with abuse so it thought I could have been from that. Well I got my nexplanon removed a week ago and have already lost 5 pounds! my doctor told me when I got it that I probably wouldn&#039;t gain weight, well wrong.""",8
Pristiq,Depression,"""So I had anxiety and depression. My GP prescribed Lexapro initially, then Wellbutrin, then Zoloft (coupled with Xanax). Nothing was working and I was waking up in the morning every day with panic attacks. My GP recommended I go to a Psych, which I did for first time in my life. He changed me to long acting Xanex XR   Pristiq. Both have been massively better and Pristiq could be a game changer. The side effects I had adjusting to SSRIs were very very bad but getting on Pristiq has been very easy. Only a headache for 2 days. I recommend people try this. My panic attacks and anxiety literally vanished after 3-4 days. I feel like I finally found what I needed.""",5
Copper,Birth Control,"""I had the paraguard for 7 years. I was 20 with no children. I&#039;m also forgetful and wanted a birth control that I didn&#039;t have to worry about taking every day like the pill.I tried the depo shot but gained too much weight. I had absolutely no problems except for the fact that it was very painful when inserted, I&#039;m sure that it had something to do with me not being pregnant before. But..... I became pregnant last September. Either my iud moved because I became pregnant or because it had moved beforehand, I&#039;m not sure. Either way I couldn&#039;t feel the string and didn&#039;t schedule annual exams so I believe this caused me to become pregnant. I urge everyone with an iud to make sure you check yourself once a month and schedule exams every year!!""",8
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I was on Celexa which helped a lot for the first few months, then I started getting moody again. After about 2 years I went cold turkey. I was so depressed, it took a lot to just get out of my bed. I then tried Wellbtutrin, I liked it but I had a bad headache. I thought I could be okay off an antidepressant because I forgot what it was like not to be on one. So I dropped the Wellbutrin. I had nervous stomachs, crying, everything. My doctor gave me Pristiq and I have never felt so good in my life. I rate this a ten. It&#039;s the best.""",5
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve had anxiety my entire life, specifically with social interactions, and in the past year or two have experienced severe panic attacks. The anxiety and panic are linked to my depression, which altogether led to me being hospitalized. When I was there, they prescribed lexapro for my depression and hydroxyzine for my anxiety. The hydroxyzine meds took me out like a light, I could not stay awake to save my life. And when I was awake, I was completely out of it. After a few months of using it and getting used to it these side effects stopped, however it was hell waiting for them to stop. I would not recommend to anyone working, as I was at the time, but if you&#039;re willing to wait out the period of absent-mindedness, it can help calm you down.""",7
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I take Lexapro 20mg once daily and 5mg (for now) three times daily. The first week I didn&#039;t notice much at all.. But now that I&#039;ve been taking it for over a week I am starting to notice it&#039;s effects. Most notably when I let it dissolve under my tongue. This medication has no notable side effects. Only downside is its mildly underpowered. To me, Lexapro is the work horse, and Buspar is a helper.""",7
Tramadol,Pain,"""I was prescribed this medication for chronic severe neck pain.  I was taking 50mg per day.  While it worked to eliminate pain, I experienced constant nausea, vomiting, light headedness, and many symptoms of serotonin syndrome since I also take celexa each day.  Seroonin syndrome is serious and dangerous and can increase the likelihood of seizures.  Also, I&#039;m taking this medication at night and it keeps me awake all night instead of allowing a good night&#039;s rest.  """,9
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Best anti anxiety medication by far. It&#039;s Exactly like a Xanax + Valium combination. You get the potency, you get the long half life, you get the great muscle relaxing properties, you also get the best Maintnance Benzo, best for long term use . Etc etc. I tried Ativan, 7/10 rating. Valium, 8/10 rating, and Xanax, 6.5/10 rating. I finally got introduced to Klonopin, and I found exactly what I was looking for. 10/10!""",7
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""Taking 40mg as needed for social anxiety. Found it to be highly effective. Talking to strangers usually triggers a level of uncomfortableness to the point where I disengaged from the conversation after a short while. Helps alleviate those symptoms. Much more engaged in conversation overall, focusing on the subject matter of the conversation rather than eccentricities of myself, other person, etc.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been on it for about a month on and off and lost 20 pounds. I didn&#039;t excercise at first, but have made it to the gym everyday this past week. It makes you aware of what you eat and how much you eat. I put myself on a strict eating plan of all fruits, veggies, and lean meats. 

I have 3 friends who have taken it and it has changed their lives! It is a miracle pill! 

I noticed in the beginning I would wake up multiple times a night (but would always have maximum energy all day) so I took a Benadryl at night and it fixed it until I forgot to take it, and I realized I sleep all night without it now!

It has helped me, and for me I don&#039;t consider it a quick fix because I&#039;m more aware of what I consume. Just 40pds more to go for me!""",3
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have taken this medicine for 4 months now due to not being able to sleep with the depression medicines I&#039;m on. Ambien works wonders. I had a few odd moments where my child found me sleep walking, just in the fridge, hungry I guess. I saw things the first time I took a whole 10 mg. I&#039;m glad others wrote reviews because my husband thought I was mental. Other then that it&#039;s been a blessing. I wake up at 6:30 every morning refreshed and brand new. I would tell anyone if you take it laying down. Don&#039;t go walk around it&#039;s meant for bedtime for a reason. It&#039;s worth a try for anyone not being able to sleep. Oh also I sleep from 9 to 6 every night. I may wake up once and I take nothing else for sleep.""",0
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Taking 7.5mg, started one month ago. I was very nervous about taking my first dose,  but it&#039;s improved my quality of life dramatically. I sleep around 2hr after dosing, so I take it at about 8pm. I do experience some rather odd dreams! Which I find interesting rather than unpleasant, zero weight gain thus far. To anyone suffering from insomnia, don&#039;t be scared of this drug it feels like a very natural sleep/tiredness feeling at 7.5mg.""",0
Concerta,ADHD,"""it&#039;s a lot more mild than Ritalin and more effective than Focalin. The only problem i have with it would be weight loss (i&#039;m 5&#039;2&quot; and only 100 lbs) and sometimes i can&#039;t react as quickly as i would without the medication. weird, but an awesome drug for any adhd or add college student. It instantly gets rid of fidgeting and you&#039;ll be able to listen and focus to the most boring lecture imaginable (and learn from it!).""",1
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""Hi all. I am 31, 5&#039;9, 270 lbs. I&#039;ve been on Belviq for 8 days. On the 1st day I experienced a slight headache. I&#039;ve had no other side effects since then. After 4 days of Belviq, eating VERY healthy small portions &amp; doing 40 min of intense aerobics, I had not lost a pound! I was discouraged &amp; figured I wasn&#039;t a responder. My appetite wasn&#039;t suppressed either. Then I decided to take it on an empty stomach instead of with my meals. It works for me 100% now. Once I take it, I don&#039;t want anything to eat for about 3 hours. During that time, I just drink water. In the last 3 days I&#039;ve lost 6 lbs! I&#039;ll update again once my 30 day subscription is up. Feeling HOPEFUL again!""",2
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I&#039;m very pleased with Tenuate. It has changed my body completely. I have more energy and my body has stopped aching. I had back pain and knee pain almost every day. Since I started in February of this year I weighed 206 and am size 16. Now I am 164 and a size 10. I&#039;m very happy yet fearful if what its going to be like when I stop taking it or will this be a life long struggle. To keep the weight off.""",2
Tenuate,Obesity,"""I am no longer obese, but it looks like I will have to fight bulimia all my life. With ups and downs. It is not like I have not tried to work the roots of the problem, but extra help is needed now and then, as I can&#039;t eradicate it it seems. Tenuate has been a great support. I have used it sporadically, for moderate lengths of time. It has helped me so much when bulimia takes over, it lifts the dependency. Unfortunately it is no longer approved in Europe. I feel let down, and left to face my problems the hard way, again and again. """,2
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I lost 100 lbs in 8 months on my own by working out and eating healthier. I kept it off for 3 years and due to stressors and two night shift jobs I found myself gaining 47lbs in 6months. Very scary for me which brought on my depression and severe knee pain!! So my doc monitored my activity for 6 months and I lost 0 lbs and she decided to give this medication a try 4 days into it with a balanced diet and 4 days of an hour of exercise I have lost 7 lbs""",2
Trazodone,Anxiety,"""I have been taking trazodone for generalized anxiety disorder, some insomnia and mild depression for 40 days. This medicine helps me a lot for anxiety and insomnia but not too much for the mild depression. I think thanks to trazodone I got girlfriend because I felt relaxed more confident of myself and ideas come easily. I don&rsquo;t have important side effect just mild ones like getting some nights hard painful erections that makes me worry to get a priamism but finally it doesn&rsquo;t happen. Sometimes I feel a little sleepy and I experienced a little down in my libido but I am not sure this last one is caused by trazodone, anyway the benefits are over these mild side effects.""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""Today is 1 week of the two drugs in contrave, taken separately, and in different doses than contrave. (Cheaper w/ insurance to do it this way.) So far I am very pleased. Down some, the scale is flipfloping a bit--it actually broke-- but think I&#039;m down between 5-7 lbs. My energy has increased, and the SEs are minimal. I take a homeopathic called nux vomica the second my stomach feels funny, and I&#039;ve not really experienced and feelings of nausea because of it. Dreams are interesting and pleasant. Overall, I am extremely happy with my results so far. Three questions: Anybody else taking the drugs separately? Any girls out there still feel PMS cravings? Any reports from long term users?""",2
Tramadol,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve suffered from depression spells, and mood disorders, but have had CHRONIC anxiety/panic attacks my whole life. I&#039;ve taken a benzodiazepine for countless years, which worked well for some of these things but not all. Over the years I tried many different supplement meds typically prescribed for these issues, but none worked or they had horrible side effects on me. So my doctor suggested Tramadol--I asked how this could even work (a pain medicine)? He explained its an off-label use of the medication but has found it very successful in other similar psychiatric patients and how he researched and explained how it chemically works in the brain (which I didn&#039;t really understand)...but IT WORKS AMAZINGLY! I finally live a NORMAL and HAPPY life!""",7
Ultram,Pain,"""I underwent a two-level lumbo-sacral spine fusion (2-level PLIF) in 2007 and have been on Tramadol for chronic pain since then.  I find that Tramadol works as well as most opioids with less impairment at similar levels of pain relief.  I HAVE experienced two seizures thought to be caused by Tramadol while I was titrating upward on the drug, but have had no problems since.  I have tried titrating off of Tramadol twice and in both instances experienced moderate withdrawal symptoms of the opiate type almost immediately.  Overall I consider it a very effective analgesic for chronic low back pain with few side effects, but would recommend a prolonged titration off of the drug if you decide to discontinue use.  I give it a thumbs-up.""",9
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Last year I had my thyroid removed and in less than a year I went from 130 to 155. I was devastated with the rapid weight gain. 21 days ago I started on Belviq and I&#039;m proud to say, I&#039;m down to 142 lbs. I still have 17 lbs to go to be at my goal weight.  This year, I am celebrating a milestone birthday and I really don&#039;t want to feel overweight. Thanks to Belviq, I think I will meet my goal by 6 months. I no longer have food cravings, or hunger pains. I experienced slight headaches at first and dry mouth, and sleepiness, but it&#039;s gone now. I also get cold easily.  I eat 3 light meals a day and I exercise 3 to 4 times a week.""",3
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I felt compelled to compose this review as I have been through 33 years of HELL.

Like many of you I was labelled as just depressed or anxious - nothing worked, CBT went over my head, SSRIs were ineffective etc.

I went on second line SNRI treatment and all hell broke loose! Cycling within minutes literally wanting to tear my own limbs off from frustration then the next minute obsessing over meaningless rubbish.

I had had enough of the NHS and my job was on hold having been off a considerable amount of time.

I decided to get a private psychiatrist and it was the best money I ever spent.

I fit the bipolar 2 spectrum to a millimetre of its criteria - now I knew that I wasn&#039;t insane. Lamictal has saved me from suicide literally!""",6
Concerta,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 21 and I&#039;ve been taking 72mg (two 36mg barrels) a day since I was about 17. Concerta changed my life. I was failing school and no matter how hard I tried, it didn&#039;t change anything. I became depressed, slept for 14+ hours a day, I gave up. Then I was prescribed and it changed my life. It keeps me focused, motivated, and energized. Though, the side effects are very real. I don&#039;t sleep much, which is why I usually don&#039;t take it on weekends to catch up on sleep. It kills my appetite, so I eat a big breakfast before I take it in the mornings. It does elevate my anxiety, and not saying it&#039;s something I suggest.. but I smoke cigarettes to help that. Oh, and I don&#039;t know if this is common or not.. But it keeps my digestive track regular!""",1
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I started taking this medicine about 5 months ago for Neuropathy. The pain has gone away completely. I went from not being able to sleep at night and constant numbness in my toes and aching in my joints to no pain at all. BUT I am 20 and am not always able to go to bed before 10 pm so many days I cant take it because it will cause me to be completely unaware and sleepy for the entire next day. Even when I take it before 10 pm some days I just can&#039;t function the next day and that is becoming so inhibiting to where I don&#039;t take it. I literally fall asleep while driving.""",9
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started latuda after being on abilify since 2004. I was taken off abilify because I began vomiting every day and had severe rashes after being on the drug for about twelve years. Latuda is HORRIBLE! Mind you, I haven&#039;t actually had a serious psychiatrist sit down and actually understand my symptoms or who I am in about five years... seems as if that is non existent in my region or something now? I developed severe migraines on latuda, and have had more frequent seizures on this medication. The doctor I have seen ONE time this entire year doesn&#039;t want to work with me even though he even noticed I am extremely agitated and annoyed ALL the time on this medication. I used to be very calm and easy going; however, now everything irritates me.""",6
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I am 227 lbs and 5&#039;3&quot;. I started taking the Adipex 37.5 today (11-18-16) at 7:30 am. I could tell that I took it because I was very talkative, and not energetic as in bouncing off the walls or nothing, but more like I actually had the energy to do my work and I was really focused on it. Done more today at work than I done all week. Only thing I have a problem with is when I ate it felt like I slowed down, and all my energy was gone. Maybe it want be like this the whole time. I will keep ya&#039;ll updated on my progress.""",2
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I take this about three times a week to help me sleep. I have had insomnia for two years.  Even though I work 12-14 hours a day and jog 5 miles 4 times a week, I still could not sleep. Started taking this and it did not do much at first.  But now it really works! I can sleep about 7 hours and only wake once or twice and can go back to sleep pretty quickly usually. I wish I could take it every night but doing this lessens its effect on me.  I save it for 3 nights a week and struggle through the others.  Side effects are constipation, I never &#039;go&#039; the next day.  Also, pretty bad rebound insomnia, I do not sleep well the night after I have taken it.""",0
Citalopram,Depression,"""Just got prescribed 10 milligrams,  Thank God I decided to cut it in half just to see how I reacted to it, took it at night. Felt the effects in about a half hour, didn&#039;t sleep to well, felt wierd. Got in the morning to let the dog out and almost hit the floor, very dizzy.  I do feel more relaxed today, and somewhat better. I was told most people don&#039;t even know they are taking it , starts to work in about 4 weeks. Not me must be very sensative to it. I think I will try 5 milligrams again tonight and see how it goes. I will keep you all informed.""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am a 30 year old woman, recently diagnosed with ADD.  I always knew there was an issue there because I have always been extremely irritable/short-fused, indecisive, impatient, impulsive, forgetful, anxious, etc.  I somehow busted my butt through school and even managed to get my Bachelors degree but this came with re-reading lines of texts, taking several breaks while studying, and telling myself to focus constantly.  I usually stare at someone talking but don&#039;t know what was said because I was thinking of something else completely.  I couldn&#039;t remember movies or conversations to save my life.  Docs said it was anxiety and increased the dose constantly.  At 30mg and 4 days on Vyvanse, I feel great.  Only headaches here and there but I&#039;m hopeful!""",1
Accutane,Acne,"""The drug is honestly a hit or miss. It worked wonders for my brother who had severe acne; he has had only a few pimples since his first and only cycle ended over a year ago. However, I did not have such results. My face was clear for about 2 months following my first treatment and then it turned briskly into a battlefield again. I am now on my second cycle, at month 3, and acne is still everywhere. It&#039;s a cursed life, my friends.""",4
Duloxetine,Pain,"""I have fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, have had a hip replacement and extensive back surgery for spinal stenosis.  I had pain constantly at times almost to the point I could hardly walk.  After beginning Cymbalta the pain left.  I feel like I did 25 or 30 years ago.  I have had no negative side effects except an occasional mild headache and night sweats some nights.  This medication has been a life-saver, even stopping the nerve pains shooting down my legs.  It&#039;s worth trying it!""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been struggling with my weight for some time now and decided to speak with my Internist to see if she would give me a script for something that would curb my appetite for sweets &amp; fast food. She prescribed Contrave, honestly I&#039;ve never heard of this drug before. Did some research &amp; read everyone&#039;&#039;s comments and honestly, I was frightened by the many side effects. I&#039;m so desperate to lose the weight, I started my first dose today. I took the pill around 7:30 this morning and didn&#039;t begin to feel nauseated until around noon. Since most of the suggestions, said to drink water to help with the nausea. I found when I ate a few saltine crackers the nausea went away. Then came a slight headache. Other than that, I&#039;m fine. Good luck everyone""",2

On the pain scale level, I am generally at 7-8 w/o the medicine and 5 or 6 with the Opana. I guess I need to talk to my provider and see if there are some different options...""",9
Diclofenac,Pain,"""I had no clue what this stuff was. My grandma has been using it for her elbow. I was having a &quot;blonde&quot; moment I guess cause I was thinking how can a gel work when her pain is under the skin?

When I got up out of the chair I was amazed! Hardly any pain at all. I looked back at the gel and thought &quot;no way&quot; this has got to be in my head. So I got on the computer and decided to research this a little, I think when I go to my specialist I will ask for a prescription for this. However I think I may have used just a little too much, oh well!""",9

I have to make myself eat. The problem that I am having now is in the afternoon after my wkout classes I&#039;m hungry but I stick with low calorie options.  Can someone shed some light on staying full all day... Oh yea and the sleep pattern is out the window!""",3
Tramadol,Pain,"""I just started this med yesterday for osteoarthritis &amp; fibromyalgia. After reading the other comments my experience is pretty normal. I&#039;m itching like crazy, had a bad night-no rest, nausea &amp; mild headache. With all those side effects, it appears to have knocked off the edge of the pain. I will continue using if for a few days if I can handle the itching. I want to give it some time because I cannot use narcotics.

Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I have a son that has struggled with an attention problem in school since kindergarden. He is now 11 years old. We tried everything not to put him on medication. The homework struggle and impulsiveness became too much for us to handle, and we finally agreed to try something. His doctor told us about a new ADHD medication called Vyvanse. Believe this or not, it was like magic the first day. He was able to get all his work done in class, and went from a A,B,C student to all A&#039;s and one B in one quarter. We have the report cards to prove it. The side effects are minimal and for him the 30mg works great. I encourage anyone battling this problem to ask their childs doctor about Vyvanse. It has changed by sons life as well as ours.""",1
Citalopram,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was originally prescribed this for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. At 20mg it didn&#039;t help at all, but once raised to 40mg and combined with an anti-psychotic (to prevent manic episodes) it worked well for 5 - 6 months.

Unfortunately it stopped working completely, quite out of the blue, and neither myself, other half or medical professionals could figure out why. It was a shame as  I had virtually no side-effects on this medication, just some &#039;bruxing&#039; (teeth grinding) at night, but not to the point where my jaw ached or anything.""",6
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I began taking this medication Sunday morning. About 2 hours after I took the first pill. I began having painful stomach cramps that began near my diaphragm and moved all over my stomach. I also started in with diarrhea. Monday after taking it I still had the diarrhea but was also feeling very queasy. This morning I took the last pill I will ever take. I still had the diarrhea, but I  also had an unimaginably painful migraine, and started vomiting uncontrollably. It was so bad that I even aspirated it a couple times because I couldn&#039;t stop long enough to take a breath. I was in the ER from 10am-3pm on nausea and pain meds. I have never felt like I was going to die until today. Please be careful while on this medication.""",3
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m just about to hit the 2 year mark on the shot. I get my shot regularly and never skip an appointment. I rarely see people talk about being on the shot for more than a few months. I chose this to help regulate my period and for birth control. I had awful, heavy periods before this. When I first started my period lessened and after the first year completely stopped. The only &quot;con&quot; is that I have gained weight since I started taking this. I&#039;m wouldn&#039;t exactly blame this for it though, and so what if it&#039;s a few pounds. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants better control over their periods, and don&#039;t want to worry about pills or something being put inside them.""",8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Like most with acne as severe as mine normal topical remedies don&#039;t work. When none of the topical treatments worked my mom finally agreed to let me try oral medication. I have tried many (I don&#039;t remember the names) only one worked but it was too expensive for my mom at the time so I had to go off it. So again it got worse and all through my junior year I suffered. Finally my mom again decided she didn&#039;t want my scarring to get any worse so she agreed to put me on Accutane so we could get rid of it once and for all. I&#039;m on my first session and it has started to work. My only noticeable side effect is severe drying of my lips. Other than that I love the results. No more cystic acne, or white heads!""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hi today is nov 12 2013. I started taking phentermine 37.5 on nov 6 2013 my weight on the 6 th was 198lbs. Today i am 191.. I have not worked out on the pill because i have a cousin who lost 50lbs without working out.. I eat 3 small meals a day and 2 snacks. I Don&#039;t eat after 6 pm and i drink plently of water. No juice or soada.. My question is to all who has taking phentermine 37.5 along with a b12 pill once a week. Will this pill continue to work like this?? I am getting married in 6 months and i am so worried because i would love to get down to 150lbs by that time.. I plan to get of this pill in 3 months.. I have been loosing so quick and it has not been a week yet..My weight loss doctor prescribed them to me.""",3
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I started talking Alli February 18, 2016, I&#039;ve lost 9 lbs so far (3 weeks)! Week one I did not change my eating habits but I could tell the pills were working due to frequent visits to the rest room. Week two, I started eating healthier and noticed that I wasn&#039;t using the bathroom as much. I did not rate alli a 10 because I was constipated for 2 days, although it could be due to the fact thag i am no longer eating greasy goods like I was during week one. Overall I love Alli and it is really working for me. Losing those 9lbs motivated me to keep going!!""",2
Ambien CR,Insomnia,"""After having an accident at work a few years ago I wasn&#039;t falling asleep until the sun came up because of chronic pain.  My muscle relaxers and pain medicines were no longer giving me enough relief to sleep at night so my doctor put me on Ambien CR.  After about 2 weeks I had to stop taking it because I was hallucinating, I was suffering from severe anxiety, I had tremors, I don&#039;t have enough room here to list everything.  I am now on Restoril and I don&#039;t have any side effects at all.""",0
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Nexplanon inserted about 8 weeks after birth, the end of April. I&#039;m breastfeeding, so I had no period within those 8 weeks. The first week of insertion, I had no bleeding whatsoever. Had a minor headache shortly after insertion and had an ugly bruise for a while, but as far as side effects, that was it. The second week on it I started my period. I bled for about 7 days. After that, I was spotting lightly on and off for another week. Since then I have not had any bleeding. I was nervous about getting the implant based on bad reviews, but I&#039;m glad I did. Love it!""",8
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""I had high hopes for this medicines. I was suicidal and eventually broke down and told my psychologist. For the recovery process, I had my heart set on the combination of Effexor (venlafaxine) and Seroquel (quietapine) as I know these both work effectively in my system. Now wasn&#039;t the time to play about with a new medication but of course the psychiatrist knows best... am I right? Well, 7 days in and it&#039;s completely wiped out my cognition. I&#039;m normally a good driver and for several years I&#039;ve had no real issues, but within half an hour of driving today I nearly caused two accidents. I am so annoyed with the psychiatrist... they think they know everything but know so little about the medication they prescribe.""",5
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""Diagnosed with having anxiety, depression, and PTSD (raped year prior and recently lost my husband while 6m pregnant). I take 10mg 2x daily. The problems I have been facing have eased up significantly. At first I had no side effects so it was a win-win. Now after taking it for 3 months I have many side effects and I am going to stop taking it. The side effects I have been experiencing are headache, weak feeling, intense sugar cravings, hair loss, slow response, extreme anger, weight gain. I was losing weight after my pregnancy, exercising, felt very healthy. Now on buspar I have gained weight in odd places like my face. I find myself wanting to binge eat which I hardly even did while pregnant. Slowness and extreme anger were deal breakers.""",7
Accutane,Acne,"""I am an adult male who had tried almost everything THREE dermatologists.  Some antibiotics would work briefly, retin a pretty much burned my skin in a couple days and we had to stop, liquid nitrogen was sprayed on my face every few weeks.. you name it, they tried it.

Then,  my current derm (10 years now) put me on accutane when we first met. Three 20mg a day for 6 months. Yes, I had drying of my LIPS but no other major side effects and my acne stopped. Yes, we have had some flare ups and we use accutane briefly to stop them and they stay stopped for years. It is really the only medication that slams the door on my acne.. even if not forever.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have used phentermine in the past and lost a lot of weight but over the years I stopped taking it coupled with no exercise, bad bad bad eating habits, on top of a stressful life, and lack of sufficient amount of rest I gained all my weight back and high blood pressure. Today is 1/26/13. I will start the pills on Monday 1/28/13
I have 50lbs to lose. Here I go again but the pills will help me as they have in the past. """,3
Adderall,ADHD,"""Adderall is effective, but it comes with consequences. Both to your physical and mental health. I am 27 years old, I have taken Adderall on and off for about 10 years. Started it my freshman year of college. It was AMAZING at first! Lost that freshman 15, got straight A&#039;s, actually ENJOYED my work. Then I started noticing the crash symptoms. Tired, withdrawn, emotionless, sleepless. I stopped taking it because I hated the way it made me feel, but I realized how much more productive I am when taking it. When I start taking it again my immune system is shot, I&#039;m constantly sick with something, I get super irritable. When I don&#039;t take it I can barely get out of bed and I always gain weight, which always sucks. It&#039;s a vicious cycle.""",1
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m 16 and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II a month ago. I was put on Lamictal six days later. Around two weeks of the effective dosage, I started to see stability in both my depression and hypomania without any personality change or affective flattening. I did get canker sores however, but no signs of the SJS rash yet. This is overall a pretty effective medicine from my experience.""",6
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I took Elavil 100 mg for migraine and sleep back in 90&#039;s wow solved my problems. Quit taking, and now I&#039;m on 200 mg sleep and neuropathy from diabetes, sleep and stress. I take other medicines. I&#039;m not healed just no more pain. Sometimes fall asleep and times just breeze through the day. Elavil helps for many medical problems. Don&#039;t like the new medicines. The old medicines work best for me.""",9
Pristiq,Depression,"""I am on my third day of taking 50mg of Pristiq after 12 years of taking 150mg of EffexorXR every morning. I have had my depression and anxiety under control for the last 11 1/2 years because of therapy, family support and the EffexorXR. My main reason for trying Pristiq, which is very similar to Effexor, is to try to lessen the amount of time it takes to achieve orgasm. &quot;It takes forever!&quot; My doctor seems to think this will help. We&#039;ll see.""",5
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I am a leukemia patient and after all the meds I&#039;ve been on and still are on sleep can be a challenge to say the least. I was originally put on 15 mg of Remeron at 
bedtime to help gain weight for Bone marrow transplantation  (BMT) but found it helpful for sleep as well. After taking it for 2 years it started not to work as well, so now I take 1mg Ativan and 15 mg Remeron for sleep. It takes about 2-3 hours to kick in but I sleep an average of 8-9 hours a night. Cup of coffee after breakfast and I&#039;m not groggy. Hope this somehow helps.""",0
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had the Nexplanon in for about 2 1/2 years and I could go months without my period which I loved but when I get it it will last for weeks and I will have bad cramps and PMS. Also even when I&#039;m not on my period I will be moody and emotional. My sex drive is completely gone, which is a huge problem because I&#039;m 19 and in a relationship so it sucks and almost makes me want to get it out early.. But it&#039;s just so convenient to have, you don&#039;t have to worry about taking anything or using anything to have sex. I would recommend it because it affects everyone differently but I may not get a new one in just because of some of the side affects for me.""",8
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I had great hopes for this relatively new sleep med. 10 mgs is useless and when you finally do fall asleep the dreams are borderline hallucinogenic. Incredibly real life non stop dreaming that makes you awaken cause they are so strange!! I adjusted to 20 mgs as prev read and then I slept better and the dreams weren&#039;t as crazy but still present. In my opinion, ambien 12.5 cr is still king. I will be going back to it when this rx runs its course. My main disappoint with this new med is frequent awakenings, longer time to fall asleep, and crazy dreams!""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I just started taking phentermine yesterday 2/8/2011.  When I weighed myself yesterday morning the scale said 273.0 I took the pill and my appetite was completely gone. I ate a very small breakfast and had to force myself to eat anything for lunch.  When dinner came I wasn&#039;t hungry but I figured I should eat something.  I drank 9 bottles of water because my mouth was so dry.  I didn&#039;t have any issues sleeping and I didn&#039;t notice any change in my energy level. When I woke up this morning I headed straight to the scale and I&#039;d already lost 3lbs. The scale said 270.8.  I&#039;m very excited and super motivated to continue.""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""This is another update... I started taking the medicine on 6/23. I was 301 pounds. Today, 7/3, I am 287! 14 pounds in 10 days- not too shabby :) I noticed that I haven&#039;t lost any weight in the past 2 days, so I&#039;m going to play with my diet some. Also, I&#039;ve noticed that if I take the medicine before 11am, I&#039;m STARVING by bedtime. I now take it between 11-11:30 and it keeps me feeling full throughout the day. I only eat one small meal after this. I will update again next week with my progress!""",2
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I was depressed by my acne but was hesitant to try Accutane because I feared the side effects. After months of researching reviews and testimonies I finally decided to try it. I never write reviews but I want to share my story because accutane worked for me. It changed my life and self-esteem. I experienced very little side effects while taking it. My acne did get worse before it got better, but I&#039;ve been off accutane for almost two years and my skin has stayed clear. I had hoped to come across a review like this while I was researching the drug, and I hope this is reassuring to people who need it.""",4
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have tried other medicines for Bipolar Disorder and some worked and some did nothing. Lithium made me feel strangely dull and sleepy the first two weeks but I wanted to give it a good chance. Around the 15th day, I woke up and felt fine, two months later I still feel fine. I am also taking 15mg of Buspirone and 20mg of Celexa. I never thought I would be able to really live until now. My moods are not extreme anymore and I don&#039;t have suicidal thoughts. It is like a switch was slipped. 
My doctor started me at a very low dosage of Lithium, I am so glad she did - I only need 300mg once a day.""",6
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I was having panic attacks so bad I would have to pull off the road while driving. My husband was waiting on a double lung transplant when these attacks started. After the transplant the care giving made these attacks become worse. I couldn&#039;t breathe, I wanted to cover up under something and not come out. My doctor gave me Lexapro and one dose made me worse. He ask me to try Cymbalta and after one dose I became immediately better. I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for 4 years, and would hate to go back to the times when I had those attacks. It obviously was the medicine I needed.""",7
Methadone,Pain,"""Methadone is my lifesaver. I have had back pain associated with nerve damage. Degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, bursitis and some other minor/major problems here and there. I was taking ten to twelve Percocets a day. I heard about clinics that give doses of methadone daily. I went and now I&#039;m happy to get my methadone daily. I take nothing else and couldn&#039;t be happier. Methadone works the best for pain and its long-acting and I take it for opiate addiction as well. I&#039;m on 50 mg and it just works great.""",9
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I was given trazodone for my mind racing. I was on Lunesta before, but I have to take two pills to fall asleep (6mg) and I guess 3mg is the daily limit. The doc gave me 50mg of trazodone it did nothing but make my vision blurry. I even took one Lunesta with the 50mg trazdone and was up all night long. So tonight I&#039;m trying 100mg trazodone, noticed already my vision is blurry, HOPING this will allow me to sleep tonight.""",0
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I took 25mg of Trazodone one night and will never take it again!
I hour after going to sleep I woke up to find the room spinning.  My heart was pounding and racing.
I was sweating profusely and extremely frightened.  It has been two days and I am still having a few dizzy spells.  
Be very careful if you take this medication and make sure you have someone around that can help you have a bad reaction.
Hope this helps.""",0
Zoloft,Bipolar Disorde,"""I use Zoloft for my depressive episodes due to bipolar disorder. I have unsuccessfully tried about fifteen other anti depressants in the past. Zoloft works wonderfully! With Zoloft, it doesn&#039;t take long for my depressive symptoms to fade. The only side effect that I experience is the complete loss of my sex drive. It is very common with SSRIs. Fortunately, I talked to my doctor about it and he prescribed Periactin to take with it. Periactin is very effective at addressing the issue.""",6
Celexa,Depression,"""My son 16 was started on Celexa for depression and anxiety. He has had absolutely no side effects. One month after starting 20 mg his mood was significantly improved. More outgoing, cooperative, less argumentative, decreased anxiety. It is truly amazing. I am a nurse and have to say it was very noticeable. Now that school has started the anxiety and stress have increased so I am seeing a little more mood swings. Of course this is nothing compared to before. He goes to his psychologist regularly and sees his family doctor on a regular basis. Patients must remember that nothing works overnight and therapy is great along with the medication.""",5
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""It was really good medicine for people with anxiety and panics disorders. I been taking sertraline (Zoloft) 100 mg and Buspar 20 mg total morning and evening and it was really helping me out with general anxiety and reduce panics from my daily life. I had this thing when I go in to any store myself I feel like everyone is watching me like I am going to steal something. That triggers my anxiety and my stomach aches and breathing pattern switch to worst situation ever. Facial all red and it was really painful life. Buspar took care 70 percent of that problem for others was 9 out of 10. I say Yes to Buspar. I suggest talk with your psychiatrist about acute anxiety and consult about having Buspar.""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""This pill is the best I ever had! I can&#039;t believe the difference. I&#039;m so happy!! No painful acne whatsoever. My blemishes are also fading away. I never thought in a million years my skin would look this good. I struggled with acne since I was 12. It got worse when I Got older. I&#039;ve been on doxycycline hyclate for about 5 months. My skin looks great. I&#039;m just worried that once I&#039;m off these pills my acne will all come back again. I just hope it doesn&#039;t.""",4
Belviq,Obesity,"""I lost over 100 lbs with Redux in 3 months back in &#039;96. When they removed it from the market I slowly gained all back plus some. I am so happy a safer version of this medicine has finally been released. On day 2 and I feel 85% the same as I did back then. I am now eating to live instead of living to eat. Cravings are gone. Today when I got home I was utterly exhausted because I had only consumed 400 calories. I had this with Redux, but a 27 year old body can tolerate a lot more abuse than a 43 year old one. So far I am very pleased - just have to plan better. Worst thing is the cost.""",2
Accutane,Acne,"""Accutane is a miracle worker! Although its such a hassle to get the medication, what with the restrictions and blood tests and questions, it is completely worth it. I did experience some of the common side effects, those being extremely dry everything, and the occasional headache... and depression. But beyond that it is worth it to no end. I also would suggest not drinking while on Accutane. If you plan on drinking, drink in moderation. The first time I drank on Accutane the next day my face broke out and I got a rash on my arms. """,4
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have noticed since I have been on this medication I have become more happy and able to deal with my depression that I was suffering for a few days. I have noticed differences in my sleep pattern. I go back to bed earlier and I wake up early which can be a problem for me at times because I need lots of energy during the day to keep me going because I will get tired and depressed. My mood starts to slip after 3:00 which can be annoying.""",6
Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorde,"""It made my &quot;down side&quot; not go as deep, but I felt like I could not leave the house - I didn&#039;t want to.  No visitors - didn&#039;t want any. Since I&#039;m a very social person my friends and family were concerned. My &quot;up side was better - I wasn&#039;t POed all the time and the thought racing slowed way down. Not the best experience, but better than the whole trip down the rabbit hole it would have been.""",6
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""After permanent SCI (Spinal Cord Injury), I&#039;ve had a lot of experience with pain. Hydromorphone 4 mg was prescribed for break-through pain and has worked pretty well. I agree, better learn to live with a level of 4 (out of 10). I don&#039;t worry about addiction, I&#039;ve got this the rest of my life, but every doctor I&#039;ve talked to warns of building a tolerance; better learn to live with a little more pain now rather than more pain later.""",9
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I recently switched my birth control from estrogen to the Mini pill which contains no estrogen but hormone progestin or &quot;POPs&quot;. My doc said it was because of my age and smoking. I&#039;ll be 35 on may by the way. Within 2 weekes of taking these POPs I started experiencing complete numbness in my arms,hand and lower down there it was horrible. I couldn&#039;t sleep for about four days and not sure about my insurance I didn&#039;t go to Any urgent care or anyplace. So I stopped the pill and I feel fine. I&#039;m just wondering if there is anyone else out there that had any kind of experience like mine if so I would love to hear about it
Thank you

Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This was wonderful for taking my mind off of food, helped reduce the stress of always focusing on what I was eating, calorie intake, and still not losing weight.  I found myself having to force myself to eat something, which was a huge contrast from eating because I was bored or stressed.  I found I was stressing over food all the time and by the end of the day I didn&#039;t want to think about it anymore more so I would just say the heck with it and eat without caring.  Now with Phentermine I have the will power with ease and don&#039;t even care if I eat and if I do it is a much smaller portion.  It is absolutely vital for success that you at least walk 20 minutes five times a week and reduce fried foods and eat more fruit and veggies.""",3
Ativan,Insomnia,"""I was given Ativan for occasional use. I try to use it once every week or once every ten days for sleep. (0.5mg). I&#039;m lucky that I don&#039;t have to use it any more regularly because I don&#039;t work right now. I find that it helps me relax to sleep, and I wake up feeling and looking rested. The looking rested part is important because it tells me how good it is at actually calming the anxiety. I know that when my anxiety is high, even if I sleep 10hrs, I&#039;ll wake up tired and looking tired. But I think this medicine actually does a good job of getting rid of that anxiety, so your body can rest and get into some level of &quot;deep&quot; sleep.

But absolutely, really only use it on the day that you must.""",0
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had Implanon inserted since November 2010 after the birth of my son. No period until yesterday, which surprised me (after 19 months without periods). I have had no weight gain (despite a very good appetite and a love for cooking), but no libido at all (because of the breastfeeding as well). I stopped breastfeeding 2 months ago when my son was 18 month old, maybe my hormones production changed, and the birth control in the same time. I do acrobatic dance too and I wonder if the implant is still in place: for some of my tricks my partner needs to grab my arm over the implant.  I will check with the doctor on Monday. I may ask her to remove it and take regular pills instead.""",8
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I started taking Vyvanse in the latter half of 6th grade due to disruptions and conflicts at school.  I took it almost everyday during the school year, until 11th grade.  I stopped during the summers.

I moved from 40mg, to 35, to 30, to 60, then to 50mg.
As i took the pill daily, i lost appetite constantly.  Though there was no concern of my weight, i did stay quite thin while i was on it. (i was not unhealthy.)  
However, after i ceased to intake vyvanse, i had a large burst of weight gain.
I went from 140 to 210 in about 4.5 months.  I bordered near &quot;above average&quot; on the body fat chart.  This gain in weight was, i believe, the direct result of stopping the pill.""",1
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I came to this site to see if I was only person who had some minor issues with this medication. I started Opana ER 10mg 4 days ago. I was to start it 9 days ago but my insurance initially wasn&#039;t going to cover the cost. My doctor filled out some forms and I am preapproved for a year. I find that the medicine is great for my pain but it does not last 12 hours, I have found that at 8 to 9 hours later I need another one. If prescribed 3&#039;s daily it would be a perfect medication and who knows maybe I wouldn&#039;t need my breakthrough medicine.""",9
Seroquel,Insomnia,"""I started taking Seroquel about 10 years ago. I have to take about 600mg a night plus Ambien to get a good nights sleep (this is as prescribed by my doctor). I don&#039;t know what I would do without it. It changed my life when I realized what a good nights sleep could do. My depression improved just by sleeping better. I&#039;ve never had any terrible side effects. I do tend to have to eat after I take it as it seems to make it work faster. I did have a small amount of weight gain (5-10lbs) but nothing like when I tried Zyprexa (30-40lbs)! Seroquel is definitely something you should ask your doctor about!""",0
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""Have suffered with insomnia for years. Tried many medications with Zolpidem  ER (Generic Ambien ER) 12.5 the only one that helped. Even then, still was not getting great results at times.  Tried 10 mg of Belsomra, hoping for a better result. This was one of the worst nights I have ever had in my life.  Was wide awake until 4:30, followed by horrible, segmented, almost hallucinogenic dreams. After my alarm woke me, I was in the strangest state of mind, where I had to make myself speak. I finally told my husband, I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;ve got plenty of conversation in my head, but I have to MAKE myself speak.  I was afraid to drive after this, and had my son drive me. This condition eventually got better. One dose. Never again.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Started phen mid May 2015 I lost 51 pounds as of October 29 2015 185 only 50lbs. and I will be at my goal . I would recommend this for anyone having trouble lossing weight on their own. Yes you will get dry mouth I always bring a bottle of water with me and it helps . I have lost my taste for most carbs and my appetite has shrunk. I look forward to doctors appointments the more I loss the lower my blood pressure goes my other goal is to get off blood pressure meds. Go back to doctors 12/2015 I&#039;m hoping for big numbers.

Isotretinoin,Acne,"""After hearing about the horror stories, I was hesitant to try Accutane. I tried Minocycline (Solodyn), Doryx (Doxycycline), and Bactrim DS. The only thing that was pretty good at clearing was Bactrim DS. Bactrim worked best, but was not working anymore. I had no choice but to go with Accutane. It was a little drying with the eyes initially and my lips still get dry. What people fail to mention is that your body adjusts to the side effects and that you won&#039;t have an initial breakout if you start low. I started at 40mg. Going to 60mg this month (my second month). Don&#039;t forget, Accutane takes between 2-4 months to see clearing. Good luck! :)""",4
Bupropion,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Wellbutrin for a year and a half now. I had been reluctant to admit I was depressed even though I was miserable. I was rude and snappish with everyone, unhappy with myself and just wanted to die. Then I started Wellbutrin.  Immediately, those thoughts in my head about what an awful person I was stopped.  When I consciously tried to think about them again, I couldn&#039;t do it without my brain also coming up with all the reasons those negative thoughts were ridiculous and untrue. The only side effect I noticed was lack of appetite but that went away after about three weeks.  This medicine works really well for me.  I feel so much more like myself.""",5
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""Started taking it this evening and the injection didn&#039;t hurt at all, didn&#039;t even feel it.  I did feel a little  itchy and burning sensation after though.  I did have a little panic attack after I think I had just worked myself up for all of the worse side effects.  It&#039;s been a few hours and haven&#039;t felt any nausea or any other side effects. Hopefully it will stay that way.  Excited to start this journey.""",3
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I will start off by stating I am a pharmacist so I have some additional knowledge to back my statements but also am on Geodon 100 mg total daily dose. First off, you must take with a meal (at least 400 calories) or else you&#039;re only getting about 40% of your dose. Secondly, it can cause drowsiness (or somnolence), however, I did not experience that myself. Also, you must be on a pretty solid dose to treat bipolar 1 so slowly increasing MAY be necessary to prevent side effects, and if that&#039;s the case you must be patient. It did take me a few days to get up to a dose I could tolerate and that did mean some extra days of hypomania, but it was worth it for the relief I feel now.""",6
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""I have been constantly on pain medication for 6 years due to a wreaked back. I was on Hydrocodone 7.5 4x a day; and it work fine, but when you take the same meds no matter what it is over 6 years it doesn&#039;t work as well after a while. So I talked with my Doctor and He Dr. decided I needed to try  Hysingla 20mg, and assured me it would work great. Well after two weeks of sleepless nights and loss of work I had Had it!! This was the biggest waste of my money and time. Not only is this crap cost twice as much with my insurance, but it DOES NOT WORK!

Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am 41 years old and have been taking phentermine as of September 2, 2008 to December 20, 2008. I have lost 35 pounds. It has been a huge blessing in my life.

It has been a great experience but be sure to see a doctor before taking this medication. The side effects I experienced were dry mouth (I chewed sugar-free gum all of the time and drank lots of water) and constipation. It seems to get better after being on the pill for awhile.

Stared at the ceiling with a headache until 3:00am. Took another 10mg tab and finally fell asleep about 3:30. Had an extremely vivid nightmare. (I have always dreamed in Technicolor and stereophonic sound, but this was over the top.) Woke up at 5:00am then fell back asleep and had a normal dream, but then was only in a very light sleep when the alarm went off at 7:00am. Will try again tonight with 20mg. The jury is out.""",0
Effexor XR,Depression,"""Been on this for over 10 years. I take 2 different doses every morning - 75 mg and 37.5 mg (which was added about 3 yrs ago). While no drug is perfect, it has saved my life - both figuratively and literally. I&#039;ve had great success with this medicine. Be forewarned though about missing a day: loopy feeling, lightheaded or a weird feeling in your head (not pain), like a short buzzer effect. Over the years, if I missed a day, I actually did not feel comfortable driving. If you miss 2 days you&#039;ll experience heart palpitations and will definitely feel bad. These are the reasons why this medicine should never be suddenly stopped. The dose should gradually be lowered. Conversely, the medicine should be started on a low dose, working up as needed.""",5
Differin,Acne,"""This summer I&#039;ve broken out severely. I&#039;ve tried Proactiv, AcneFree, and Clean and clear Advantage. Proactiv didn&#039;t work at all and AcneFree was very harsh on my skin! Clean and Clear did help but not that much. I finally went to the doctor and she prescribed Differin. I&#039;ve been taking it for a couple of weeks now and I am starting to see a difference. I&#039;ve even noticed that my acne scars are healing and getting lighter. I haven&#039;t got any of those huge- hurt your face pimples either.""",4
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I took Effexor for the first and last time yesterday around 7:41 am . At first I couldn&#039;t feel my arms or face and then it felt like fire works were going off in my head . I yawned all day long and each time I did I felt like my own tongue was gagging me . The worst of it was around 3:45 am I woke up shaking uncontrollably falling over couldn&#039;t see straight it felt like I was being electrocuted it was to the point I either wanted to be knocked out or die . My husband found me shaking and rocking back and forth in our living room floor . This drug for me personally was horrific .""",5
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have been taking 50 mg of Trazadone for over a year now.  I think it&#039;s awesome!  I was prescribed it for insomnia, I have had insomnia since high school and I&#039;m talking BAD insomnia, like 3 hours or less a night.  I could not cope any more.  I also have depression and anxiety, so I take 37.5 mg of Paxil everyday.  I take the Paxil in the am and the Trazadone at night.  When I take my normal dose of T. I wake up fine, not hungover, sick or anything.  The ONLY time I feel yuck when waking up is if I have tried to cut the T. down, which I have tried.  I don&#039;t like the withdrawals at all, I would rather take these pills for life then suffer the withdrawals.  I believe the T has also helped me with my depression.""",0
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am 16 and I started using Vyvanse a little over one month ago. I am a very bright student but I found myself struggling through school. I was diagnosed with ADD around 4th grade. I have always had trouble focusing and staying on task. I tried Concerta, Ritalin, Strattera and Adderal. After taking those I took about a 4 year break from medicine. I began Welbutrin and am now taking that in combination with Vyvanse. My grades improved tremendously. I can now focus and it shows. I went from a D in Algebra/Geo to an A. My life and confidence has improved more than I ever thought possible. I do have decreased appetite but other than that, this medicine is literally making my future brighter everyday.""",1
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""Since starting Adderall XR about 6 months ago, I am more focused and headstrong than ever. I can actually DO the things I used to enjoy, such as birdwatching (which requires extreme focus) and practicing music (again, extreme focus). Once my attention locks in, I&#039;m good to go; which is a first! Furthermore, it seems to help with my emotions; I feel more balanced and self confident on it, I don&#039;t feel like such a &quot;headcase&quot; and so emotionally fragile. Kind of sort of a miracle drug. Did it make me suddenly do things I have been putting off, such as cleaning and sorting out paperwork? No. But can I clean and do paperwork with more patience and ease? Yeah. The only side effects I experienced that were negative was extreme appetite suppressment""",1
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I have suffered almost all my life (childhood to 52 years old) with anxiety, mood swings, rage, muscle aches, irritable bowel, teeth clenching, heart palpitations, etc, etc, etc.  I have been called a hypochondriac.  This is the first time I have taken this medicine and it has helped minimize or completely elevate my symptoms.   I just wish I was given this earlier in my life. It would have saved me from a whole lot of suffering.""",7
Copper,Birth Control,"""So I just got my IUD inserted a few hours ago. I&#039;m 17 with no children. So about a week after consultation, the day arrived. I took naproxen about 8 hrs ahead of time and even took some before I went in so the cramps wouldn&#039;t hit me immediately afterwards. So the procedure itself wasn&#039;t terrible. I&#039;ve had period cramps worse than that. The worst part were the clamps that opened my cervix, but I was fine. I was just finishing my period so I recommend getting this procedure done when you&#039;re either on your period or just after it. Honestly, it wasn&#039;t terrible. I&#039;ve taken more naproxen and am chilling with a heating pad. There is a bit of spotting but nothing to bad. I&#039;ll update when I get my period.""",8
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""I started with my Saxenda 0.6 injection for the first two (2) weeks and had no side affects at all. Prior to deciding to taking Saxenda, I had did quite amount of research to find out about Physicians in the St, Louis area. the success and side effects. The blogs all talked about the nausea and constipation that was horrible. This was a big delay for me making a decision to try the drug. My obesity is a health factor and can potentially become life  threatening so I weighed the pros and cons and decided that i would try anyway to see if I could weather the side affects. After the first two (2) weeks of injections and NO SIDE AFFECTS, I return to the doctor for a follow-up appointment to find that I had lost 14.5 pounds.  Try it for yourself""",3
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""About a week ago I experienced a somewhat traumatic event that kept me awake at night. I felt as soon as the sun went down my anxiety started to gradually rise until I had pain in my chest and was hypventilating. Nothing could calm me down or get me to sleep. I finally went to see my doctor and he gave me 10 days of Ativan. Last night was the first time I took one, or any benzo for that matter, and it was like a miracle worker. Within 10 minutes of taking one 0.5g sublingual tab it&#039;s like all the anxiety in me went out the window. I felt I still needed to control my thoughts to steer away from provoking an attack but it sincerely helped calm me down to a point where I felt safe and was able to sleep. Definitely recommend.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I began talking Adipex since March 10, 2009.  I am down 14 pounds.  I found that after a couple of weeks I was getting a tolerance to the medication. I stopped taking it for two days and the weight started to fall off again.  I exercise at least 3 times a week by walking and running on my treadmill and using stretch bands.  I feel great. I still have twenty pounds to go, but I am eating MUCH healthier and do not crave junk food anymore.  Make sure you change your eating habits so you don&#039;t gain the weight back when you get off the medicine.  This is just the jump start that I needed to get back in shape after having two kids.""",3
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Gosh, reading these reviews is making me feel like a sane insane person. I&#039;m inching on my 3 year mark and I&#039;m so ready to get this taken out. I&#039;ve never experience moodiness/PMS my whole life; I&#039;ve always been very even tempered and relaxed. Since getting it inserted I&#039;ve experience anxieties and mood swings like never before. Full blown anxiety attacks and sleepless nights. ZERO libido. Moods that are different every single day. It&#039;s SO frustrating not knowing what type of person I&#039;ll be when I wake up. Weight gain!  2 weeks until I get this thing out, can&#039;t wait! A little nervous that nothing will change and that I&#039;m actually just crazy! Ha! But definitely a complete change from before. Will never get on birth control again""",8
Copper,Birth Control,"""I had the Paraguard put in by my Midwife, who recommended I take 3 Motrin beforehand. It was excruciating and didn&#039;t let up. It felt like a knife was inside my cervix, and the pain made me nauseous, dizzy, shaky, and see stars. I felt like I was going to pass out that night. The next day when I called, they ordered an emergency ultrasound. My body was trying to push the IUD out and it &quot;migrated&quot; so that instead of the top of the T laying horizontal and flat, one side was poking into me. They removed it immediately and the removal was also painful, but I had relief from the stabbing pain right away. She looked at the device and it had even bent (in 24 hours). I would not recommend this device.""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m taking escitalopram known as &quot;Cipralex&quot; in the country I&#039;m in temporarily, better known as &quot;Lexapro&quot; in the States, and I&#039;ve found it surprisingly effective for my anxiety. I feel calm, relaxed, and content at almost all times. Also, I find myself comfortable in situations where my anxiety used to get the best of me. Lexapro is a true pharmaceutical innovation. I fully recommend this drug for anxiety/depression/apathy.""",7
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Been taking 0.6mg since Friday 27th January. The first dose was taken at 7pm as I had read that it does make you feel tired. So far, I have felt mildly nauseous and tired, but I tend to sleep it off so I am ok for the remainder of the day. 

Now on my third dose and I decided to drink low calorie ginger ale to curb the nausea. It seems to be doing the trick. I do have a loss of appetite so I need to remind myself to eat so that I keep my nutrition up. I must admit that I did feel thirsty for the first couple of days and wake up in the middle of the night feeling a bit spaced out with a slightly elevated pulse, but this goes away by mid morning following a small snack.

Will wait and see if this results in meaningful weight loss""",2
Implanon,Birth Control,"""So I got the implanon inserted 2 years ago in the last 2 years I have gained about 20 kgs , lost my sex drive , my emotions have been up and down like a yoyo just cry then want to punch something then have no idea what I was even sad/angry about . I would get my period for 2 weeks then another 3 weeks of spotting then it finishes then 1 week later I start pmsing again . But I didn&#039;t get pregnant ! I have just had it taken out 1 year early as I can&#039;t deal with the side effects anymore . I guess there are different contraceptions that work for different people but I must say this one didn&#039;t go well for me .""",8
Doryx,Acne,"""Three days ago, I went to the dermatologist for the first time. I have a modest severe problem with acne and have been using all kinds of over the counter acne products like Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clean and Clear, etc. She said that I have been wasting a lot a lot of money on the acne products I have used in the past, just because they are all the same . She put me on Doryx 150 MG, Differin 0.3%, and also told me to wash my face with Cetaphil. I can say that my acne scars, which I have on both cheeks, have faded a little and the size of my pimples have gotten smaller. She said that the first month is going to be the worst because I will breakout but should see a big improvement the second month. I am really depending on this to work! """,4
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I remember reading all these reviews before I took it because I was so scared of the side effects that I might get so I thought I would review it. I know everyone reacts differently but so far this medication has been great. It has slowed down those over thinking anxious feeling&#039;s a lot! The side effects were minor. Mild digestive problems, occasional yawning episodes (a bit annoying). The one that is probably the biggest issue is the complete loss of appetite, I just feel like drinking a lot of water. I don&#039;t feel hungry and have lost 2kg in the 3 weeks I have been on it.   I am hoping in time these side effects will eventually go away. They are pretty mild and something I can put up with since it is helping me with my anxiety.""",7
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia as well as degenerative disc disease/arthritis in my cervical spine. I was given several different meds, eventually ending up with 50mg of tramadol. I recently had spinal fusion in my neck and have been in OxyContin/oxycodone and have had good post op pain relief, but little to no effect on my fibro symptoms. I&#039;ve been asking my doctor for tramadol for several weeks (I&#039;m 9 weeks post op) and he has said I wasn&#039;t ready for that weak a medication yet. Finally today he agreed to take me off of oxycodone and let me get back to tramadol for my main pain, which is fibromyalgia. It does not make me sleepy like oxycodone and it controls the pain in my legs/hips that just doesn&#039;t get relieved from oxy.""",9
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""Diagnosed with bipolar disorder 7 months ago, this medicine is the first that has actually WORKED. Tried Lamictal, Depakote, Trileptal, etc. I was prescribed Geodon 2 months ago it stabilized my mood, staves off depression and gives me hope for a normal life.

However, I&#039;m unusually forgetful (unusual for me) and confused (er, more than usual for me). I don&#039;t remember dreams or anything that happens for 6 hours after I take it at bedtime. Also noticing that I bruise very easily and I&#039;m sweating ALL of the time, strong smelling urine. """,6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""As most pointed out here, pretty much useless.  Had hoped for a new thing since I&#039;ve had insomnia (actually, shifted phase sleep rhythm), for most my life.  So for now, though it&#039;s losings it&#039;s effect due to being on it for years, I&#039;d highly recommend Lunesta.  (It&#039;s not perfect, but it does work, especially for double insomnia.) Also, a generic is now finally available (cheap and, just as important, it is the ONLY sleep med currently approved by the FDA for LONG TERM use!  Ambien is NOT.""",0
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 21 and I got the nexaplon Around December of 2015. Insertion was okay he numbed it so I didn&#039;t feel a thing. Everything was fine, my period started the beginning of January for like a week. First few weeks sex was painful &amp; EVERY time me and my boyfriend would have sex, I would bleed for about 2-3 days following.  And ever since January 18,2016 I HAVE BEEN BLEEDING SINCE. 3 months without sex and I&#039;m going crazy lol. I know it takes awhile for your body to adjust to hormones and whatever but this is extreme and I&#039;m actually getting it removed to get the mirena IUD. Hopefully I have a better experience with it. I was on the pill for about 5 years but the estrogen give me migraines.""",8
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I began treatment on Qsymia under my physician&#039;s care in March 2014 at 249 lbs. and followed simple steps towards changing my eating habits and amping up my exercise regimine. It was not an overnight result. I had ups and downs; definitely more positive than negative. Today I weigh 138 lbs. I am a 56 yr old grandmother and feel better and more youthful than I did 15 or more years ago! My eating is a lifestyle, not a diet. My exercise is my therapy that makes me happy. The two combined gives me a healthy body and Qsymia jump-started it all. Going into it with the right frame of mind and determination will make all the difference. Qsymia is the tool that worked for me and I love what it did for me!""",3
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""After 7 years on various SSRI&#039;s and many other tried and tested medicines I finally stumbled across propranolol. A truly life changing medicine for my anxiety disorder. I always presented with high blood pressure and my belief is that hypertension is an underlying cause of crippling anxiety. If it isn&#039;t then it is most certainly involved in the anxiety circle, more hypertension, more anxiety, more hypertension, etc. Anyway this is the best medication I have ever taken...my mind and body seem to be healing in a way I can only describe as miraculous!
Please bear with this medication, although it does work immediately I&#039;d say it takes around 6 weeks to fully bed in.""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""First week I felt fatigue and almost stopped taking it. But I wasn&#039;t sure if it was the medicine or something else going on? Also almost immediately I had no desire to drink alcohol, I was in the habit of drinking wine almost daily. So this was amazing to me. (reading more, it&#039;s also used for stop smoking and drinking, well that certainly happened for me) I&#039;ve been taking it for about 2 months and I&#039;ve lost 15 pounds and I&#039;m also following a low carb diet too. I also found that my mood improved too...I feel less moody and just calmer and happier....which is making my boyfriend very happy. LOL, I&#039;m in my early 50&#039;s so I think I was going through the change and it was affecting my moods. Overall....it&#039;s been working great for me.""",2
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I have had anxiety all my life and I am now 63 years old. About 3 years ago my life spun out of control with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder and I was not functional as a human being. I tried Buspar to start and it did nothing to help me then I tried Zoloft and I could not handle the side effects. Finally I got on brand name Lexapro which started helping me. Once I leveled off at 40 mg per day I resumed being my normal self. About a month ago I switched to generic escitalopram and now I am noticing I am not as happy and I am having anxiety symptoms again. I am going back to brand name immediately. I don&#039;t care what anyone says brand is better than generic and there is a difference.""",7
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had Nexplanon inserted on 2 Sept 2013 and its the first method of birth control I&#039;ve tried. I&#039;d read where it is the most reliable, so went for that option. No pain during insertion or afterwards. Only had a period the first month and nothing since then which feels a little odd but is also bliss! Completely forget it&#039;s even in my arm most of the time, however my moods are horrendous, I cry far more than I ever used to, I snap at people and I never used to, I feel very anxious or conscious and often feel exhausted. I don&#039;t know if these are side effects of Nexplanon as I&#039;m in my final year at uni so it could be stress etc., but I&#039;d imagine it is the increased hormones. All in all I&#039;d say I&#039;ve had a good experience most of the time.""",8
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I was 19 years old when my family doctor prescribed me Xanax 0.25mg. for my stress and anxiety from work and life at the time. I&#039;m 43 now I only take it when I&#039;m under a lot of stress or when my anxiety level goes up in any situation in my life. At the same time when I&#039;m stressed out I go walking and running because it helps too. I wouldn&#039;t know what I would do if I didn&#039;t have Xanax to help me.""",7
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had sleep issues my whole life and had just sort of dealt with it.  I finally spoke with a Dr. about it and was prescribed Lunesta.  Over a couple of weeks, taking it ~3 nights a week, I was sleeping better for the most part. Then, my emotions started going haywire.  I was quick to anger and feeling paranoid.  I was convinced my wife was having an affair (she wasn&#039;t) and had multiple outbursts.  I have never been on any sort of medication for a period of time, so I didn&#039;t think to blame the Lunesta.  I stopped taking it and the crazy emotions have stopped.""",0
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I have been on nuvaring for about 6 years. 
PROS: I&#039;ve never gotten pregnant. My boobs went up 2 cup sizes. its not uncomfortable at all. It regulated my period. Much easier than the pill, you put it in, then you can forget about it for 3 weeks. But the BEST THING for me was that it cleared my acne. 

CONS: I am moody, more depressed, will cry for any little thing. I have always been 110 pounds my whole life with tiny fluctuations now I&#039;m heading towards 125 pounds! No sex drive at all. Broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years because we never had sex. It gives me constant BV and daily vaginal discharge which is the worst side effect to me. 
 
I have decided to stop it. I&#039;m sick of having BV, and I don&#039;t want to gain any more weight.""",8
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been on quite a few different kinds of medications for anxiety and depression, but I&#039;ve never had a reaction quite like I did with this one. Within hours of taking it for the first time, I began to feel nauseous, drowsy, uncoordinated, shaky; my vision was blurry and I couldn&#039;t drive a car. These symptoms persisted until I stopped the medication. I tried it once or twice after stopping the first time, and the horrible symptoms came right back. I couldn&#039;t even do my work. If you have any sensitivities to this medication I would not recommend it. I&#039;m no doctor, but even I know when a pill isn&#039;t worth the risk.""",7
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I started this medication yesterday. 1st day was great, I felt alert and motivated. On the 2nd day, I could not focus very well, once I realized I can&#039;t focus I started getting stressed and then out of no where I felt great sadness come over me and cried for two hours.  This medication clearly altered my emotional state.  Pros- lasts throughout the day, does suppress appetite for those of us looking to shed few pounds.""",1
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I was out on a very low dose for unexplained right upper quadrant pain. I can not believe the difference this has made. Not only for the pain, but I was also starting to go into depression because they can&#039;t figure out what is causing my pain. After being hospitalized my gastro recommended I try it along with getting into pain management. I very rarely have to take a pain pill. I actually went 2 weeks without a pain pill. I&#039;m very pleased with my results.""",9
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Just scheduled an appointment to have the nexplanon removed out of my arm. Not only has this medicine completely destroyed my libido, it has put a complete strain on my relation due to my refusal for affection. I used to love affection and I was such a loving person. Now, I can&#039;t even stand to be touched. I&#039;m so emotional and hormonal it&#039;s unreal. My mood changes so quickly. I go from cry to screaming to happy within ten minutes. Also my period has not stopped and it&#039;s so heavy I change my tampon atleast every hour. I have spent more money on tampons in the past three months than I have in my entire life of buying them seeing that I go through a box every two days. I spend about $75-$80 on tampons. I&#039;d rather take my chances with condoms.""",8
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve had severe anxiety and depression for many years and have tried many meds. For me, BuSpar wasn&#039;t very effective, even at the maximum dose of 60mg/day. It also caused me very restless legs at night, which was extremely troublesome. I couldn&#039;t lie still for even ten seconds. I also got brain zaps. My doctor thinks I should remain on BuSpar, so these days I take only 10mg/day as a backup to my other meds. I don&#039;t have the side effects at the lower dose.""",7
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on latuda for about two months. I had been taking Risperdal and Lamictal for years and while I was getting by I wasn&#039;t in such a great mood often. Shortly after taking this I noticed I felt much happier and my therapist and girlfriend both said I seem less inhibited and in a better mood. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m manic and I don&#039;t feel like the happiness is some artificial shot in the arm. I&#039;m perfectly lucid and at peace with things most of the time. That all being said I also have more frequent mood swings. The swings aren&#039;t as bad as when I&#039;m off meds, but I do feel pretty down about 10 to 20 times a month with episodes lasting various amounts of time. I&#039;m currently taking 20mg latuda and 300mg Lamictal.""",6
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I just want say this medication has been a complete life saver for me I went from having bad anxiety and just generally crappy attitude of always being upset and grumpy and ocd on other peoples character defects until i started taking this medication which at first was hard the first 2 -3 days were rough and than I decided to cut the 10mg pill in half and thats when I noticed my change I was just genuinely happy about just being alive and happy about starting my day things I would usually get upset and obsess about just roled off me like no big deal and I found now that I am able to carry on and have a regular great day so thank you so much to my doc and Lexapro for being a solution for now and maybe for my lifetime if need be""",5
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I have been on Cymbalta (30mg) for a three week trial for treating my anxiety, depression and fibromyalgia. Thought it sounded like a miracle pill since I&#039;m only 21 years old, but this has caused everything from headaches to stomach pain to diarrhea. I figured I could live with that and let it run its course but things got worse. I noticed my anxiety attacks got much worse and became more frequent, had to go the ER last night because my hands, feet, tongue, ears, face went numb and swelled. Now I&#039;m on steroids and Benadryl to bring it down. """,7
Trazodone,Depression,"""I was put on Trazodone for depression after other antidepressants began giving me restless legs syndrome. It has been great for both sleep and depression. I am having side effects of stuffy nose and sore muscles. Also having some loss of bladder control when I sneeze or cough from it. Overall it has been the best one I have tried so far for depression. It lets me sleep, whereas before I would have non stop thoughts keeping me awake.""",5
Strattera,ADHD,"""Started taking  60mg of this medicine for ADD &amp;  anxiety triggered my ADD. 
It took about a week to hit my system, while it helped somewhat with my ADD. It wasn&#039;t major. I was still forgetting things like crazy and was able to be side tract. 

It&#039;s been 13 days and I&#039;m stopping it today. 
It has made me an emotional WRECK!!!! I&#039;ve had CRAZY mood swings like seen in a damn horror movie.
Yesterday, I woke up happy then saw puppy shit on the floor and I LOST IT. 
I was a crying wreck. It was so bad I laid on my floor and screamed tears! I&#039;ve never been depressed insane. 
Couldn&#039;t find my shoes- crying screaming mess again. 
Left the laundry in the washer over night- another HUGE breakdown.""",1
Tramadol,Depression,"""TEARS of joy! OMG! Thank you all!! I started Tramadol after my back surgery, I begged my Dr. to get me off hydrocodone after 20 years, no more nonnarcotics, this was for personal reasons, I enjoy sitting in my chair every day watching TV, I THOUGHT I was as good as it gets!! I accepted life as that, but... all of a sudden, I found myself off the chair cleaning, doing things, happy, doing wonderful, not enough of pain control, I experimented with doses, after 3 months I made a mistake and ran out 5 days early, OMG! This is how I realized that the Tramadol is what made me a person again, and your comments made it SO! I am 58 yrs. woman, disabled, takes 100 mg Zoloft everyday, now I am alive!""",5
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""In reading through these reviews I really was very skeptical. But.. After close to 1 month I actually have the feeling as described &quot;the veil has lifted&quot; I really feel better!! The increased hunger has subsided, I did cope with that by eating lots of oranges and apples(very filling)! I sleep good and I wake up feeling rested. So... please do not give up.It does work. Concentrate on the good, not the side effects.""",5
Symbyax,Depression,"""I was self medicating myself after my mom passed away. I was abusing pain pills, I had panic attacks and stayed depressed. I was mean and thought everyone was out to get me, bad with money and did not have time for my wife and two boys. I stayed ill but after a week of taking it I changed on happy no more mood swings. My wife said she can tell a big difference we always together now and I get along with everyone feel way better the only bad it&#039;s hard to get off during sex, everything works fine just can&#039;t finish not sure why.""",5
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I would give cymbalta a 10/10 however I have not been on it long enough to give it a perfect score. I have tried Prozac as well as wellbutrin to help cope with my crippling depression but they just didn&#039;t do the job. Before cymbalta I was easily aggitated, hating the world around me, and contemplating suicide. Now it is like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I&#039;m not irritated by small things anymore. I have more motivation. The only downside is have had is some insomnia but it should pass. Don&#039;t be scared by all the negative reviews. I was until I took it for myself. Everyone is different however you will have to try it for yourself to know. I take 30 milligrams once a day in the morning.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Adipex on 3/21/12. My starting weight was 271.5. Today is 4/25/12 and I weigh 258lbs. I&#039;ve lost a total of 13.5 lbs. I&#039;m certain I could&#039;ve lost WAY more. After over a month, I still have 1/2 a bottle left. The side effects of the pill (rapid heart beat, dizziness from not eating..etc) brought out my pre-existing anxiety issues. I stopped taking it for 2 weeks and got back to eating wrong but I started again a little over a week ago and I&#039;m losing like CRAZY! I weigh everyday and the number keeps getting smaller (side effects are GONE). I sometimes skip a pill, but I still don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m starving like I used to. Will continue to take it until I reach 145lbs. I haven&#039;t exercised, but I did purchase the INSANITY workout and will start soon.""",3
Nucynta,Pain,"""I was having pretty severe post surgical pain. Oxycontin gave me a pounding headache and caused depression and insomnia. Tramadol did not help. I started taking Nucynta 50mg yesterday. I must say it on a scale of 1 to 10 my pain is now a negative 10! When it wears off its pretty sharp and uncomfortable. Taking 1 50mg tab every 4-6 hours. Dr said I can take 2 pills but haven&#039;t needed to. I recommend this for anyone who has issues with the usual pain medicines. I have also been drinking prune juice because it does have constipation effect.""",9
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was given Rx for lamictal when we finally discovered I had cyclothymic disorder vs. Generalized AD and MDD. I felt great on effexor xr for awhile, then was having severe anxiety  (I thought) which turned out to be a bipolar episode.  We added lamictal and decreased my effexor from 300mg to 150mg. Now I am able to recognize my cycles and take 150mg of effexor from October to march then 75mg effexor March to October. I take 150mg lamictal all year and 1mg klonopin at bedtime every night to sleep. I  am also allowed 1 klonopin daily as needed but rarely need to use that. Lamictal  is my wonder drug!!! After suffering for 20 years trying to figure out the right combination of meds to feel good I  am on track!""",6
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I am looking for a jump start on my weight loss and my Dr. prescribed Belviq for 60 days. I started taking the pills 7/31/15 and return to the Dr.today 8/7/15 and have lost 1lb.
I was 360lb and now 359lbs. I only take 1 per day because I was afraid of side effects reviews I read.
I&#039;m not a diabetic and have not had any side effects.
So far so good. And planning overtime to increase to 2 pills per day.""",2
Aviane,Birth Control,"""Amazing! It broke me out the first two months, but by now, at month six, my skin has been completely clear. I use to struggle with PMDD, which gave me really bad depression around my period. Now, I feel so much more stable and my depression and mood swings are gone. No weight gain, I actually lost a few pounds. No bad side effects at all! Would recommend this to anyone if you&#039;re looking for birth control with only positive side effects. And of course, I have not gotten pregnant.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""Hello

Let me 1st say that I only gave it a 5 because its only been 4 days since I started the medication so I am still in the stage on taking only 1 per day. I have had zero side effects and I am grateful for it. I will admit to praying before I took the medications because I am determined to get this weight off. I have envision myself at a certain weight and that is where I will be. I also have had 3 drinks (wine) since I started and no effects there either. I have also craved coffee but just haven&#039;t gotten any yet. I went from being a everyday drinker 4 years ago to occasional. I just got off the scale (something is said I wouldn&#039;t do) and I am down 5lbs in just 4 days, stay hydrated! and let this thing work for you! I wish you all well.""",2
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Bipolar with mixed episodes, ADHD and severe anxiety. Saphris was a miracle for me also. I&#039;ve been on disability for 10 years and this is the first medicine I&#039;ve taken that has made me functional.  Absolutely can&#039;t take it the morning; it makes me incoherent for about 3 hours and I eat everything in sight.  So I take all 20 mgs at night and am doing fine.  Have mouth sores, though. My doctor said to alternate between taking it sublingually, supra lingually and but ally and it&#039;s helping. """,6
Topamax,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have taken Topamax for the last 8 months as a mood stabilizer. It has worked great, not only has it helped with my moods, but it also helped me lose more than 30 lbs without struggling to lose it. It was easy and great. I am happy again and I don&#039;t feel like I want to chew off everyone&#039;s head when I start to get irritable or around &quot;that time of month&quot;. It&#039;s been a life saver.""",6
Deplin,Depression,"""I hope this helps to all the depressed people out there. I have been seeing a psychiatrist for drug induced depression.  I abused meth, Vicodin, coke, and any other drug you can think of for years and that has left me a basket case. I have tried many antidepressants but I suffer too many adverse reactions for the stronger stuff. I am currently on 300mg Wellbutrin and 15 mg Deplin and I have to say I feel GREAT! However I had taken Wellbutrin/Deplin combo in the past and it stopped working for me after 6 months.  The results with the antidepressants were a little funny because I went back to abusing Vicodin. Now I am clean of any drugs and just taking what is prescribed by my doctor.  300mg Wellbutrin and 15 mg Deplin. """,5
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking this med for years and I feel trapped. I don&#039;t think it really does anything for me. The problem is that I tried to stop taking it and I became completely useless, tired, irritable, and full of anxiety. 
Right now I have not taken it for two days because I forgot it before I went out of town. I am tired, got insomnia and I feel like I am hung over and nauseous.
The withdrawals from taking this medication is awful. So I think anyone that wants to start this med should seriously consider this when making a decision to ingest this.
I am not the only one who has experienced this. There is a lot about withdrawing from this med on the net.""",6
Vicoprofen,Pain,"""Pain problems started around 2005. Waking up one night with excruciating pain, crawling on the floor to get around in morning. It got better through out the day, but it reset over night. I dealt with this my last year in high school and a few years through college till I could finally afford some insurance and see a doctor. Turns out I had a really huge herniated disc in my L-6/L-7. Scared to get a surgery, since so &quot;young&quot; they&#039;d only prescribed low dose pain killers. Desperate I got surgery. Life was great since, however, I&#039;d suffered some nerve damage. Now take the 7,5 Vicoprofen for chronic headaches due to nerve damage, and it&#039;s amazingly quick to work and slow for tolerance, though it&#039;s inevitable. I now take 2 every 4-6 hour.""",9
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m 43 and have been at a stand still where my weight is concerned-I have reduced my sugar intake and all around carb intake-no longer really eat breads and I exercise about 4 days a week-wasn&#039;t really getting anywhere so I asked my doc to give me something as a jump start.  I started Belviq on 7.14 and now 14 days later I am down 9 pounds and I feel GREAT!  No side effects and I feel alert and in an Awesome  mood!  I&#039;m picking up my first month supply and can&#039;t wait to see the result after being on it for three months.  I&#039;m 5&#039;11 and started out at 215 and now at 206 and my plan is to get down to my goal weight of 175!  I&#039;ve never felt so great and energized and HOPEFUL!""",3
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""After later years of my adolescence and early adulthood I was finally diagnosed (bipolar) and prescribed Seroquel along with lithium. Not only did I finally feel a sense of peace within myself I found that I no longer engaged in the reckless activity that I seemed to have no control over. This behaviour which caused so much grief and upset, nearly caused the breakdown between my family and which I nearly destroyed myself. 
It does not get rid of my depression completely but they are not as bad and I find I can cope where as in the past I couldn&#039;t.
I find that it&#039;s best to take it before bed as it makes me very drowsy which I find a good thing because in the past I found it very difficult to sleep.
Hope this helps.""",6
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I didn&#039;t realize until i read these reviews why i was itching..but now i know!  thanks.  for the past two months while using this medicine i have definitely been focused on happier things and my day to day life as opposed to thinking constant thoughts of death and being overwhelemed with fear.  no side effects like i had with so many other drugs, and i tried them all.  so i am thankful my dr. recommended this to me.  everyone should try it.""",6
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""It has been approximately 3 months and I am down 12 lbs. The side effects are minor and well worth the loss of weight. Although the weight loss has been slow, I never felt deprived of food ONCE. I plan to stay on it for a year as I have another 40 lbs to go. This pill definitely decreases my appetite. I have experienced a few headaches and yes, the coughing, but compared to having a heart attack from being overweight, I am fine with that. If you are overweight, I think you should give this medication a try for at least a month or two. Also, never felt jittery at all on this. The biggest downside is the cost. I think that is part of the plan - it costs so much that you can&#039;t afford food after paying for it. They offer a $75 off coupon.""",3
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""My son started taking this at 6, he was violent with family members, and would not pay attention in class, refusing to do homework, sometimes hitting other kids. He had never been  on any other behavior modification medication before. We noticed a big difference when he started taking Focalin XR. His teacher started sending home good notes. He was doing well in school, but by the time he got home the medication had worn off, and we were dealing with the same problems. Now he has been on it for 2 months, it seems as though his body has just gotten used to the medicine and his former behavior had taken over. Now we are consulting his Doctor to see if the medication needs to be increased, or where to go from here.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Been on Adipex-p for 28 days and have lost 20 pounds. Doctor put me on it because I am menopausal and have a hard time losing weight. First week had a hard time sleeping but now no problems, I check my blood pressure daily and no issues there. Definitely get dry mouth with it that has been my only issue, I usually chew gum and keep a drink handy. Glad I was given this drug, doubt I would have lost what I did without it.""",3
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I had tried many medications to level out my bipolar disorder and relieve my GAD and it seemed that when I would get one symptom straight one of the others would reappear. Years it took, eventually my doc decided to try something new when the depression hit and nothing seemed to be helping. So I started trileptal, which helped noticeably but I wasn&#039;t sleeping so he recommended saphris to help me sleep, I was a little apprehensive but desired to feel better so I agreed to try it. I am beyond satisfied with it. I feel better than I have been in as long as I remember. I am back in school full time and working full time without the edginess if mania. I feel like myself again. My friends and family have commented on how well I seem to be.""",6
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""i have been using &quot;victoza&quot; for almost a month now and i felt so much better.i used to have A LOT of cravings but now i barely have any.i started at 0.6 and 1 time a day but now i noticed by late night it has worn off ,so i will see if i can make 2 times a day.i felt a little queezy at first but now i feel great. i noticed that when i eat greasy foods it goes thru me,but i know not to eat that...i wiould give it a try before deciding if it is for you.some doctor&#039;s have samples you can try and i go to dr&#039;s in 2 days to find out how much i weigh.wish me good luck i can&#039;t wait till i see how i am doing.best thing is my medical covered it when using it as victoza and not the other one saxenda. same drug 2 different brands names smart people.""",2
Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was recently diagnosed with bipolar and began taking 25-50mgs a night to aid insomnia because at the time I felt relatively well. I appear to be one of the few to embrace the side effect of increased appetite, when I&#039;m manic, depressed or even the slightest bit anxious my appetite disappears. I can go weeks without feeling the need to eat and I love eating! I used to smoke alot of pot to help with my appetite and racing thoughts. I&#039;m now taking 150mg XR at night as I&#039;m currently having a mixed episode. It helps quieten my mind and slows me down a little but I don&#039;t feel in any way zombified, at night soon after taking I get sleepy but that&#039;s about it!""",6
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I took Ambien for a couple of nights, great drug, really works, slept like a baby deeply. Felt drugged the next day but I&#039;m very sensitive to these feelings. Then I decided to not take it again, and had &quot;rebound insomnia&quot; the first night, that was last night. Today I feel very tired after getting maybe 1 or 2 hours of sleep last night. I&#039;m going to try everything I know to get a good nights sleep tonight. Usually I do not need any sleep aids at all. Only took it recently because my sleep got messed up after a travel and being in a difficult place to sleep.""",0
Differin,Acne,"""I really wanted to believe that this would get rid of my acne, but unfortunately it hasn&#039;t. I was prescribed the creme about three or four months ago and have been applying this to my face every night, but it hasn&#039;t really helped clear my acne nor my acne scars. The first month it seemed to clear up my skin a tiny bit, but not significantly. After that, my skin returned to the same state as before I started Differin - maybe even worse. I&#039;m so bummed, I just need a miracle to make me feel good about myself again ... Can&#039;t even look in the mirror without feeling disgust.""",4
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Lamictal for approximately a month now for bipolar 1, slowly working up to what I am now at 100mg. I have noticed a dramatic drop in depression but hypo mania only slightly changed, I think it only feels like it has worsened because the depression isn&#039;t there to bring me back down, I still can&#039;t sleep at night, I still panic, feel the doom of anxiety, and racing thoughts among other things. I have had an incredibly increased libido, overall I can&#039;t believe how well its working in such a short time without the terrible side effects that other medications can give you. I&#039;m a mom of 4, I have no time to be a zombie, confused, tired and slow, I look forward to seeing the next few months.""",6
Klonopin,Bipolar Disorde,"""Clonazepam is very effective in controlling agitation and providing much needed rest for bipolar disorder. It takes away the racing thoughts and irritability associated with mania. I also suffer from very intense anxiety and 1mg to 2mg/day allow me to be functional without clouding my mind. I prefer Klonopin to Xanax or Ativan because it lasts longer (up to 12 hours) and I don&#039;t feel the craving between doses. Withdrawal from clonazepam is not as hard as some people say, it must be gradual. If that doesn&#039;t work, ask your physician to switch clonazepam to its equivalent in diazepam. I found it easier to reduce my clonazepam doses from 3mg/day to 1mg than to stop taking 200mg quetiapine/day.""",6
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""This was very, very good. I have MDNOS (Mood Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) however, it is likely that I have Bipolar 2 Disorder, and my doctor has used the terms hypomania and major depression to describe elements of my condition. I also experience some anxiety.

I tried Zoloft before, but as many people with Bipolar Disorders know, that can lead to some bad things happening. I had significant side effects and it made me irritable. 

When I got to Lamictal, I immediately noticed how much better things were. First, I began to feel less depressed, and I noticed that I had virtually no side effects. I have never even heard of a psych medication with no side effects (for me at least). It worked well for all of my problems.""",6
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I could always fall asleep, but could not stay asleep.  Three hours a night was normal.  I needed help and Ambien, etc. were harsh.  The doctor suggested trazodone and I tried it.  She said it might take time to work- but that first night I slept 9 hours.  I&#039;ve been taking it for four years and it changed my life.  No side effects except for drowsiness on days 1-2 and if I&#039;m off of it for any time.  I take 50 mg and am a 200lb healthy male.  This medicine is under-prescribed for this indication.""",0
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""My son was diagnosed with Autism, however he has symptoms of ADHD but is not. The ADHD meds. just made things worse for him so the Dr. gave me Strattera to try 10mg and it helped, I kept wondering why he could take this but not other ADHD meds. his pediatrician told me it is an antidepressant that was discovered to have a calming effect, and if it makes him tired take it at bedtime. It is very expensive but helps we have not been able to increase the dose, but kids on the spectrum are difficult to medicate.""",1
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been taking Belviq for 1 week, I haven&#039;t lost any weight yet. I do believe it&#039;s helping me not crave sweets! I have a major sweet tooth &amp; after 1 day on Belviq I have had no cravings for the sweets. I do have dry mouth so drinking a lot of water which is a +! Also I&#039;m very tired, it&#039;s all I can do to get through work. Hoping I start to feel better, I can&#039;t take much more of this tiredness. I hope I start seeing the scale go down.""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking lamictal for my unspecified bipolar disorder a few weeks ago. The results have been remarkable, I could feel the medication start work a few hours after the first dose and it was definitely more than just a placebo effect. I was less flighty and everything just seemed brighter and clearer. My thinking has cleared up and my mood is well controlled even while traveling, which is when hypomania usually sets in for me.""",6
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I wasn&#039;t too over-weight, but my weight was clearly going to get out of hand if I didn&#039;t do something about it. I was about 30 pounds to big (197 pounds).  My goal is 167.  I asked my doctor to prescribe Qsymia; now, I&#039;m 174 after 3 months. My body weight scale just reported that I&#039;m in the &#039;normal&#039; range for BMI. I know BMI doesn&#039;t mean too much, but it felt good. I would like Qsymia to help me fend off routine eating, so I can maintain 167 for long periods of time... that&#039;s the goal at least.  
I have to buy new pants now..""",3
Ketorolac,Pain,"""I have fibromyalgia and severe costochondritis, dx&#039;d in 2010. After nearly a week of a nasty pain flare and then I fell. That just made it worse, the last straw. So I went to emergency room. 

Was absolutely shocked they couldn&#039;t (by Canadian law) give opioids or anything like that for pain relief when my pain was nearly 3x it usually is. Felt like I totally wasted my time calling the ambulance and waiting for hours to see the emerg doc.

Then he offered Toradol and I got a shot of it soon thereafter. I was amazed how it worked, my pain literally just drained away within 10 mins or less. I had not felt that close to being pain free in well over a decade. I cried tears of disbelief and joy. Getting it in pill form asap!""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This my second round with Phentermine.  I tried it a couple of years ago and lost 20 pounds and have kept it off.  I decided I needed to lose 20 more, so I&#039;m back on it as of yesterday.  I&#039;m already down 2 pounds!   My appetite is virtually gone!  I feel really good and have so much energy!  The only down side is insomnia, but I can live with that as long as I&#039;m getting great results!""",3
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""The Unisom Tabs 25 MG does not work for me even if I take 2 tablets.  I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea about 5 years ago and have gone from taking the  of the &quot;Z&quot; pill (6 MG) to taking the extended release &quot;Z&quot; pill (12.5 MG).  Decided to try to wean myself off for the past week by taking only half a dose of the &quot;Z&quot; pill and amazing that worked.  Now, trying the Unisom Tabs and trying to give it a week before I refill the &quot;Z&quot; tabs.  As I sit here, I am tired on night 2, but still don&#039;t think I am tired enough to fall asleep.""",0
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""After going through hell using anti depressants I finally went to a specialist for anxiety. She did a DNA test to see what drugs would best work for me. I take one Clonazepam along with a Gabapentin in the am and then a second Gabapentin in the afternoon. It truly has been a life saver for me when nothing else worked for PSTD/anxiety. No side effects whatsoever. Be very careful with alcohol. Instead of three beers make it one.""",7
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""Update to my weight loss experience, I&#039;m 51, 5&#039;5&quot; female, 3 kids, started Qysmia 9/9/13 at 198 lbs.  This morning, Nov. 7, I weighed in at 173 lbs. Lost 25 lbs in 2 months!   Eating 1200 calories a day, drinking lots of diet tea.  Still have occasional tingling in toes, but thats it.  Weight loss is about a pound a week but thats probably the healthiest way to go and I&#039;m not feeling hungry or deprived.  I eat what I want, just less, BUT drink a BIG glass of tea before eating!  Cost - yes expensive - but you&#039;re cutting back calories so it is the cost of one Big Mac Meal or its equal.  I&#039;m VERY happy with my results!!!""",3
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m a 26 year old active female struggling to lose weight due to my PCOS. In three months on this drug I lost 4 lbs, the fact that I lost weight at all is the reason I am giving two instead of one star. However, I changed my diet and I started running 5-10 miles a week so I&#039;m not sure the weight loss had anything to do with the drug at all.

I will, however, vouch for the appetite suppression. I can&#039;t eat nearly as large of portions at meals and I do think I would eat less if I only ate when hungry but the problem is that, because I exercise frequently , if I don&#039;t force myself to eat I am extremely exhausted and lethargic. Also the side effects are real, foot and leg tingling, and short term memory issues were both things I experienced""",3
Tramadol,Pain,"""I think this stuff works great as long as ur not a habitual user of the stronger pain killers. I&#039;m allergic to NSAIDs and aspirin so I can pretty much only take Tylenol and the occasional cox 2 inhibitor (Celebrex, vioxx, bextra). I took Tylenol and Celebrex yesterday for leg pains and got no relief. Used Tylenol today. No relief. I took a 50mg tramadol and pain gone!!! I have a high tolerance for certain meds but for pain, I&#039;m an over the counter kinda gal. This is great for single doses! Maybe not for daily regime :-/.""",9
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I was recently in the hospital for a cyst that ended up being MRSA. It was one of the most painful things I&#039;ve been through and it took 3 days in the Hospital with Antibiotics and IV Pain Meds (Dilaudid) to get me stable enough to go home. I was on 4mg of Dilaudid IV every 2 hours. For me, about 1 1/2 hours after getting the Dilaudid push I was starting to get in pain again. When I got it though, my pain instantly disappeared and I could get some rest. I can&#039;t take Morphine because it makes me vomit. This medicine was my lifesaver! The only thing is it made me itch so the doctor gave me Benadryl with every dose. Had no problem after that.""",9
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I have been taking Belviq for 39 days and I am down 18 pounds. I am just plain not hungry and when I eat my meals, I am full much faster. I have forced myself not to eat cookies or pastries and after the first week, I have no desire for them at all. I eat kind bars and a banana for lunch (sometimes a low fat cheese stick). if I am hungry,   I may eat my banana midday.  I eat a regular dinner, just smaller amounts and absolutely no fast food.  If I work a long day and I am tired, we will have Subway for dinner.  I hope this continues on the right path for me...fingers crossed.""",2
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking lunesta on and off for &gt;8 months. This drug is very effective as it puts you to sleep twenty minutes after taking the pill. I can get six hours of straight sleep and a plus of one hour more, after waking up to urinate. So I went from having a extremely poor sleep calendar because of a fibromyalgia type disease, to getting this 6-7 hs of sleep at night which is actually very good.

Why I don&#039;t rate higher this drug? Well: If I take the eszopiclone at 00:00 Hs and wake up at 8:00 Hs, there exist a residual effect of drowsiness that last well into the midday. It dissapears only at 17:00 Hs aprox. This is incompatible with a calendar of morning study or working. Furthermore, this side effect can lead to or aggravete depression.""",0
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""This med has let me finally get a good nights sleep.I&#039;m taking 50 mg every night.It&#039;s been a long road for me I&#039;ve multi-fractured all 12 of my thoracic vertebrae and ripped out a plate in my left arm (from a previous car accident)and had a total left shoulder replacement because I had a seizure in my sleep.The pain meds I&#039;m on know are the 100 mcg fentanyl patch,and dillauded along with Keppra ,vimpat,klonopin and celexa.With all those meds I had a hard time trying to sleep now I don&#039;t.""",0
Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Started out on 300 mgs 1 x per day. Can&#039;t say it helped or didn&#039;t. The dose was lowered to 75 mgs at one point to see if it was the reason for my memory loss. Supposedly I had an acute stroke with partial blockage in my neck. I have been on it 15 years doctors recomendations. Last 7 years have been on 150 mg&#039;s 1 x per day. Mind comes and goes. Sometimes I can&#039;t remember my husbands name. I had no visual signs of stroke. They said it was an old stroke I never noticed. I also take xanax 2 mgs per day. Gabapentin 300 mgs per day. Geodon 40 mgs per day. Bisoprolol 10 mgs 1 x a day. Diabetic. Take insulin. Anxiety is gone. I do need to figure out what is causing my memory to come and go. Wondering if anyone else has this problem on Effexor ER.""",6
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""Though the medication helped my depression, I  (a 20 year old female) started having incredibly painful acid reflux and heartburn after just a month or 2 of taking it. The acid reflux has dissipated since switching to different medication, but I still have bouts of it from the harm it caused to my stomach. I had never experienced any type of heartburn or acid reflux before being prescribed this drug.""",5
Duac,Acne,"""I have always have the odd few spots but being 28 and just breaking out in acne 6 months before my wedding was a bit of a shock. The doctors prescribed me Duac and within two days I noticed a difference and felt I could leave the house without foundation for the first time in months. The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced is slightly itchy and dry skin. I don&#039;t mind this as the spots were painful and for the first time I can put moisturising cream on my face.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started phentermine right before thanksgiving.  I am 5&quot;2&#039; and starting weight was 184lbs.  It made me not hungry at all.  I constantly drank water and ate very lightly.  No insomnia first month.  I lost 17 pounds.  Second month I had to take 3 days off because of the insomnia.  If I feel I can&#039;t sleep I will skip a day or two.  Still only drinking water and eating lightly.  No exercise at all and today I weigh 156lbs.  Total loss of 28lbs in two months.  This month I plan to add exercise to drop more weight. Love Phentermine!""",3
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on Belviq for almost 2 weeks. I read all the reviews here before I started, hoping to get a better idea of what it&#039;s like. The most important thing I want to stress is this pill works but only if you put the effort into eating healthy and gradually add exercise. By about the 8th day I really noticed my appetite decreasing. My mood is way better and the tiredness I felt the first week is gone. I tried one pill a day but felt like it works better with two. I&#039;m on day 12 and down 10 pounds. Do your research, talk to your Dr. It doesn&#039;t have phentermine. It seems to work like an SSRI except it&#039;s hitting an area that controls hunger. I sleep better, feel better, and would recommend Belviq to change your relationship with food!""",3
Adapalene,Acne,"""There&#039;s not much I can say because I haven&#039;t hit the 8 to 12 week mark but I don&#039;t have that long and I&#039;ve been using adapalene 0.3% in combination with doxycycline 150 mg for 5 weeks and I&#039;m looking worst than I did before I began. It&#039;s definitely not the doxycycline because I&#039;ve been prescribed doxycycline before and it worked wonders until about 2 months after I was done taking it. I have a wedding in 3 weeks so I&#039;m just going to stop using it until after the wedding. Hopefully this will give my skin time to heal before then because as of right now my self esteem is at an all time low and I&#039;m looking a handsome mess!""",4
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I took Trileptal from Feb 2015 to Dec 2015 - now weaning off it to lithium. I LOVED the way Trileptal handled my bipolar depression. I felt alert, alive, just really great. Unfortunately, a fall in August alerted my doctor to my bones being weakened. Also, I have optic neuritis in my left eye starting in July. Between those two side effects, we&#039;ve decided to taper off the trileptal and return to lithium. I&#039;m sad to stop it but the soft bones and eye issues are too great a problem to continue it.""",6
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""This is working great. I read about it in Oprah Winfrey&#039;s O Magizine. Asked my Doctor if it was right for me and he agreed. Losing 5lbs per week (on it for three weeks) I need to get my insurance company to pay and have called them about it asking for it to be considered. Either way I am breaking even as I have no constant hunger pangs. I feel satisfied with small portions, this must be how fit people feel. Good luck with your weight loss journey.  Thanks.""",3
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Had since 10/15. Definitely works as birth control. But thats only when I can give it the purpose of being birth control. I&#039;ll have a heavy period for a week to a week and a half then it&#039;ll break for a couple days, then I&#039;ll start again, but lighter. Then break for a couple days, then start again but lighter. this will keep going for a few weeks until I&#039;ll be free for maybe a week, until it starts again from the top. I haven&#039;t had some of the more severe side effects, but it seems to be an inconvenience when I have to worry about if Im bleeding through my pants, especially when it&#039;s summer and I&#039;m always out and about or working, and I dont always remember to grab tampons or pantiliners. it was pretty regular the first few months though...""",8
Aldactone,Acne,"""I am almost 46 and for 30 years have tried everything for chronic hormonal acne (antibiotics, Accutane, all the skin care lines, Retin A).  This medication has been a miracle for me.  I still get little blackheads / small pimples around my menses, but are barely noticeable. I continue on with my Retin A treatment which helps that. I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects.  I do watch my potassium intake (no bananas).""",4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking Phentermine for 6 months. I was 250lbs 5&#039;10&quot; male. One day got tired with shortness of breath just taking a shower, that opened my eyes that I needed help. Now I&#039;m 190lbs just taking this miracle medicine and just walk the dog type of exercise. Breakfast - Cheerios/2% lowfat milk and bagels with cream cheese. Lunch - chicken salad or shrimp salad with low fat dressing. Dinner - before 6pm - KFC grilled chicken 2pc. mash potatoes or rice. SNACK - 8pm any real fruit. AVOID ALL SODA EVEN DIET SODA, FRUIT DRINKS, ICE CREAM ANYTHING SWEET. &quot;WATER ONLY!&quot; It will be tough at first but stick to this for 1 month and you have survived. You WILL lose 10-15lbs. CHECK AND RECORD WEIGHT DAILY SAME TIME BEFORE BREAKFAST. GOOD LUCK.""",3
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""I took Paroxetine for 13 years, and I felt great all the time. It is wonderful for treating anxiety, but I took myself off it because I am on Tramadol and it warns not to take it with SSRI&#039;s since it could cause seratonin syndrome. I really miss it, but I had no other option. I need the Tramadol for spine pain. Don&#039;t know what to take in its place. By the way, neither my dr or my pharmacist worry about taking the two together, but I&#039;m 72 and I don&#039;t need any more problems.""",7
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I truly believe that Xanax has been the ONLY medication that has worked for my anxiety and depression....any other anxiety/depression prescription that I have been on never really worked, I would be shaky a lot, tired all the time, and I never just felt sane or content. I have been prescribed Zoloft, Paxil, and even Abilify but none of those worked! Xanax is what worked for me and it calms me down every time I need it, and that is a lot because I am easily upset and can easily become stressed out. This is a miracle medicine, it really is!""",7
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on this medication for about two weeks.  5mg in the morning and at night.  I also take Topamax 125 mg twice a day.  Remereon, 30 mg at night.  Klonopin 0.5 twice a day as needed.  I feel the Saphris calms me down but after my nightly dose, I get the hunger pains very bad and I eat and eat.  This is not good for me.  In the morning it is very hard to wake up and my sleep is not very deep.   I was on Seroquel in the past, a small dose at night and my hunger was not this bad and my sleep was better.  I hope being on Seroquel will work again.""",6
Tapentadol,Pain,"""My Pain mgt. doctor switched me from Demerol to Nucynta for break-through pain of chronic migraines.  Surprisingly, I found it to be effective, but I noticed from the start that it greatly diminished my language skills:  reading, writing, and speaking.  As per doctor&#039;s orders I stayed in bed while under the effects of Nucynta so this weird side effect didn&#039;t cause me any issues.
     Until...After using it for 15 months, I found my language skills to be extremely loopy, creating comments from friends and neighbors, DAYS after taking Nucynta. That scared me and my doctor immediately took me off this medicine when I finally advised her of the language problem it presented.  I could be reading a sentence and forget a word&#039;s meaning.""",9
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""On rare occasions when it put me to sleep it gave me a steady stream of mini, vivid nightmares that had me awaken to a  depression.  Sometimes I&#039;d have the steady, mini vivid dreams lucidly, always conscious and knowing what side I was lying on, and then drag through the next day exhausted.  But most of the time no sleep nor vivid dreams; nada.  But the worst thing about Belsomra is its constellation of side effects: stiff muscle tone with unexpected contractions and coordination problems, crazy-bad depression, irritability, confusion and memory problems.  Beware.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started this on 8/11 at 274.4 lbs (female 5&#039;6&quot;) and today I am down 4 pounds to 270.4lb. The first day I felt like a tweaker, and had nausea in the morning but I realized it was another medicine I take also making me sick, so today I felt fine. I got a normal lunch portion, and 1/4 of the way through I was done. I haven&#039;t thought about food at all. I&#039;ve made a conscious effort to lower my carb intake to try to get the best results. I had already changed my lifestyle before starting this medicine which I feel will continue to give me better results. It will make you very thirsty so plan on spending a lot of time in the bathroom and refilling your water. I will check back in at the end of the month! Super excited for this little boost!""",3
Accutane,Acne,"""I want to start off by saying, this is a miracle pill. I&#039;ve suffered from acne since I have been in 7th grade (12yrs). I remember running into bathroom stalls to powder my face. Only hoping one day i would pass the &quot;puberty&quot; phase. However, here I was 19 graduating high school with worse acne. After years of treatment such as tropicals &amp; numerous antibiotics I decided to take on accutane. Two months into accutane, I am leaving my house with JUST BBCream. No concealer, no powder NOTHING. I wake up &amp; look into the mirror &amp; feel like crying from happiness. It&#039;s been two month &amp; I have another 3 to go. My journey has only begun and I can&#039;t believe these results. Only con is the chapped/dry lips. If you ask me it&#039;s all worth it""",4
Nortriptyline,Pain,"""I take Nortriptyline 30 mg at bedtime for facial nerve pain brought on by shingles, Post Herpetic Neuralgia.  The medication helps to stop itching, gnawing pain and electrical firing.  The one drawback for me is the constant obsession with food, mostly carbohydrates.  I&#039;ve gained weight and have negative sexual side effects, but hey,  I&#039;m not in pain.  It would be nice if there was another medication that worked as well as this medication for the pain, but doesn&#039;t have the side-effects.""",9
Sertraline,Depression,"""The Dr. prescribed this med after I developed a tolerance to Prozac after 15 wonderful years.  I started at 25 mg. They always say to give it a few weeks to see if it is working.  After 2 months he increased the dosage to 50 mg. which still did not work.  Then after an increase to 100 mg. for a few months, he finally believed it was not working for me.  He started me on Effexor, which took another 6 months of gradually increasing dosage to actually kick in.  Please do not give up.  After over a year of living a nightmare and feeling suicidal every single day, I&#039;m now back to normal, almost every day.""",5
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have been on tramadol for for years first giving to me for pain. It is an incredible pain medicine that gives me so much energy and makes my anxiety and occasional depression non existent, however, I have tried so many times to get off because I am now completely addicted. When I want to get off, even taper down enough to get off, I get the most horrible lightening zapping going thru my brain along with other withdrawals. It is an incredible drug for pain and depression BUT be careful if u stay on for a long period of time u will become a prisoner just like any other pain, depression medicine and the withdrawals are ugly.""",9
Pregabalin,Pain,"""I have been having pain for 5 months now after a bad dental experience. I thought it was my teeth that was causing all of my pain. I felt hopeless with no other options left. No dentists knew what to do. I went to my doctor and said I possibly have nerve damage from the numbing shot (I have permanent numbing too).  This medicine has taken away my tingling feeling from the numbing (although it&#039;s still numb, it&#039;s not annoying).  The shooting pain through my jaw is gone and my throbbing is gone too. WONDERFUL. I do feel a little dizzy and loopy but I&#039;m so happy.""",9
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I HAD BEEN ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT MEDS FOR DEPRESSION &amp; ANXIETY.  STARTING WITH PAXIL, PROZAC AND OTHERS I CAN&#039;T REMEMBER THE NAMES OF. I STARTED EFFEXOR A YEAR AGO AND IT CERTAINLY WORKS FOR ME, FOR BOTH DEPRESSION &amp; ANXIETY.  REMEMBER TO TAKE IT EVERYDAY. ALL SSRIs CAUSE SEVERE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS. IF YOU WANT TO DISCONTINUE USE, TELL YOUR DR.  COLD TURKEY IS NOT ONLY DEBILITATING IT IS DANGEROUS. I AM SO THANKFUL I HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED EFFEXOR. FINALLY RELIEF FROM THINGS THAT ARE NO BIG DEAL! WHERE AS BEFORE IN MY HEAD, IT WAS SO EXAGGERATED. I LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE STATED, I WISH THIS WAS AVAILABLE IN MY TEEN YEARS. I AM ENJOYING LIFE AND AM EXTREMELY HAPPY!""",5
Tramadol,Pain,"""I was prescribed  Tramadol to take together with Paracetamol for my chronic nerve pain. At first when I tried it, taking just one 50mg tablet it did almost nothing for me so I didn&#039;t bother taking it. Then later I tried taking 100mg together with Paracetamol and found it really helped and also improved my sense of well being, relaxation and general happiness. I take them only when necessary, and feel wary about taking it every day, because I&#039;ve read of serious addictions. I hope that taking it just three times a week will be fairly safe longer term.""",9
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have a fair amount of &quot;problems&quot;. Insomnia is one. I have MDD, GAD, PTSD. I take lexapro for depression and 1mg. twice a day of xanax. (You&#039;d think I&#039;d sleep from THAT)..NO...I also have SEVERE back/neck issues so I also take percocet 10s 4x day...STILL NO SLEEP. I tried them all...ambien...no...remeron...no. Serequel yes but hated the weight gain and could not function in morning,so my psych Dr said trazadone has been around forever no the effects...BS. It did NOT work AT ALL...was taking 50mg. So Dr said take 100mg...NOTHING but horrible headaches, severe nausea if I didn&#039;t eat enough, and once I finally managed to get 2-3hrs sleep it was NOT restful. Dr ALSO didn&#039;t tell me that their actually an antidepressant and take 4-6 weeks for maximum results""",0
Tramadol,Anxiety,"""I suffer chronic anxiety, negative thoughts and daily panic attacks. Have taken Xanax, Klonopin, Valium and Ativan. I can&#039;t believe it but Tramadol actually works better for anxiety than all these benzos put together. I haven&#039;t taken my daily 4mg of klonopin but am feeling fantastic and very chilled on Tramadol. They should approve this stuff for both Anxiety and Depression, it&#039;s incredible.""",7
Mirena,Birth Control,"""Out of the 5 people I know who have gotten this birth control, I am the only one who still has it in. I had it inserted 2yrs ago. The procedure itself was not bad. I have to say this is the worst birth control I have used.  The acne started first.  As soon as my periods stopped, the cramping started almost every day. Within the last 4 months I have gained a lot of weight. I am having terrible headaches and heartburn. I constantly feel bloated and all the weight I gained went straight to my stomach. I am puking, my breasts are incredibly sore. I feel like I&#039;m pregnant when I&#039;m not....mood swings, pain every day, urinary tract infections, etc. I am having it removed!""",8
Lutera,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Lutera for almost a year now. I&#039;ve been having birth control issues for about 2 years - first being on Mirena and having terrible cystic acne and depression, and then my doc recommended Lutera to add some hormones back into my system to help the acne. This is low dosage and although I&#039;ve seen my cystic acne go away (besides some coming at the time of the month) I still break out daily. I wanted to try it for longer than a few months, and I have to say out of the entire year, about 2 months of it I had decent skin. I break out on my face, back and shoulders and I haven&#039;t had this bad of acne since high school. After high school, I was on Ortho trycyclen and the nuva ring. Both of those didn&#039;t make me break out at all. I&#039;m 23, 145lb""",8
L-methylfolate,Depression,"""I have been on Deplin 15mg for about 3.5 months. I have the mutation and was hopeful that this would help. I noticed no change whatsoever in my anxiety or depression. I also started having severe joint pain and nothing had changed but adding Deplin. My doctor recommended that I stop the Deplin. I have been off for 3 days and continue to have joint pain. Would love to hear from others with a similar experience.""",5
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""Hi, I&#039;m from the UK. I have been taking  atomoxetine for roughly 5 months for my ADD which was diagnosed late. The medication had been ok. Recently it&#039;s impact on me has started to reduce. I feel that I am able to continue with tasks but am unable to apply focus on to the task. In other words I feel able to continue doing a thing but the quality of my effort seems diluted (beyond help). This is frustrating because I have to repeat things several times (such as reading things for my Masters degree). It has more or less ended other symptoms such as daydreaming, inability to continue at things, sleep problems, memory issues (though this to a smaller extent over time).I am going to get it changed though it works for some better than others.""",1
Minocycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m 29 and I&#039;ve suffered from acne for some years and NOTHING worked. Last choice I had was to go to my dermatologist and he prescribed me Solodyn. He said it may take a month before it starts to work. I broke out a few times but at 4 weeks my face was clearing up. My face was clear for 8 days then I ran out.  Had to wait a week for pills to be delivered (had to enroll to get my pills for $20.00) and since I&#039;ve been without the pills I only had two small pimples within 2 weeks. I got some more pills now and I love it. It&#039;s the best thing that ever happened to my face. I was prescribed with Ziana for the evening and Aczone for morning. My side effect on this was headache. And I got the 55mg.""",4
Tranylcypromine,Depression,"""I have been taking 20mg of Parnate every day for a little over a month now after finally convincing my Psychiatrist to prescribe it. I really can&#039;t say how effective it has been in terms of alleviating the symptoms of my depression. Diet restrictions have not really bothered me at all . No real physical side effects apart from extreme sun sensitivity. This REALLY bothers me because I&#039;m extremely fair skinned and burn so easily - frequent, and I mean FREQUENT reapplications of sunscreen and sun avoidance are a must for me. Parnate has also decreased the effectiveness of benzodiazepines such as valium and imovane. This has been really frustrating because I also suffer from anxiety and insomnia.""",5
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I had a back injury in the Marine Corp in 1989 I have had 7-9 on the pain scale for over 15 years. I have been on morphine 30mgs 6 times a day, Vicodin 10/325 for over six years oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl patches 150 mg every 72 hours, almost any pain medicine you can think of.  I stopped my Vicodin cold turkey after six years, If you have been on pain meds you know what withdrawal is and how painful it can be. I went right to gabapentin.  Oh My God thank you for this pill it is amazing, absolutely zero withdrawal effects from the Vicodin and I was on over 300 mg a day for six years.  I mean it zero withdrawal symptoms. I feel zero back pain and I mean zero. This pill is a miracle I&#039;m on 900 mg 3 times a day.""",9
Tramadol,Pain,"""Have Ledderhose syndrome for 12 years now. Had four growths removed and am on number 5 and 6 now. this is better the zapain. less side effects plus always a good up feeling. been on it 2 years after zapain for 8 years. I do live in the UK so have National health service . But I work 40 hours  a week in a casino. I had to change jobs from pitboss/ inspector to cashier  so I can sit down. Always cycled to work but have recently developed issues with my hip and back. So stay as active as possible. and good luck people""",9
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I recently had the implant put in and would like to share my first thoughts; I plan to do an update in 3-6 months. The initial pain of having the implant inserted was mild - I would rate it even less painful than a shot. Your arm will be sore for a few days and there will be bruising, but nothing to get excited about. It has now been 2 weeks and I can&#039;t even tell that it is there except when I feel for the implant on purpose. My doctor warned of immediate and persistent bleeding/spotting, but I haven&#039;t experienced that so far. I&#039;ve been losing weight for the past few months (on purpose) and haven&#039;t noticed a difference since the implant. No major issues with acne. Everybody is different, but don&#039;t let the negative reviews scare you!""",8
Gabapentin,Pain,"""Have been in a few wrecks and worked hard labour all my adult life.  I woke up one day and my back was so sore I couldn&#039;t tie my boots up. Since then I found out I have spinal stenosis. My legs burn all day I get sharp shooting pains sometimes I&#039;ll move the wrong way and my backs so bad I can&#039;t do nothing for 6 weeks just lay n heal.  Gabapentin worked very well for me stopped the sharp pain most of the time anyway..the burning was still there especially when I walked.  I tried a few opiates the only one that worked very well I can actually run and work hard again on them was dilaudid 8 mg.""",9
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been struggling with severe anxiety and depression since I was a child. I&#039;ve tried everything for anxiety: lexapro, Celexa, Effexor XR, Prozac, and Xanax. It&#039;s been the only medication that has really saved my life from this illness. Otherwise, if I don&#039;t take it, I won&#039;t be able work or live. I know that there is so much stigma about how it&#039;s addicting and it&#039;s abused. If you genuinely have a serious anxiety disorder, don&#039;t focus on the stigma. Take them! Or try to live the severe anxiety. You sort of have to pick your poison. I have never abused xanax. I started taking Klonopin for about a year, and was switched to xanax. I&#039;ve always taken my medicine as prescribed. Right now, I&#039;m taking .25 mg and it does wonders for me.""",7
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Started this less than week ago.  Only side effects have been some fatigue and dry mouth. The dry mouth has caused me to drink more water which is good for anyone.. I started at 214 and am already 210. I feel full far sooner than before and dont feel the cravings I would always get during the day.. hopefully the fatigue will pass next week. Recheck with doctor on 6/2... cant wait!  Sadly, I&#039;m a lapband failure and never get the I&#039;m full feeling with it, so this is promising!""",3
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""This is the worst birth control I have been on. I would not recommend this birth control to my worst enemy. I was on it for 3 months and had the worst mood swings, depression and worst acne that I still suffer from even after 2 months being off it. I never usually write reviews online but knew I had to warn anybody thinking about going on this product. I had such a clear face before I began this birth control, a few minor zits during my period but that&#039;s normal for anybody, but after this I still have red cystic acne... It&#039;s horrible. I used to be able to wear no makeup, no I can&#039;t even leave the house without makeup because I&#039;m too self conscious of my acne. DO NOT GO ON THIS BIRTH CONTROL.""",4
Opana ER,Pain,"""Opana ER is the 1st ER medication that I&#039;ve tried that actually works for an extended period of time. And I&#039;ve had to try many for my severe back and neck injuries. One 20mg pill will last at least 8 hrs, and I work long 16 hr days so that&#039;s a very good thing. I highly recommend it for people with severe problems/injuries. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend it for just mild to moderate pain problems or acute problems. Most ideal for people with chronic severe injuries who also work a lot.""",9
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""After months of sleepless nights, I finally went to the doc and was prescribed Amitriptyline about 6 or 7 days ago. The doc said not to skip a dose - to take it every night. It takes about 2 weeks to get into your system enough to work properly. Jury&#039;s still out, but it does not put me to sleep for several hours after taking it, and sometimes it doesn&#039;t work at all. I was wide awake at 5:30 a.m. morning before last. Last night I was asleep within an hour of laying down and slept until 11 a.m. this morning. Some days I feel groggy, and others I feel refreshed. My pain level has decreased drastically. Have bad, arthritic knees. Wondering if this drug helps relieve inflammation? I think it makes me calmer the day after. Still hoping.....""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on this for about a month, I was 345 lbs when I started and got as low as 317lbs. I have had headaches, no nausea, but I do feel tired all the time but I also have seasonal effective disorder which may play into it. I cheated a little by upping my dose every 5 days instead of every 7 but now i&#039;ve hit a plateau. I&#039;m hoping that I start losing again cuz so far this is the first time i&#039;ve been able to lose weight. This is my last hope. I haven&#039;t done any exercising because I&#039;m disabled &amp; its tough for me. I&#039;m hoping I can start once I lose more weight. It caused constipation &amp; diarrhea at times, I have gotten abdominal cramps if I try to eat to big of a portion or eat too frequently. I have noticed that I eat a lot less.""",2
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I have been on MS-Contin for 15 years.  In that time, only one dose increase!  I take 2x60 mg daily.  Every 2-3 months, my doc changes medicine.  I used to be able to get Opana, 40 mg 2x per day, and it worked great!  Even better was Efalgo, 16 mg 3 x per day.  2 in the morning, one at night.  Now, insurance will not pay for either.  The only medicine I can tolerate is Opana, 80 2x per day, and they really don&#039;t work well.  It is so frustrating that the medicine that is the hardest to tamper with, Efalgo, is the hardest to get and most expensive! If I don&#039;t switch every few months, I build up a tolerance. I suffer from degenerative disc disease in my lower back, arthritis etc.""",9
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""My 7.5 year old son has been taking 10mg Focalin for nearly a year.  Immediately it was a &quot;miracle&quot; for us.  He had good behavior marks in school, could finish his work and we were getting along better at home too.  About a month ago it seemed like maybe he had outgrown his dose, we upped it to 15mg.  Immediately again, great results.  But, we spent 4 hours in the ER tonight getting 2 EKGs &amp; xrays because of his chest pains and irregular heartbeat.  Final diagnosis: stop taking Focalin.  As much as I loved the behavior and focus improvements he had from the drug, I love him more and can&#039;t risk damaging his heart.""",1
Xanax,Anxiety,"""Let&#039;s be honest guys if you have anxiety you know too well it&#039;s the only thing that helps. I&#039;ve tried several others medications for my anxiety but non of them worked so well as xanax. I&#039;ve tried Paxil Amitriptyline Zyprexa Celexa Seroquel. All of them were a waste of time. The only problem with xanax is that it is addictive and becomes really easily habit forming because it WORKS!""",7
Diclofenac,Pain,"""amazing stuff for joints and muscles alike.
after two surgeries, I use it along with pain meds for PT.
I use it in place of advil, aspirin or ibuprofin as an anti-inflammatory.  it&#039;s not just for your joints!  use it on muscle pain too, but remember it&#039;s real medicine so you need to pay attention to the bead measuring stick that&#039;s in the box.  less is more, so use it sparingly at first so you can add more if you need it.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking phentermine 37.5mg October 18, 2017 once a day. I initially weighed in at 211lb on the date I started taking the medication. As of today November 18, 2017 I have lost 20lbs. I am down to 190lbs!!! I have completely changed my eating habits to no red meats, fried foods, starches, and I try to keep my calorie count right at 1425 per day which was difficult at first but now its much easier. I don&#039;t drink soda of coffee anymore but I&#039;m super thirsty all the time. The first weekend I took the medication it made me very jittery and I suffered from insomnia and horrible headaches. After the first four days of being on the medication my symptoms improved and eventually went away. I would recommend starting this medication on a weekend.""",3
Adderall,ADHD,"""Hello I&#039;m 42 years old. I always had trouble in school I quit at the end of ninth grade. Always had problems at work people always saw me as different. Never stayed at them for 2 years. I had also tried to go back to school and took GED test twice never passed the whole thing. Then I started a new job. I loved the work but my boss called me in to a room to talk to me. Said I was too passive. I fell apart could no longer do anything. My husband took me to my doctor. He tried different things, they did not work so then he put me on Adderall 20mg a day. He also put me on Zoloft 100mg at bedtime and he put me on Xanax. Saw improvement first day.

I&#039;m getting ready to start on the next dosage 11.25/69mg hoping that will speed things up a bit.  This last month has been really slow.  The cost is just prohibitive. I can only afford another month or so then will have to try and maintain/lose on my own, which I&#039;ve clearly not been been successful doing.  I&#039;ve not had any side effects and would continue this medicine as long as it worked if I could afford it.""",2
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""Taking 50mg. This is my first week. Wellbutrin gave me hives and Lexapro was nothing more than a sugar pill. My most noticeable side effects:  repetitive yawning on day three and day six. Almost incomplete non satisfactory yawning followed with a quick wave of nausea. My first two days I felt really nervous. Insides were shaky. Very minor headaches almost every other day. My general sense of well being has improved but I am quieter. I am not as vocal as I was. Almost subdued, which means less arguing with my fiance. I haven&#039;t noticed an appetite decrease, in fact my hunger pains seem more pronounced. My sex drive was gone to begin with so nothing to report there.  I was in the sun today, noticed a much greater sensitivity to it. Dry mouth.""",5
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""My insurance co would not fill a rx for oxycontin until I have tried opana &amp; a couple of others I&#039;ve never heard of. I was in a near fatal auto accident younger, I need a knee &amp; hip replacement, breast cancer at end of 2013 &amp; have had terrible time with infections, causing more surgeries.  I lay in bed usually 16 hrs a day (including sleep) because I hurt all over &amp; even more w/ house or yard chores . I&#039;m allergic to morphine, codeine, delaudid, Fentanyl, CT scan dye - I can take only Demerol after surgery. At home the only med that I am not allergic to is oxycontin &amp; ultram. I am now trying opana, because of my insurance company.  I&#039;m supposed to take 1 -20mg 2x/day. I am very disappointed. What little relief in gave me was only for about 2 hrs.""",9
Effexor,Depression,"""This med worked okay for me but then I get used to it and I have to increase it. I personally think that my body builds up a tolerance to it. If I take these meds late I get terrible night sweats. Coming off these meds was terrible. A GP advised me to go &#039;cold turkey&#039; and I had nausea, vomiting, so much crying, felt hot and cold and dizziness. I also had some really bizarre dreams when coming off these meds. This med along with Cymbalta is hard to come off of.""",5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""2 years ago I started not to sleep until mornings and my doctor gave me this medicine. It&#039;s supposed to initiate sleeping which I needed most and it was only for 2 weeks. After taking this pill my sleeping was awesome.. but after 2 weeks when I stopped it started again and I was awake all night. I couldn&#039;t sleep without pill and now its been 2 years. It helps me to sleep but bad that I can&#039;t live without it. """,0
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Hello, I started Contrave exactly 4 weeks ago; I&#039;ve lost 9 lbs. I&#039;ve been running &amp; speed walking 4.5 miles a day. Earlier I nearly passed out running and realized I had to exercise prior to taking my morning dose. Back pain this week, so two days off from running &amp; got acupuncture. Headaches were severe the 2nd and 3rd weeks, not anymore.  Difficulty urinating, &amp; waking up to pee twice a night started in week 2 and still persists, though not as severe now. I still think about food more than I wish, but I&#039;m able to cook &amp; bake w/o tasting the food. Oranges and yogurt are satisfying when I&#039;m struggling. Magnesium oxide is a must for constipation. I&#039;m happy, &amp; 13 lbs to reach goal.""",3
Trazodone,Depression,"""I have had trouble sleeping since I was 18 years old. I was ignored by my doctor. 32 years later when I started going to a new doctor that would listen to me she put me on 50mg trazadone. My life is so much better. I can get to sleep and stay asleep. There are no more disruptive repetitive thoughts and waking up screaming. I have been on it 4 years now and have no intention of going off of it. I suspect maybe a slight weight gain, but I am not absolutely sure it is the medicine causing it.""",5
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Stay away from this drug! Or at least if you have had my experience. My side effects was that I had very painful armpit boils. Never before in my life had I had them. I researched signs and symptoms online, and found Lexapro could cause them. I stopped taking Lexapro, and haven&#039;t experienced anymore. I would get one or two boils a week. They left ugly, permanent scars. Although, I&#039;ve found possible laser treatment may remove scars.""",7
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on tons of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications throughout the years.  When I started taking Effexor XR, I was thrilled- I felt so much better... minus all of the side effects.  The side effects are just awful.  I sweat constantly, I have awful headaches, no sex drive, and I gained 15 pounds.  And now the medication has stopped working sort of... I don&#039;t feel sad or happy... I just kind of feel here.  I&#039;ve tried to get off of Effexor but I get those brain zaps/vertigo feelings and vomit so I stop and keep taking it.  I guess it helps some people but if I can ever get off of it, I will be going back to another medication.""",5
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""At first amitriptyline helped me sleep and for the first two nights I slept thoroughly. Now I&#039;m having the opposite effect and it gives me insomnia as most SSRI&#039;s do. Now if I take even 10 mg it is almost impossible to sleep that night and difficult to sleep for the next 3 days. It&#039;s been 3 or 4 days since I&#039;ve taken it and I still feel like it&#039;s interfering with my sleep. If you&#039;re sensitive to SSRI&#039;s do not take this for insomnia.""",0
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve read almost every comment on this medicine. How can anyone eat while taking this medication? The smell or even looking at food makes me want to die. I started this medication back in June 2017, I&#039;ve lost 20lbs, although I&#039;m on and off. The nausea is ridiculous. I can&#039;t even drink water when taking this medicine. I puke everything up. I can not increase my dose from 1.2mg, I tried and the nausea was intolerable. Even at 1.2mg 
I feel sick. I purchased the medicine went to see my doctor told her I paid for it and she gave me five additional pens. My goal is to get down to 150lb, I&#039;m hoping that the nausea will go away. So far it has not.""",2
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""I would give this medicine 20 stars if I could. Finally a time release version of hydrocodone without any acetaminophen. I have been taking Norco 10/325 for a little over a year and it was starting to have little to no effect for my chronic back pain. I was always in constant fear about getting jumped up to oxycodone due to the Norcos not working anymore but then Zohydro comes along and changes the game! No side effects whatsoever for me and I&#039;m getting a good 12 hrs of pain relief per dose! Another positive note is that I&#039;m only taking 2 pills per day rather than taking 4-5 Norcos, and with the absence of acetaminophen I don&#039;t have to worry about damage to my liver anymore. THANK YOU ZO-HYDRO!""",9
Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""Iv had an awful  year with my cycle . Last October  i got the depo (the injection) was due to get my 2nd one in January. But i passed because  from the end of November 2015 until April 2016 i had constant bleeding every day from 9-1 and 4-8 . It finally stopped and i went may june and july with no period  it was great but then i got them back the end of July and the pain was unbearable went on for 2 weeks i rang my doc explained everything and she has put me on the patch . So far i love it this is only my 3rd week so still early days but my cycle is starting  to return to normal  the only side effect im having is im very low on energy but nothing  a berocca or two wont cure """,8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Started phentermine January 15, so almost 2 months ago. I&#039;m 5&#039;2 and my starting weight was 151lbs. I&#039;m now down to 126lbs! Lost weight really fast during the first month (about 20 pounds). Weight loss slowed during the second month but I wasn&#039;t eating quite as healthy as the first month. I&#039;m trying to lose 10 more pounds, so we&#039;ll see how it goes! I have a little over 2 weeks of phentermine left, so hopefully it will help me.""",3
Focalin,ADHD,"""My 7.5 year old son has been taking 10mg Focalin for nearly a year.  Immediately it was a &quot;miracle&quot; for us.  He had good behavior marks in school, could finish his work and we were getting along better at home too.  About a month ago it seemed like maybe he had outgrown his dose, we upped it to 15mg.  Immediately again, great results.  But, we spent 4 hours in the ER tonight getting 2 EKGs &amp; xrays because of his chest pains and irregular heartbeat.  Final diagnosis: stop taking Focalin.  As much as I loved the behavior and focus improvements he had from the drug, I love him more and can&#039;t risk damaging his heart.""",1
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""this was a terrible drug for me. I can&#039;t tell you any physical side affect because I stopped taking it immediately after a week. This drug made me scared to go to work. Every time I get ready for work this incredible fear about going to work would possess me. I would call my job and tell them am sick when I was actually afraid. I would have my aunt call my job for me to call out because I was afraid. I would try to bring courage to go to work but the closer I was to work the worse the fear would be. I called out 4 times in a row. I almost got fired. when I stopped taking it, it all went away.""",6
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;d rather weigh 1000 lbs than to take another one of these pills.  Was prescribed this by a PA who thought it was better that addipex.  I didn&#039;t even take the full dose.  Within 30 mins after taking just 1 pill I was deathly sick.  I couldn&#039;t even hold my head up.  Dizzy, headache, nauseated, throwing up, can&#039;t breathe.  feeling like  death it was so bad.  Nothing is worth feeling this bad.  1 is the lowest rating it would allow.  But my rating is a NEGATIVE 1000""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I have been off of my Vyvanse for 5 months now in a trade with my physician to help lose weight. I started out at 260. Each month my doctor would come up with an excuse to not put me on Phentermine. The other day she mentioned how this could not be taken along side with Vyvanse. I reminded her that I gave that up months ago in order to get something for weight loss. I have back injuries, require right hip replacement and double knee replacement. They said I was not a candidate for any replacements due to my weight, the weight I gained waiting for Phentermine. Now I weigh 319 and can barely get around. Thanks Doc!!! I pray this helps me!""",2
Qsymia,Obesity,"""Started taking the starter dose on April 27, 2015, then went up to the regular dose on May 11th, 3 days ago.  Didn&#039;t lose much the first week then, wow, started dropping the pounds.  It has been about 17 days and I&#039;m down 14 pounds from 264.5 to 250.5 this morning, but most of that has been in the past two weeks.  A little tingling in the feet but that is about it.  Carefully monitoring my resting heart rate with a digital reader and it has gone down, not up.  Not hungry AT ALL.  This stuff is the miracle I have been waiting for. I didn&#039;t think something like this was possible.""",2
Gabapentin,Pain,"""Severe diabetic neuropathy in hands and feet.  Severe nerve damage in the fingers of my right hand.
Lower back pain with spinal stenosis.
Started on Gabapentin 4 months ago after hand surgery.  300mg taking 3 capsules 3xday for a total of 2700mg per day.  No side effects whatsoever and no reaction being used with all of my other meds.  I find the drug to be effective for severe pain, not only for neurological pain but for musculoskeletal  pain as well.  I was able to get stop using narcotic for pain which was truly an asset.""",9
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I have been on the medication for a month now and today I go Dr. To see my weight loss.I sometimes forget I have not eaten so I make myself eat and drink plenty of water sometimes I&#039;m eating 1 time per day. Also I noticed because I love fried chicken I would only eat it once a week but I can no longer eat the chicken  - it makes me sick. This pill has helped me in so many ways. I&#039;m thankful to God and the Doctor. I need to loose this weight for health issue and I&#039;m going to be a grandma so I need to be here. I will let you all know how much I lost.""",2
Pristiq,Depression,"""I had been on Lexapro for over a year and it was working great with the exception of having zero libido. With my relationship at stake I decided to try Pristiq. After about a week I realized that I was back to my old irritable, pre-medicated self. I have been crying at the drop of a hat, snapping on loved ones, and I have been nauseous almost everyday. Not to mention I went from 125 pounds to 137 pounds in a month. I talked to my doctor today and she suggested trying Viibryd.""",5
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""My Doctor asked if I was interested in trying Qsymia to help jump start weightloss after I had my son. I have hypothyroidism so losing weight is never easy so I thought &quot;why not&quot;. I did lose about 30lbs fairly quickly but thats when it went downhill. It stopped working so she raised the dosage...well, let me tell you...MIGRAINES every night. I didnt have any other side effects but they were so bad, it wasn&#039;t worth it. THEN when I stopped I got them again! Anything thats messing with my brain scares me. I toughed it out and the migraines stopped but I am slowly gaining the weight back without any diet change at all whatsoever. I went to my endocrinologist and he said to expect weight gain automatically if you stop taking a weightless drug.""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I was in a bad car accident about a year ago and now have 15 pieces of implanted metal in my right leg.  Because of the strain to my body, my doctors encouraged me to lose weight.  I was going to the gym, staying under 1400 calories and going to physical therapy. I didn&#039;t drop a single pound.

I&#039;ve been on the phentermine for 2 and a half months, and I&#039;ve already lost an AMAZING 60 pounds...40 more, and I&#039;ll be where I was supposed to be. I just got my refill and can&#039;t wait to see what happens in the next 3 months.""",3
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I only give it two stars because it did relieve some depression while I was on it.  After being on it for about 2 months, I realized that I wasn&#039;t feeling like myself at all.  I felt like I was losing my personality and ambition.  So I decided to taper off, and my doctor had me decrease 37.5 mg per week until I was off the med.  During the tapering I didn&#039;t notice anything major side-effect-wise, but the second day I was completely off of it, everything kicked in.  I felt like I was going to die, with major brain zaps and horrible migraines being consistent for a week. I also gained 15 pounds in what seemed like a few days.  It&#039;s now been a month since I&#039;ve been off of this awful drug, and I still have brain zaps, and the weight gain too.""",5
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I was on this birth control for roughly 2 years and after hoping it would get better, I decided to try a new pill. It made me very irritated out of nowhere sometimes, would make me very emotional around my MS and made me have absolutely NO sex drive. When I did have sex, it was extremely painful and unpleasant(it was not like this at all before).  I also started having face/back acne right after starting the pill. The only reason I give it a 3/10 is because of 2 years of use, it prevented pregnancy and I had very light periods.""",8
Meperidine,Pain,"""I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s me or what but I was given Demerol (along with Vistaril and Vicodin) after my ankle surgery and it hasn&#039;t helped at all. I was admitted to the hospital twice where I received Dilaudid. That did the trick. I had a screw removed from my ankle, which had shattered and the doctor drilled through my fibula bone. After I was released, I was given Vicodin to be taken one hour after my Demerol and Vistaril. That seemed to work. I was surprised that the Demerol needed a &quot;kick&quot; so to speak. I would definitely ask my doctor for something more again if I ever had to go back on it.""",9
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am a 43 yo mom of 2 (3 if you count my husband). I can&#039;t stress enough how much Vyvanse has completely changed my life. I was diagnosed with ADD after my oldest received her diagnosis about 10 yrs ago. I&#039;ve tried Adderall, Concerta, &amp; the like and even on high doses, NEVER experienced the clarity &amp; energy I&#039;ve gotten on just 20mg of Vyvanse. I&#039;ve just started taking it 2 weeks ago &amp; wish I had discovered this medicine years ago! The only issue is that this week I titrated up to 30mg and have noticed some irritability, so I think I&#039;ll go back to the lower dose.  Love, love, LOVE my new lease on life thanks to Vyvanse!""",1
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""Opana ER is the 1st ER medication that I&#039;ve tried that actually works for an extended period of time. And I&#039;ve had to try many for my severe back and neck injuries. One 20mg pill will last at least 8 hrs, and I work long 16 hr days so that&#039;s a very good thing. I highly recommend it for people with severe problems/injuries. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend it for just mild to moderate pain problems or acute problems. Most ideal for people with chronic severe injuries who also work a lot.""",9
Trintellix,Depression,"""Was on Brintellix 5 mg for two months. Had some improvement and the side effects weren&#039;t too bad but included nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, jittery feelings and loss of libido. Bumped it up to 10 mg at the advice of my Doctor and again had more improvement but the side effects increased and the hives started. At first I didn&#039;t realize it was the medication, though I had read the precautions. My memory and focus seemed better overall. After 4 months of the 10 mg I noticed a personality change. I became lazy, had no motivation and procrastinated important tasks. This was completely out of character for me. As time went on this got worse. Plus the cost was outrageous!!!

I have been off of the Brintellix for two weeks now and am improving.""",5
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My ASD  son was put on Tenex in kindergarten for aggression/rages. It lessened the behavior problems, but came at a big price. Gained 12 lbs within the first month, terrible tummy aches for a couple hours after every dose, night terrors most nights, lost all desire for any kind of physically active play. But kept him on it for 1 1/2 years because I had found nothing else that helped the violent behaviors. After 1 1/2 years the Tenex stopped working, even at a higher dose.  Slowly weaned him off of it 2 months ago. Ever since he he has been out of control, bouncing off the walls non-stop. I&#039;m sorry I ever left him on it in the first place. His psychiatrist confessed this happens to many of his patients who have taken it for a long time.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Just started taking Vyvanse. Before I was taking Adderall 30mg XR and I&#039;ll tell you Vyvanse works so much better. Vyvanse stays active until it wears off. The only bad part is, sometimes it will stop working for like 5 minutes and then it will start working wonders again. It helps me get my work done and it helps me stay in control and very focused all day long while I&#039;m working. Before I started taking Vyvanse I couldn&#039;t concentrate what so ever. And I would never get my work done. It also makes me feel the best that I have ever felt in my whole life. If it wasn&#039;t for Vyvanse I would probably be fired. I&#039;m 24 and I finally get to enjoy life. To the people who made Vyvanse god bless you.""",1
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Week 5 - I have reached the maximum 3.0 on the injection pen. This is what I have to say about week 5: &quot;so this is what it feels like not to be hungry, always totally obsessed with food and when and what I will be eating next!&quot; Woo Ho! I have had the best week! Been able to eat healthy meals, not pig out, stop when I&#039;m full and feel normal. I have lost about 10 kgs in 5 weeks. I am not exercising - just always busy and active. 
For fatigue and energy I take a multi, vitamin C, iron and Berroca when I need it for a boost. I will be getting a prescription to continue with this injection for another month and keep monitoring progress.""",2
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I began taking this medication in September 2014. I used it for 6 months and lost 50 pounds. I had a few side effects such as constipation and loss of sleep, but both were very manageable. This medication reduced my appetite so much that at times I had to force myself to eat just to make sure I was taking in at least 1000 calories a day as directed by my doctor. I went off the medication and gained about 10 pounds back, so now I am restarting the medicine after being off a while. It&#039;s no miracle drug, but it is a great tool.""",2
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda August 2017 and in 3.5 months have lost 33lbs. My doctor and I are very happy with the results. Started at 202lbs and now am 169lb. I was very anxious to start Saxenda but I am glad I did. I do feel nauseous often, but it is worth it. I also exercise 2x/week. I have more energy and it feels better to work out/move because I am not carry as much weight around. Good luck to everyone- I hope to keep on loosing!""",2
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Seroquel makes me feel like I&#039;m on a level playing field again.  I don&#039;t feel like my thinking&#039;s distorted and I don&#039;t cry uncontrollably like I have all of my life.  I have gained weight but I&#039;m fixing to start taking Topamax to counteract that.  If the Topamax doesn&#039;t work I will still continue to take Seroquel.

Rozerem,Insomnia,"""While Rozerem is effective for getting and staying asleep, I am spaced out the next day with a strange feeling that, even though my body has had a good night rest, I still want to go take a nap at periods through the day - not a normal tiredness, but a drug induced grogginess that comes on suddenly.  Also, hard to focus my attention the next day.  I went on this because Ambien gave me short term memory loss though I had no grogginess the next day on Ambien.  The best result for me is to just sleep naturally with whatever hours I can get.""",0
Propoxyphene,Pain,"""I was so happy to re-discover Darvon.  I had taken it 30 years earlier for severe menstrual cramps when I was in high school and it worked great.

I re-discovered it because I have a terrible reaction to adhesives used with tooth-crowning.  Lortab and various other current drugs, did not work, but the oldie but goodie Darvon did.

I now use it for general pain associated with MS and it works like a charm.

BONUS - It&#039;s much cheaper than the newer, highly addictive pain killers.""",9

But my doctor said 3 months is the limit. He suggest I try Belviq since you can remind on Belviq longer. I am 5&#039;10&#039; and current weight is 251 lbs. My goal is too get down to 190 lbs and I am very optimistic in reaching this goal.""",2
Vilazodone,Depression,"""Viibryd is the only anti-depressant that really worked for me. I tried Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor. I&#039;ll never know if those 3 medicines didn&#039;t work but the effect was subtle at best. Viibryd&#039;s impact was unambiguous. So much so that after the 3rd week I felt that 30 mg would be sufficient. My Doctor advised me to go ahead and take 40 mg and that is my current dosage. Note that I was diagnosed with co-occurring anxiety and the action of Viibryd is such that it is a very effective anti-anxiety medication, at least for me. Note that some people report an increase in anxiety with Viibryd at higher dosages.""",5
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Positive: I had this for about 2 years now. I&#039;m not pregnant! My periods are lighter. I don&#039;t have to remember to take pills everyday, sometimes I forget it&#039;s in my arm. Did not hurt when it was first inserted and it took like 5 mins. Left a minor bruise but went away in no time.
Negative: Although my periods are lighter they are also longer and I hate it. Last about 2 weeks, sometimes over. Hair got thinner since I&#039;ve had this and it is beyond difficult to lose weight. I&#039;m was one of the slum girls who could eat whatever and never gain weight.

I first started off on 0.6 then in 30 days I went to 3.0 mg it definitely suppress your hunger and best of all for the first time, My A1C went for 6.3 to 5.8. This was very drastic for me because I have been over 6.0 for 10 yrs... Saxenda is a great medicine,,I think I reached a plateau because I have not lost any weight in the past 3 weeks,but the flip side, I haven&#039;t gained any extra weight either. so I am just waiting for another 3 months to check my A1C levels again,hopefully I will start losing again.....

It diminished my appetite, easy to avoid sweets.  Lost only 2lbs following 2 wks, and remained the same the following 2 wks.  It affected my already poor sleep, &amp; having more severe headaches, dry mouth &amp; light sensitivity.

Pristiq,Depression,"""Originally I would have given this drug 10/10. I had anxiety so bad that at one point I could not even leave the house without having a panic attack. On Pristiq, from my experience, a few wonderful things will happen: 1. You couldn&#039;t have a panic attack if you tried to talk yourself into it.  2. You will not gain weight (I lost weight originally and then went back to normal after 6 months). 3. Your depression will subside - though there is a BUT with that. The not great: 1. It is really hard to get off of, brain zaps, no step down options. 2. You become a bit zombie-like, lost creativity etc. A lot of not caring so much. 3. Sexual side-effects, though they do improve over time. Solid 5/10""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""First i want to say that everyone is different and not everyone reacts the same to medication. 
I started with Concerta, it didn&#039;t work for me at all. I didn&#039;t feel like myself, it took over my personality and I started to have heavy anxiety, panic attacks, anti social and paranoia.

Then I got Vyvance and its life changing, It doesn&#039;t feel like I&#039;m on a prescription. It&#039;s more a tool that helps me get through everyday life. I&#039;m much calmer, I can concentrate on one thing at the time. I get so much more done and I feel like I&#039;m in peace with my mind. My patience has improved, I&#039;m less impulsive and I can sit for a long time straight without feeling bubbly or restless.

At the begining of the 2nd week - headaches gone but now have mild body aches...still wtih dry mouth but lost the initial weight plus 2 pounds!!  I do not feel hungery at all...but it took about a week for it to kick in.  The cost is prohibitive...I will not re-order. Even with Insurance I can not afford $200.00 out-of-pocket. It DOES NOT give you energy like Phentermine....just makes you feel full.  Oh, also, very constipationg!!!!!  I will finish the bottle - it is working for me. You have to be a &quot;responder&quot; to this medication and only 50% of people are ( I didn&#039;t know that) see if you can get the first 15 days free""",3
Viibryd,Depression,"""I couldn&#039;t stop crying and this medicine made me stop.
When it starts to wear off I know because I feel the tears coming back. I only take 5mg a day but have to increase at weeks end due to being tired so I increase to 7.5mg (break the pill) then go back to 5 mg on Monday.  It works for me.  Only negative is a small craving for cigarettes.  My Doc gave it to me for free.  Hope insurance covers it.""",5
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""Horrible!!!!!!!! I tried 10mg for 2 days over the weekend and stayed awake they most if it I took it 39 minutes before bedtime as directed 7:30pm and 11:00pm I was wide awake I am so upset I had to purchase over the counter unisom to get a nights rest on Sunday in fear of starting the work week dead tired since I didn&#039;t get any rest this weekend now I have to go back to my doctor and see what he suggests I had to get prior authorizations to get approval from my insurance company for this waste of time extremely disappointed DO NOT waste your or your doctors time read the other reviews most DO NOT have good experiences with this medication your better costly and sleep with generic Ambein""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""I had such high hopes for this to help me control my cravings etc.  I did lots of research and talked at length with my doctor about side effects (lingering minor headaches, nausea).  Took one pill in the AM Saturday, had marked dizziness, nausea, and headache (borderline migraine).  Made it through the day.  Took one pill in the AM Sunday, and about two hours later it triggered the worst migraine I have ever had.  It was excruciating! The next day (Monday) I didn&#039;t take any, and went to Urgent Care, where I was ran fluids and given meds for migraine pain and nausea.  It&#039;s now Thursday of the same week, four days off the meds and I&#039;m finally beginning to feel normal.  While Contrave may work for some, it will absolutely not work for me.""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got this for the same reason as everyone else, because I hate taking the pill. I must say I give it a 10 for birth control considering I&#039;m constantly on my period, so I can&#039;t have sex anyway. It&#039;s been three months that I&#039;ve been on my period, and the constant bleeding caused a bacterial infection which then led to problems with UTIs. I am miserable, but my doctor made me sign an agreement saying I couldn&#039;t get it removed because of period problems, so now I&#039;m stuck. I would not suggest this product to anyone who plans on having sex in the next six months or doesn&#039;t want to pay to constantly buy pads or tampons. It is becoming expensive and not worth all of this hassle.""",8
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I had Implanon inserted May of 2012. Once it was inserted, I continued to have a period for 6 months non-stop, which caused some other issues. Once that stopped, I had periods for two weeks, and then would be off for two weeks, and then back on. This went on for a year. Now they come and go as they please. One thing that I&#039;ve had a hard time dealing with though is the weight gain. I gained 10 lbs in just one year, and during this second year I have gained 5 more lbs. I have never in my life had an issue with weight (gaining or losing), but this has been it for me. It has also given me extremely painful periods. It HAS done it&#039;s job in preventing pregnancy though! Which I am pleased with!""",8
Diphenhydramine,Insomnia,"""I usually work a 10 hr shift in the afternoon but my boss has changed my Saturday shift to 5am-1pm. We live on a farm and have 3 outside dogs that like to bark at night.  The first morning shift I only got 2 hrs sleep because of our dogs. I purchased Zzquill to get some help falling asleep the night before my morning shifts. I took the recommended dose (2pills) at 8pm. I went to bed at 8:30. I didn&#039;t feel any effect from the medication until almost 10:30!! And then I woke up again at 12:30am! I do not recommend Zzquill if you want to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep.""",0
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I started Effexor after the birth of my first child due to post-partum depression. I have never been severely depressed prior to this. My doctor first prescribed Zoloft which did not help at all. After two weeks, I was put on Effexor and started feeling better within a few days. The only side effect that I ever noticed was having no sex drive at all. I stopped taking it after a year (I tapered so I did not notice any withdrawal symptoms everyone talks about) and was recently put back on it due to some family issues pushing me back into a depression. The first few days are rough but I&#039;ve been on it for a week now and I do feel a difference. My anxiety and mood has improved and I can actually function. This medicine works great for me.""",5
Imipramine,Pain,"""Taking at a very low dose to help me sleep as I have fibromyalgia related to arthritis.  I tried two other drugs before this one and both have me extremely bad nightmares.  I have found that I don&#039;t get nightmares with this one.  Within an hour of taking, I am solid asleep virtually all night.  I don&#039;t get foggy the next day.  I really haven&#039;t had any side effects except for a slightly dry mouth, but I am on 10mg.""",9
Vraylar,Bipolar Disorde,"""Have had a great experience with vraylar. Went from oversleeping on a regular basis (on risperidone) to sleeping a healthy 8-10 hours. Feel sharper, more social, and generally in a better mood. Unfortunately have been dealing with insomnia and on and off nausea. It&#039;s been two weeks since starting. Overall the positives outweigh the negatives and I&#039;m hoping the side effects subside over time. Give it a shot.""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve only used it one night so far (over the fears of having sleep apnea, and waking when I can&#039;t breathe, a pill to keep me asleep just kind of scared me but walking around sleepier and sleepier each day, I caved.  True benefits I don&#039;t know yet, but I do know last night was the first night I slept over 8 hours STRAIGHT.  My Machine says I still had my sleep apnea events, but they seem about the same as normal.""",0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Hi Ladies,

I just got my Skyla inserted today by my gyno. I was so nervous reading the reviews of how everyone (almost everyone) had a negative experience with the insertion process. 

To be prepared for the pain...I took 800mg of Ibuprofen and 1000mg of Tylenol 40 mintues before my procedure. I asked my doctor if was going to hurt and she said &quot;Yes, you are in a doctors office&quot; to break the ice.

The only painful part was when they had to open my vaginia up for the spectrum which always hurt when I get my annual Pap smear then the pain goes away. After that my dr explained the process what she was doing and ask me if this hurt and I was like no, was it suppose to??? She was like that&#039;s great then and we had a pleasant conversation.""",8
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I have tried many anti-depressents over the years and couldn&#039;t handle any of them as I would feel so drugged and sleepy on them I can&#039;t do anything but this time my doctor told me about Brintellix, and he gave me a lot of samples.    He said it&#039;s a new antidepressant that doesn&#039;t have side effects.  I was majorly depressed.  I was crying everyday and even left my 30 year marriage.  Well I was on 10mg and from the first week it was great.  I was calmer, stopped crying, and I felt really happy.  I love it!  Only thing is this stuff is so great, it is $400 &amp; with my insurance the co-pay was $70 &amp; I even had a coupon!  I can&#039;t afford that every month so I had to stop. Now I&#039;m getting very depressed again after 1 week without.  Can anyone help?""",5
Adoxa,Acne,"""Adoxa worked quite well in conjunction with being on Yaz (which makes the Yaz useless as actual birth control). It really cleared up my life long battle of break outs. However there were some side effects that went along with the long term use of the antibiotic as strong a doxycycline, like the nausea, vomiting. It was well worth it. I never had a break out while I was on it for 6 months. After my treatment was completed, the Yaz help with the maintenance for awhile.  Every once and in a while I get a small pimple. Nothing compared to the big icky ones I used to get.""",4
Adapalene,Acne,"""I had been taking oral contraceptive for about 6 years and using proactive; my acne was under control. About 1 year ago, I stopped taking the pill and my skin went absolutely crazy! I had horrible acne.. It was awful. I spent so much $ on OTC creams and washes with no improvement. Finally, I went to the dermatologist and she prescribed a 60 day oral antibiotic, adapelene 2% gel applied once daily, and cleanse with only cetephil. I used this combo as directed for about 2 months with a small amount of improvement. This is the routine that ended up giving me the best skin I&#039;ve ever had: no antibiotic, adapelene 2x per day, cetephil make-up remover cloths, cetephil cleanser, benzoyl peroxide as spot treatment. Life is good!""",4
Accutane,Acne,"""Accutane is working wonders for me. I am an 18 year old male who was skeptical at first because I had literally tried everything to clear up my cystic acne I had on my back and chest. I am now 1 month into my 5 month course and am already seeing a huge improvement. Other then the dry lips, I have no other side effects. Some people say accutane makes them depressed and suicidal, but accutane has actually made me more happy and more energetic then I was. I feel so much more confident about my skin now then I ever have. It&#039;s summer, and now I am never wearing a shirt because accutane has made me more confident. Strongly recommend this drug, as it has worked wonders for me so far.""",4
Tramadol,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Tramadol HCL for severe anxiety and clinically severe OCD. This medicine really works wonders for anxiety and my Psychiatrist has me on this combining it with Risperdal and Xanax XR and Xanax IR. But, before I combined Tramadol HCL with those other medicines I was taking the Tramadol HCL alone and it knocked my anxiety down to more tolerable levels and helped me ignore my obsessions from my OCD more.""",7
Ultram,Pain,"""I have arthritis in most joints and back and neck pain.  I have used Tramadol for 2 years now. It was life changing in the way it relieved pain without nasty side effects of  hydrocodone (I got very irritable when it wore off). Seems to be taking higher dosage for less relief but still would rather continue the tramadol and use something for breakthrough pain on physical work days. If you experience nausea try a lower dose and work up to more. Stick with it,  the nausea went away for me. When I forget a day or so and go back to it I sometimes get nausea again.""",9
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I live in the UK where it is virtually impossible to get Xanax (or any benzodiazepine) so I am very lucky to have found a good doctor to prescribe it. I am 25 years old and the last 14 years of my life were a living hell. I have BPD and a very severe anxiety disorder that left me having multiple daily panic attacks, breakdowns and even suicide attempts. Every doctor told me in the UK we get talking therapy and an SSRI for anxiety, but never benzo&#039;s. So I suffered on for years and years until 4 months ago I found a Dr who prescribed me Xanax (Alprazolam) 0.5mg 3 times a day (1mg if needed) and it is a miracle drug to me. For the first time in my life, I live without the constant, crippling anxiety. I HIGHLY recommend this med.""",7
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal gave me two ulcers, failed a drug screen for one of the best jobs around (said I had PCP in my system), debilitating headaches and gained an immense amount of weight. I was hospitalized for attempted suicide and my doc got mad when I weaned myself off. Having said that, I know lots of people that has had great success with it. I guess it all depends on the individual. Not all bipolar cases are the same.""",6
Effexor XR,Depression,"""Sadly only lasted 5 days on Effexor XR. The side effects from the 75mg dose was unlike anything I have experienced before. Within 10 hours of the first dose I had severe anxiety - something I had never experienced before. Within hours of second dose the extreme nausea came on. By day 3 I was pratically bed-ridden in cold sweats and feeling completely &quot;out of it&quot; . I persevered hoping the effects would begin to subside but by the 5th day I had severe nausea, couldn&#039;t get out of bed from feeling so sick, horrible tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and felt spaced out to the point that I began to wonder if I would ever feel &quot;normal&quot; again. Advised by GP to cease immediately on hearing my side effects.""",5
Orlistat,Obesity,"""The following are the scary details of my experience:

1. Headaches at the top right of my head.
2. Muscle cramps in my calves.
3. Constipation
4. Frequently wanting to urine. The output was about two tablespoons followed by severe tingling in both arms (I tolerated it for 2 days). This #4 item became scary. I came to this website, read the reviews and threw the rest of the pills in the garbage.""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""When I was a teenager I had *mild* cystic acne---mild meaning I would only get one or two cysts a month, but the ones I did get were huge, red, painful, ugly, and often left a scar.  Years later, approaching the age of 30 and having exhausted every treatment under the sun, it was not getting any better.  My dermatologist suggested Spironolactone (100mg/day)... My skin got worse for the first few weeks, almost like my body was expelling everything... but I stuck with it and it&#039;s been a MIRACLE!!  My skin is smooth and acne-free.  The only side effect is I&#039;m groggy for a few hours so I take it at night.   Don&#039;t give up on it if things get worse initially, it is a hormonal treatment and might take a while for your body to adjust.  I LOVE it!!""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I used Claravis for my first course and everything went well. The side effects that I remember were extremely chapped/dry lips, dry skin, dry hair (which I didn&#039;t have to wash for a week), joint pain, headaches.  I repeated the treatment because some acne was reappearing but nothing compared to the begining so I took a much lower dose. The second course was with Amnesteem (because it was the one available at Walgreens in that moment) and everything was going well until my liver enzymes were elevating each month and I had to stop the medicine.  When I recovered, I went back to Claravis and liver enzymes got normalized.  My doctor said that he experienced the same side effect with other patients.""",4
Bupropion,Depression,"""Taking name brand. started 150 1x a day for a week. first day so amazing, energized,went to the gym, positive &amp; for 4 days felt great.5th not so much &amp; by 7th day was feeling back to my depressed self so I upped it to 2 a day. now I go from anxious to flat. feel absolutely nothing, zoned out, very irritable.  vivid dreams &amp; nightmares, kind of can&#039;t separate  dream from reality cause it seems like someone&#039;s in the house &amp; I wake up out of a dead sleep &amp; I&#039;m not sure if someone&#039;s in the house. going to give this a few more days if things don&#039;t get worse hopefully they&#039;ll get better, if not, not going to take it anymore. I took this because I wanted to avoid weight gain which happened years ago with other SSRIs. hasn&#039;t affected appetite.""",5
Avinza,Pain,"""I found out about 3 years ago that I had systemic lupus,and it hit me like a brick wall. Besides my joints and muscles hurting, my immune system attacked my blood vessels causing my blood pressure to be uncontrollably high. The Avinza helped bring the blood pressure down as a natural side effect, and has help to manage the pain in the rest of my body. I am currently taking 120 mgs slow release daily, but still have some pain. I would not have been able to function without the morphine. Aside from the pain in general, my blood pressure was never out of the &quot;stroke and heart attack&quot; zone with regular hypertension drugs. The worse side effects are nausea and constipation.""",9
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I have been suffering from panic attack since 2013 and was kept on Xanax .5mg TDS really its the drug which can enhance the Quality of life. Even though we have the xanax regularly but some times panics and anxiety comes, i though to cure anxiety off when met to psychiatrist he prescribed Zoloft 50mg once a day along woth clonazipam .25mg at bed time, having satarted that panics came with great intensity i left both Zoloft and Revotril and rejoin Xanax the problem solver... Thx Almighty who has put lots of benefits in Xanax...""",7
Silenor,Insomnia,"""I have used all known sleepers and other off label medicines for sleepers and I have taken Silenor 6 mg for 3 nights.  It is amazing.  I fall asleep with no problems and stay asleep for 7-8 hours.  No hang over or other side effects.  I had been taking Remeron 60mg for sleep, as it was the best of all I had tried. I thought the Remeron was doing an okay job until I tried the Silenor.  I am thrilled and feel more rested then I have in years.""",0
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My 11 year old son has ADHD with anxiety disorder.  This medication has helped him manage his anxiety (he is much happier) and he is able to focus better on managing everything from time to his emotions.  He has better stamina mentally and can perform mental tasks for longer periods of time.  He is also acting more mature and being more responsible. He takes 2mg at night 1 hour before bed along with gummy melatonin to help him sleep.  He sleeps well and feels good during the day.  Overall this medication has helped him a great deal.  It&#039;s like it took him out of his anxious rut and gives him a better outlook.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I was a hard core Atkins dieter in my early 20&#039;s, lost a tremendous amount of weight, and kept it off for 5 years.  I then got pregnant, stopped eating healthy and gained everything back and then some.  Now I&#039;m in my 30&#039;s with my highest weight being 218.  I started back on the Atkins and started exercising but my weight was not coming off like it did when I was in my 20&#039;s.  My doctor prescribed phentermine and I&#039;ve lost a pound every day, I&#039;m finally out of the 200&#039;s and down to 198 today (never thought I&#039;d see the day).  I have had dry mouth occasionally  with no other side effect.  I&#039;ve been exercising and eating low carb and feel great.  I hope to be 135 someday.""",3
Lexapro,Depression,"""I have been on Lexapro for over 4 yrs after going into a deep depression after several traumatic life experiences. I am very grateful for Lexapro and my therapist (who helps me with coping techniques.) After being on Lexapro my family has told me they are not sure how to take the new me. When I was upset I would have anxiety attacks and black out. When I was angry I was uncontrollable sometimes even physical with my love ones. The sad part is I did not even know they were happening or happened until they told me. I wish I had gotten help sooner but now I am grateful and blessed for Lexapro and therapy. Every medicine is not right for everyone so you need to find the one that fits you along with therapy.""",5
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I read all posts regarding Seroquel which, for the large majority, seems to provide good measure for treatment of insomnia. I will admit that after reading the posts, I am envious. Seroquel was prescribed for me because for the last 4 months 
I have only been able to sleep 2 hours/night. The 2 hours are divided in 2 separate incriminates. I take 400 mg. (highest dose allowed) before bedtime. Most unfortunately, Seroquel has provided me NO benefit. Will talk to my physician to see if there is something else that will help not only to induce sleep, but to be able to wake up hours after sleeping, rather than 1 hour twice nightly.""",0
Bupropion,Depression,"""Been on 150 for 3 weeks. It&#039;s been up and down but overall up. I&#039;m bipolar and have rage issues so I was very worried about that but it has actually been less of an issue than with other antidepressants I&#039;ve been on (Celexa, Lexapro) and tried unsuccessfully (Cymbalta, Prozac, Latuda). Also, I tried the generic non XL a few years ago and it did throw me into a blind range. I was a little prone to &quot;upsetness&quot; like sensitivity that I would then lash out in anger, but not rage, for the first two weeks. Had some anxiety issues but those have dispersed. Otherwise, libido is normal again after Lexapro and now getting motivated to get out of bed to eat or go to work or shower is like picking up a 1 lb weight instead of  a 20 lb weight. 25yoF""",5

Does anyone have any ideas to help me?  

I am a VERY active 51 year old that has been fighting this weight it seems forever.  I keep working out harder and eating sensibly and still can&#039;t lose weight.

After 2+ wks of 0.6, I&#039;m now at 0.9, largely w/o side effects except constipation. My endocrinologist says the best weight loss is at 3.0, but at 0.9, I&#039;m absolutely seeing wt loss (6 lbs in a month) and noticing distinct lack of hunger. I&#039;m cautiously giving it a rating of 8, because it still beats amphetamine-like appetite suppressants.

Their handwriting went from sloppy to super neat, reading skills increased, grades were mostly A&#039;s...and many more great results!

Tramadol,Pain,"""More powerful than I thought... dr prescribed this to treat scoliosis pain in a &#039;non narcotic way&#039;. It helped my back pain greatly. I was also in a great mood in the beginning. I thought it was wonderful (despite a constant minor headache)!

Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""So I got Nexplanon just under a year ago. I originally got it because it was supposed to stop my period (and mine is generally on the irregular side) and because it was free with my student insurance and lasted 3 years. So my first ~2 months were terrible. I bled every day and it ranged from a regular period flow to spotting that was on the heavy side. Then for the next 6 months it was regular period timings, but they would often last longer than my previous periods had. 7-9 days instead of my usual 4-6. Now, in the last 3 months it seems to have tailed off and my period has stopped, as the product promised it would.
Now that the product is working as promised, I&#039;m extremely happy with it. It just seems to take around a year to settle.""",8
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""Well this medication has worked VERY well for my ADHD! It helps me concentrate and makes my mood overall more lifted! I Notice energy and a desire to do work and complete tasks instead of being a lazy couch potato like before. Side effects: Anxiety, Depersonlization and Derealization on this medication sometimes makes you feel like a robot! And heart rate goes up also! But it worked much better than Adderall. Adderall gave me bad anxiety and higher heart rate! Much stronger and more positive mood from Dexedrine. """,1
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had Mirena for exactly 6 days and I&#039;m still experiencing minor cramping. The spotting only lasted for a day and a half. I&#039;ve gotten used to the cramping but if it gets too annoying I just pop a Motrin. The process itself was extremely painful because I&#039;d never experienced cramps before hand. I&#039;d say the part that was painful though was the dilation of my cervix. The second day was much better. I didn&#039;t have a sex drive for the first 3 days but on the 4th day I was ready to go. My face is clearer than ever. No regrets. Results may vary guys. Make your GYN your bestie just to stay on top of things. Good luck!""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on Contrave for almost a complete month now and I love it! I started seeing pounds drop right away, going into my 3rd week and already down 11 pounds! I have been lucky enough to experience no side effects (knock on wood), and I cannot wait to keep going and see what I can accomplish. It makes you get full faster and honestly makes you turn away from junk food. I was working out 5-6 times a week with a healthy diet and still was not seeing the results I felt I should be seeing, but 3.5 weeks on Contrave and I&#039;m back in my size 8 jeans!""",2
Caziant,Birth Control,"""Let me preface this by saying I have taken many different kinds of birth control pills throughout my teen and adult years. This is by far the BEST bcp for my cystic, hormonal acne. I&#039;ve also taken Cyclessa which is in the same family (desogestrel &amp; triphasic) with the same results. Any time I went off of Caziant to &quot;switch it up&quot; was when I started breaking out horribly in cystic bumps. If you suffer from hormonal acne, definitely give Caziant a try. Other benefits are light &amp; short periods, very mild mood swings, normal sex drive, no weight gain.""",8
Dapsone,Acne,"""I&#039;m 18 and I never had bad acne when I was younger. Then when I was 16 started on birth control. My hormones went crazy and I started breaking out everywhere. I went to my dermatologists and she recommended Aczone along with using Cetaphil face wash twice a day. I started seeing results after a couple of days. It did take time to see full results. After 2 1/2 months I had beautiful clear skin, which is something I hadn&#039;t seen in a long time. I suggest you have patience with this product. I know I did and I am very pleased with the results.""",4
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""I have extreme insomnia my Dr has prescribed every Medication for Insomnia either I had bad reactions to it or didn&#039;t help at all so yesterday My Dr prescribed OTC Melatonin I took one pill 3 mg I  had a very restful 5-6 hrs~I&#039;m going to try 1/2 of a Pill to to get a full night sleep~I&#039;ll see how a 5 mg dose will work~but I was just happy that the 3mg gave me a restful few hrs. I&#039;ll report if the 1 1/2 Pills helps me stay asleep for 8 hrs. Right now I&#039;m Thankful that I actually went to sleep and had a few good hrs of rest &amp; sleep. No side effects !""",0
Paxil CR,Anxiety,"""I have health-related anxiety issues.  Ten years ago I took 25 mg Paxil CR for about a year and it was a life-saver.  No side effect, no withdrawal issues.  A month ago my anxiety returned for a new reason. My doctor started me on 20 mg citalopram. I think I had every side effect possible and made my anxiety worse.  I switched to 12.5 mg Paxil CR and within three days was a new person.  For me, there is no better medicine.""",7
Sertraline,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been suffering from manic depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. I came to my breaking point last month and finally sought professional help. I&#039;m now on day 3 with taking Zoloft 25mg twice daily and I&#039;ve noticed some difference already and it&#039;s for the better. 
I&#039;m not really experiencing the side effects everyone is talking about and I&#039;m sleeping just fine. I was a little sleepy the first day and body was a little sore but nothing like everyone is describing. I know its  only been day 3 so its not really in my system. So I&#039;ll check in in a few weeks. Wish me luck""",5
Pristiq,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on 50mg for about 3 months now. Practically no side effects to begin with and immediate relief of anxiety. A litlle too sleepy to begin with. Today I am feeling optimistic, less negative thinking and overall a lot better. With time the sexual side effects have turned stronger - I basically have very little sex drive and cannot orgasm. Occasionally I have very mild anxiety as I have stayed on 50mg despite the doctor having told me to increase the dosage. But the overall result is very positive and I will only change it if the sexual issues become too uncomfortable.""",5
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""Overweight Mom who thought that I would be that for life. My friend who was on Jenny Craig (it did not work) used this and after following her lead we are both big losers. No side effects except a little tired first week then energy went up gradually. I take my exercise serious now and instead of losing two pounds per week I am at 3.36 per week or more. Flat out works you got nothing to lose because they give you a two week trial free. After that you will be more then happy to pay for it.""",2
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I am a register nurse working 12 hour shifts.  tugging pulling.  I fell back in 1998 and damaged both of my knee&#039;s severely.  I have taken many different medications to control my chronic pain.  I have been taking nucynta 75mg every 6 hours since summer 2015.  Not all of my pain is gone, but I can tolerate more activity.  My life has improved greatly.   It is great that I do not have to burn up my liver with Tylenol.  Like all medications; it is not for everybody.  It works with my body chemistry.   My pain levels are low enough where I can sleep.""",9
Nucynta,Pain,"""Nucynta is indeed a Novel medicine. I have Scoliosis with a 31 Cobb angle and I have tried so many different medications, alternative medicine (including Chiropractors and Acupuncturists). The reason why Nucynta is great is because it takes away most of my pain and it relaxes me. It has no &quot;Euphoric Feeling&quot; which makes it good for long term use without a potential for abuse. That&#039;s why I believe that your Pain Doctor would also feel more comfortable prescribing it. I have been on it for a month now and I can tell that it works perfectly. The only problem with Nucynta is that it makes you drowsy (and for me it makes me go to sleep, so I cannot take it in the morning). """,9
Oxycodone,Pain,"""Full hip replacement. I take Oxycodone 20 mg every 6 hours,when I first started taking, it gave me headaches but my pain control was great, in about a week, the headaches were gone. I would highly recommend this pain med, I have been taking them for a month and my mind is clear, don&#039;t feel tired from a scale of 1 to 10 my pain is about a 2 or 3 with the pain meds. I would like to warn you if you wait too long out to take your meds you will regret it. I take 20 mg every six hours, one night I slept about 10 hours and woke up with intense pain.""",9
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I just started Nucynta ER I took the first dose at bedtime could not sleep the entire night, had some upset stomach, that&#039;s the bad side, I have 3 damaged disc in my neck and 3 damaged disc in my lower back, so I have a great amount of pain but from the first dose pain didn&#039;t stop completely but was greatly improved I don&#039;t know if this medication helps with anxiety but it gave me a sense of calm, didn&#039;t sleep but felt very relaxed, my cost after insurance and a coupon was only 25.00.""",9
Effexor,Depression,"""I am a 21 year old female. I was on Prozac for ten years (40 mg at the end) before switching to Effexor (37.5 mg at first, 262.5 mg now) because I was having issues with anxiety. I was ok for a while then I became extremely depressed and suicidal. My doctor increased my dose and although it did take away the misery and suicidal thoughts, I wouldn&#039;t describe myself as happy. I feel constantly tired, sleeping up to 16 hours a day. I can&#039;t work and social situations exhaust me. It took me a while to realize Effexor might be responsible for some of these symptoms. I am talking to a psychiatrist about changing my medication but I&#039;m very worried about the infamous withdrawl from Effexor.""",5
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I am a 51 yr old female 6&#039;0 tall and my weight has really ballooned in the last five years.  I started on the trial, I wanted to make sure it would work for me before I spent alot of money.  I had the headache and body aches the first two days, and I am sticking to a high protein diet as well.  I have lost 13 lbs the first two weeks!  I am pretty good at dieting but have not been able to stick to anything for a long time.  My food cravings are totally gone!  I still have an occasional headache, but that is ok I can&#039;t wait for a year to go by I really feel like this is going to work!""",3
Lithium,Depression,"""This medication, in combination with a med for sleep, alleviated me of suicidal ideation in matter of one week inpatient. On the downside, I do feel quite flat, and the effects on my health are not able to be known this early on. The poor health feelings are usually due to the drug not being eliminated fast enough by your liver.

I received minimal therapy and didn&#039;t experience life improvement, yet all bouts of suicidal depression are gone. Depression for me is now less severe, and more transient.""",5
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had nexaplon for officially a month now. The site where it was inserted has almost healed- very little bruising or discoloration. I&#039;m Black American with a mocha chocolate complexion, just to provide further details. My menstuation came a week late, I&#039;ve always had a regular cycle. I wasn&#039;t sure if it was going to come. I&#039;ve talked to my doctor who had that spotting for the first six months, which was good to know. At the time, my cycle had just ended so I wasn&#039;t sure if I would experience spotting or not. It&#039;s been almost five days since my period ended and I&#039;ve had very minimal spotting. So, so far so good!""",8
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on it for 11 days so far and I&#039;ve lost 22lbs. I started out at 301lbs and now I&#039;m 279lbs. That&#039;s just with the free starter dose. I completely cut out carbs, sweets and soda. I went for a weigh in today and my doctor almost didn&#039;t recognize me. Most people lose an average of 5-7lbs their first 2 weeks but my 2 weeks isn&#039;t up until Monday. I haven&#039;t exercised at all due to my 10-15 hour work days. I told my doctor I think I lost it this fast because I have no desire to eat. All I do is drink water. I try and force myself to eat but all I get in is a few bites of a protein bar all day. I have severe dry mouth. I&#039;m going to try the next strength up next week and see how that goes. My goal is 199lbs.""",3
Contrave,Obesity,"""This is a miracle drug.  I am on week 3,  I have lost 12 pounds.  The side effects I am experiencing are dry mouth and a little fatigue.  Let me just say that I was a depressed drunk.  I drank every day.  The medicine contains Buproprian which treats depression and aids in smoking cessation. It also contains an opiate antagonist which blocks the effects of downers like alcohol.  I have tried drinking but I either don&#039;t want it or get no effect.  I used to zoom through three tall stiff screwdrivers. Additionally I have had the same pack of cigarettes for 4 days now.  I have my life back.  I look great and my family is so pleased.  Started working from day 1.  I love it.""",2
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I was hurt on the job back in 2006.Had a disc removed and fusion of L4 and L5 in my lower back.I  have suffered for years with chronic back and leg pain because of this injury.I was on 80 mg&#039;s of Percocet  a day for 2 years and was taken off of it,cold turkey as they say,by my Dr.
After 5 days of terrible withdrawl&#039;s,my Dr. put me on OPANA ER 10 mg tab&#039;s,twice a day.They helped me with my withdrawl symptoms but didn&#039;t do much for my pain.
My Dr. agreed to up my dosage to 30 mg&#039;s,twice per day.
WOW!!!! What a difference these 30 mg pills make.Pain is about a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10 and I can finally sleep again.
It is known that only 10 percent of your dose is actually absorbed by the body and the rest is eliminated when taken orally.""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started Contrave less than 4/mo ago. I have never provided a review before but feel I should with this drug. I have lost 17/lbs so far and it has been steadily going down. I am a counselor so as a result of my job I emotionally eat quite a bit. Contrave keeps my cravings &amp; stress eating from popping up so when I do eat, it is easy to make the healthy choice. I am not jittery because it is not a stimulant. The only negatives have been constipation which I address with a stool softner. I also find that I don&#039;t consume as much alcohol which is not actually a downside unless you are trying to get drunk. Most of my office is now on this prescription and most have lost 5lbs per month. It isn&#039;t covered by our inurance but should be. Love it!""",2
Levo-Dromoran,Pain,"""A very effective pain medicine that you don&#039;t feel you have to go reaching for it all the time to get relief. I mean you can strictly adhere and take this responsibly per doctors directions. Not many pharmacies carry it, if at all so you will have to order it. That means bringing in your prescription to order it. It may take awhile but it is worth it, for severe pain. Just stick with a good oxycodone for other types of pain. This Levo-Dromoran lasts awhile and too much can cause respiratory depression.""",9
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""This has been the worst experience with birth control I&#039;ve ever had. From 2 month long periods, to having the worst acne of my life at 23, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to my worst enemy. If I could give zero stars, I would. Since the moment I&#039;ve gotten nexplanon, I&#039;ve been broken out so bad with painful, cystic acne that no miracle of skin care or diet seems to touch. Before this, I&#039;ve always taken the pill, and would occasionally get a pimple or two, but I&#039;ve never had an ongoing problem with acne until now, at 23 years old... I also get random pains in my arm where the implant is, and I have to be careful not to stretch my arm out too far, or bump it on things. I also have much worse mood swings. Now counting down the days until it&#039;s removed""",8
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started Lamictal at 25 mg and was instructed to titrate up to 100 mg.  As soon as I got to 50mg, I got the rash. I was told to go back down to 25 instead of stopping completely. 2 weeks later I had a stiff neck, sore throat, burning eyes, mouth sores, red purple rash came back worse than before.  I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. The most painful thing I&#039;ve ever been through! I am still recovering after being discharged from the hospital a week ago.""",6
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""I was first prescribed it in a psych ward as a PRN.  I take a cocktail of sedative drugs through the day and at night including: 90mg Phenobarbital, 15mg Zyprexa, 2mg Klonopin, and 200mg Vimpat all at night.  I still have had major trouble sleeping.  I got put on 10mg Sonata and the first night it didn&#039;t work.  The second night I laid down and tried to sleep on my own, after about two hours of no sleep I took the sonata and within 15 minutes I was asleep and slept all through the night till I was woke up for breakfast at 8:00 am, oh and I laid down at 9:00 pm and took the sonata at about 11:00 pm.  It works wonderfully for me but I think it has its own effects to each individual user and the meds they are on too. I love it""",0
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Consider mirtzapine if you have intractable insomnia. I&#039;m a recovering alcoholic and my sleep patterns got thoroughly screwed up during my drinking years. Mirtzapine 30 milligrams provides the most natural sleep I have ever had in my life. I sleep for eight hours and wake refreshed the way I did when I was teenager. It&#039;s so much better than benzos. Doctors may be reluctant to prescribe because of the chance of weight gain. I did gain weight because it gave me the munchies. But it levelled off at about a 7-pound gain. But it did level off!!! And you may feel completely zonked for the first two or three days. It&#039;s a good idea to start on the weekend. But again, the extreme drowsiness did disappear after a few days for me.""",0
Cymbalta,Depression,"""I started Cymbalta two months ago (60mg/day) for moderate depression and anxiety. It has been a roller coaster ride and I am now stepping off luckily. I have experienced many of the side effects after 3 weeks including blurred vision, tremors, itching, cold hands, night sweats, no appetite, no libido, horrible insomnia. 
I begun sleeping all (days) with a detached feeling and no desire to see friends or family. 
It initially helped with my depression so I was optimistic since I have never had any positive experience with any antidepressants. However, it took me into a whirlwind of nervous energy at week three, to a flat washed out two weeks ago. Two days ago I stopped cold turkey. I feel better already.""",5
Doryx,Acne,"""I am a teen who suffered from borderline mild-severe acne. My dermatologist prescribed Epiduo. Nothing over the 6 weeks. She then put me on Doryx with it. I fell in love with my skin after about a week. It dried up current problem spots and never got a breakout. However, do NOT take in calcium while on this. The medicine will bind to the calcium and will not take effect. Whenever I eat a good amount of cheese, milk, or dairy, I break out. You should experiment with your diet if this medicine does not work for you.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am a female  with hypothyroidism, post menopause and over 50.  I was at the heaviest in my life gaining over 60 lbs after being diagnosed with my thyroid disorder. I finally found a Dr. who would put me on Phentermine. I have been on it for a week short of 90 days and I&#039;ve lost 32 lbs. There&#039;s nothing that in my 7 yrs fighting this hypothyroidism that allowed me to lose even 10 lbs. Not even cutting my daily caloric intake to less than 1200 calories a day. Which my Dr. wasn&#039;t at all happy about since she says 1400-1600 is the very least someone should eat.  I am so very happy with the results. I wish of course I could have lost the entire 60lbs I gained when I got the slow thyroid issue. But I am nevertheless very pleased.""",3
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My 10 yr old daughter was put on low dose (20mg) of Vyvanse for ADHD.  Her ADHD was severely affecting her school work.  Positive:  immediately teachers and I noticed she could focus, sit more still, and initiate her own homework, etc...  But it&#039;s the NEGATIVE side affects that seriously concerned me.  She went from a cheerful, joyous girl, to a melancholy zombie.  Even worse, she became more and more depressed &amp; irritable at night.  She said she felt like she lost all personality and had a sadness that she didn&#039;t understand why.  I can not emphasize enough how scary it was to see her whole personality change, and that was not worth any benefits.she got out of Vyvanse. Other side effects:  loss of appetite, joint/muscle pain, mouth twitch.""",1
Pristiq,Anxiety,"""I have suffered terribly from social anxiety for the past 4 years. I am 23 years old, and once it started negatively affecting my performance at my first job out of college, I felt it necessary to do something. Was on Zoloft for a few months prior, but it suddenly stopped working. I was put on 50mg of Pristiq and I felt it working IMMEDIATELY. Right after I took the first pill I went into a foggy state, but that hasn&#039;t happened since. The first week I couldn&#039;t sleep past 4am, and the first morning I woke up with extreme nausea and vomited. I have been on Pristiq for about 6 weeks and really feel amazing. Work through the side effects, they will disappear and hopefully it will work as well for you!""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I cannot begin to tell you how much I hate myself for staying on this for as long as I did. I went from having extremely light and short periods to being on it constantly for the past year and a half. The only reason I was using birth control was so I would feel comfortable and protected during sex. But considering I had my period just about everyday, it was useless. I cannot tell you how many pairs of underwear I&#039;ve ruined or how many boxes of tampons I&#039;ve gone through. Let&#039;s not forget about the dramatic weight gain. In the past year and a half I gained a good 50+ pounds. Yes I know the birth control didn&#039;t put the food in my mouth, but my fast metabolism was shot. Even when I went on diets I did nothing but continue to gain weight!""",8
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I am 32 &amp; have walked around with ADHD for my entire life until a nurse suggested I get screened. My &quot;Doc&quot; told me I was Cyclothymic (Bipolar III) &amp; that I was having panic attacks. I agreed but the symptoms never got better with the prescription I was on. 
I went to have my Echocardiogram &amp; was told I gave Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Long story short, the benefits of this medicine have shown up in the 7 days that I have taken it. My pulse is lower, I haven&#039;t had any &quot;panic attacks&quot; &amp; I&#039;m starting to be able to focus a little better. I can&#039;t urinate as well unless I consume more water but I needed more anyway. 
This medicine has made me feel normal for the first time in many many years.""",1
Paxil,Depression,"""I was prescribed Paxil for situational depression that was pretty severe, merging on PTSD. (I went through a really bad relationship breakup that was traumatic) I also had GAD (general anxiety). I took Paxil for about 8 weeks. It started working right away and I felt so much better I&#039;d say within a day or two. I slept better and woke in the morning without massive anxiety and intrusive thoughts and my depression began to lift. BUT I gained a whopping 20 pounds in the 8 weeks I was on Paxil. It was so awful that I had the doctor wean me off of it . I thought once it was out of my system that the weight would slowly come off but it didn&#039;t - I gained another 10 lbs. I think Paxil messes with your metabolism. Will NEVER take it again.""",5
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""Been on Loestrin 24 for about 4 months. Love the fact that it&#039;s taking care of the terrible menstrual cramps and bloating I used to have. On the flip side, it tends to me sad a lot more but with time I think I can control that. Also I am gaining weight on my hip/thigh area. I really don&#039;t mind if it&#039;s just temporary. So far so good, I like the pill-it&#039;s making my time of the month a really easy time. For 1 month I had no period at all.""",8
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have cystic fibrosis and severe back/neck pain. I needed a stronger medication due to the cystic fibrosis and found that Percocets just made me extremely nauseated. Nucynta can be taken on an empty stomach, and while I experience slight tiredness that was about all. However as time progressed I discovered that it became somewhat less effective and I had to bump up to 10s. When this happened I started having pronounced muscle spasms and issues with regulating my body temp. Also there is no generic so I averaged about $117 per dose. Overall I was pleased with the medicine.  """,9
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""Geodon has been a life saver.  It took awhile to get the right dose and know when to take it (AM versus PM), but I am doing great now.  I take it in the evening and still have morning grogginess after several months.  My doctor prescribed Provigil which really helps (although costly).  I take the Geodon in conjunction with Lamictal.  I have less agitation and find (at least my family finds) that I am much less hostile than before.  Do be careful in the heat as I got very sick from overheating and follow instructions and do not drink alcohol.  One pina colada felt like a whole case of beer.""",6
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been taking Lamictal as a mood stabilizer and a foundation to treat my depression. Found it was insufficient on its own so doctor started me on 40mg of Latuda. It worked very well but I just felt &quot;ok&quot; and it was quite expensive. Tried to switch to Abilify but the restlessness was intolerable and the therapeutic effect wasn&#039;t nearly as palpable. Switched back to Latuda at 60mg and don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever look back. Tried Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Pristiq, Effexor, and Cymbalta also.""",6
Yasmin,Acne,"""I started taking Yasmin after experiencing low moods on a previous pill.  However, I found Yasmin caused me to experience migraines during the week before my periods and also during the week I was having my period.  I also experienced very low and tearful moods which caused arguments with my boyfriend.  None of these aspects improved after a few months and I then had to change to another birth control pill.""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I don&#039;t know whats worse the bleeding for 6 months straight or the horrible depression, anxiety, and mood swings. I thought I was crazy luckily me and my friend both got it together and experienced the exact same side effects. So we both knew it was the implanon. The worst mental breakdown of my life. My hormones finally leveled out and I feel like myself again! It took 7 months of mood swings and bleeding nonstop. But I&#039;m starting to feel normal again. I haven&#039;t removed it because they keep telling me once your hormones stabilize I&#039;ll be fine so I toughed it out. And feel 100% better. I just hope it stays this way.""",8
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I started take this at 30mg a week ago. I have been on so many different medicines none of them work but after only a couple of days I was feeling much better. I drove my car for an hour last night for the first time. 2 years ago I got electrocuted on 440 and I started getting the worse panic attacks. I could not get out of bed most days. I have been on every medicine they make for this. None of them worked but in a week on Cymbalta I feel like I&#039;m almost my old self again. I just turned 25 and I have a 2year old son. So thank you Cymbalta. The only side effect is I can not sleep at all. Maybe an hour here or there but I have not been tired.""",7
Accutane,Acne,"""Im 18 years old &amp; have been suffering with acne since I was 11/12. I tried EVERY over counter spot treatment and every medication prescribed by the doctor. Some worked for a few weeks but my spots always returned. Being a dancer, I have to wear a lot of stage makeup so the doctor telling me &#039;don&#039;t wear makeup&#039; really wasn&#039;t helpful. Finally I was refereed to the hospital and prescribed a 20mg dosage of accutane for a 6 month period. I started my first tablet a month and 5 days ago &amp; I have already seen a reduction in the amount of new breakouts. The side effects have been tough already, I&#039;ve had sore lips &amp; inside my nose like you wouldn&#039;t believe, also had a bit of stomach pain recently &amp; tiredness. Will update my accutane journey in a month:)""",4
Ketorolac,Pain,"""I am a chronic pain patient who recently required bilateral hip-replacement. I have been on Schedule II narcotics for over ten years for Cervical Disc herniation, and 4 Lumbo-Sacral Disc herniations. I was given an MRI which was repeatedly unsuccessful because I couldn&#039;t lay still for more than 8-10 minutes, no where near the required 45-50 minutes needed. I was given 30 mg. IV of Toradol, quite skeptical since the narcotics (140 mg-14 10mg. tablets-of Methadone) I took regularly offered barely any relief. About one hour later, I actually was able to stand upright and walk with virtually no assistance! I believe Toradol worked synergistically with the narcotic; since I&#039;d used it years ago by itself with little effect. It was amazing.""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I first started with 27 mg or concerta when it was giving me no effect my doctor increased to 54 mg. At first I loved it. So great...motivation, energy, concentration etc. But then I realized how bad my anxiety was getting and that my prozac was no longer controlling my anxiety and depression. Concerta caused me to have very severe migraines which cause nausea and dizziness. I would have a migraine in the morning and the only thing that would take it away was the concerta and as soon as it wore off around 5-6pm there came the migraine again!  &amp; I obviously couldn&#039;t take the concerta or I&#039;d be up all night. I am not switched to vyvanse but haven&#039;t tried it yet. If concerta did not cause migraines and anxiety then I would really recommend it.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My son who is nine was just started on Vyvanse for ADD. He was not hyperactive just couldn&#039;t focus.  We struggled with from preschool to third grade. Held him back in first that helped a little. Then third grade about killed him. Medications were my last resort. Scared me to death to put him on medicines, 100% difference. Teacher said it was like a fog lifted. I&#039;m like wow. Decreased appetite only side affect. But not bad.""",1
Elavil,Depression,"""I&#039;m 16 years old and I started taking Zoloft for depression about a year ago. I started off at 25mg then 50mg and things still didn&#039;t seem to be &quot;right.&quot; I was constantly sick and throwing up, and I just felt like it wasn&#039;t working. So they bumped me up to 75mg of Zoloft, and then to 100mg. For my body and age, 100mg was a lot for me to take but it finally made me feel better. I wasn&#039;t as down, but I had awful side affects. I couldn&#039;t sleep, eat, or do anything but lay in bed and I had awful migraines. I was so sick of changing meds but I couldn&#039;t deal with being this sick so on top of the Zoloft I was prescribed Elavil. It was like night and day. Helped me sleep and took all my side effects away!""",5
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve never been thin, always overweight/obese. My appetite is voracious, and I have poor metabolism related to thyroid disease. Within the last year, I have tried countless times to lose weight with no results. I&#039;ve been on Belviq for 2 weeks. It took about 4-5 days before I noticed any change in my appetite and until that time, I did not lose any weight. However, since the medicine has built up in my system, my appetite and cravings are down and my self control is up. I have lost 8.6 lbs. in 10 days. I am working out as well and counting calories, which is much easier to do with the added self control. My only complaint is mild joint/back pain. I can still overeat if I make/allow myself, so you have to be dedicated to losing weight.""",3
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""For the first few months, the medication was very successful in terms of giving me the energy and &quot;drive&quot; to get out of bed and do something with my day. However, there are sexual side effects as climax became near impossible.

This wears off with time, both the energy and the sexual side effects. After my body became accustomed to the medication, I lost the extra energy and I became sexually &quot;functional&quot; again. 

After approximately 6 months, my depression returned and was accompanied by severe anxiety, a condition I had never dealt with before.

I&#039;ve since stopped taking Prozac, and noticed significant improvements in my overall life. My experience with Prozac was that it&#039;s good in the short term, but not for the long haul.""",5
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Vyvanse is the awesomest thing that ever happened to me 4 months ago. At first I would just stare at my teachers and try to listen to them but it would just go out the other ear. But sometimes I was just down the rabbit hole daydreaming. Also when I tried to REMEMBER stuff I would get distracted because that got too boring and moved on. But on Vyvanse I can concentrate with ease. I can REMEMBER stuff without even trying to. Nothing seems boring anymore in school but I hate it how it makes me sweat a lot like under the pits .. ALOT. For me there&#039;s a major loss of appetite like I don&#039;t eat anything once I&#039;m on it beecause food doesn&#039;t sound, look or taste good. But I do get these random cravings.""",1
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""Worked okay but caused fainting spells. Coming off of it (tapering, per doctor&#039;said orders) was terrible. I&#039;ve been told more than once that the way I felt sounded like a heroin addict coming off heroin. I was sick to my stomach,  my entire body was in constant pain, every joint and muscle, headaches, I felt cold one minute and burning up the next, exhausted but couldn&#039;t sleep, nightmares when I could catch a few minutes  and periods of wishing someone would just put me out of my misery. This drug  is dangerous! Imagine if someone ran out and couldn&#039;t taper off. """,5
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Loved that it is so hassle free. You do not have to remember to take a pill everyday or to get a shot every couple of months. It is good for 3 years. I had mine removed because I was fed up with the side effects caused by the hormones. I became EXTREMELY emotional, my hair started shedding, WEIGHT GAIN!!, always feeling sleepy, etc. I could go on. If you are ok dealing with possible side effects then I highly recommend it because everyone will react differently. I had a period twice within the year that I had it. My best friend had it and she was on her period everyday for 2 years so it just depends on your body. I switched to PARAGARD IUD. Bye bye hormones :-)""",8
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking Klonopin for several years, but slowly building up a tolerance.  Doc suggested trying mirtazapine.  Made me very groggy the first night, and I fell asleep quickly.  However, I woke several times during the night, and only ended up getting 3-4 hours of sleep (and felt very groggy the next day).  I might be experiencing some withdrawal from the Klonopin).  Hard to know, but sleep has only gotten worse since the first night, so will likely try something else.""",0
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Abilify for three weeks now.  I also take Klonopin, Celexa, and Trileptal for bipolar II disorder.  The Abilify was added to control my anger and aggression, because sometimes I just wanted to SNAP!  I feel much better now.  So far I&#039;ve only lost weight because it makes me feel queasy and kills my appetite in general.  However, I give it an 8 because it costs a small fortune to be on this medication ($600 a month since I no longer have insurance). It&#039;s made my insomnia worse too. Overall though as long as it doesn&#039;t make me gain weight it still rates high on my scale.""",6
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""As most pointed out here, pretty much useless.  Had hoped for a new thing since I&#039;ve had insomnia (actually, shifted phase sleep rhythm), for most my life.  So for now, though it&#039;s losings it&#039;s effect due to being on it for years, I&#039;d highly recommend Lunesta.  (It&#039;s not perfect, but it does work, especially for double insomnia.) Also, a generic is now finally available (cheap and, just as important, it is the ONLY sleep med currently approved by the FDA for LONG TERM use!  Ambien is NOT.""",0
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Everyone&#039;s different and some folks won&#039;t need the 20 mg a day. This medicine makes you feel like you never had an issue with cravings. They are gone, 100%,. After a while you forget what it was to have cravings and you may think the medicine isn&#039;t really doing anything, but try skipping it for a day or two and it will all come back to you! I still want to eat, just not bad stuff or big portions. I get hungry, but never so much so that I can&#039;t make good choices. That&#039;s the beauty of it. I think it will have to be made available for maintenance, maybe a lower dose, not sure. I wish more doctors knew about it. So many people are missing out on something that could really help them.""",3
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on the medicine for 3 weeks and lost 8 pounds.  I would love to continue.  However, possible side effects of this medication are depression, mental confusion, suicidal thoughts, etc.  I have struggled in the past with depression.  This medicine has has ignited a fire in my brain.  I am at the point where I seriously think I&#039;m going crazy.  I urge you to disclose fully to your doctor if you suffer from chronic depression and urge you to reconsider taking this medicine.  I begged my husband to commit me yesterday, that was my mental state.  I&#039;m seeing my doctor Monday to figure out a different course of action now.""",3
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I am a healthy 21 year old but have trouble getting and staying asleep. I have tried melatonin and I feel it may help me get to sleep but not stay asleep. The other night I laid awake until 5:30 am trying to keep my eyes closed with no luck. So the next day I researched some over the counter sleep aids and Unisom had great reviews, so that day I picked some up. I took one at ten that night and started getting sleepy an hour later. By 11:30 I was fast asleep. Although I woke up a few times throughout the night, as I usually do, I was still tired and found it very easy to fall back to sleep without tossing and turning for ten minutes at a time. I woke up at 9:00am the next day felling minimally drowsy. I will continue to take Unisom""",0
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""Only giving this drug a 5/10 because it has only been about a week and most medications work well for the first week.
However, at the moment things are going much better for me! I was at a point where I was crying and snapping at people almost constantly. 
I&#039;m now taking 25mg of vistaril in the morning and 0.5mg klonopin before bed. The vistaril doesn&#039;t make me tired at all, just strangely calm (not in a tranquilized way) and the klonopin helps me actually sleep. For now, this seems to be a great medication and a great combination as well.""",7
OxyContin,Pain,"""My Primary Care Physician put me on Oxycontin for about a year and a half prior to having shoulder surgery. I had recently started a new job and did not have enough leave time to have the surgery. The only reason I survived and was able to work and have a half way normal life with less pain was through the use of Oxycontin. When I was finally able to have the Rotator Cuff surgery, my Surgeon said I would have to be off of Oxycontin for at least a month prior to the surgery because he could not give me anything stronger for pain after surgery and feared I would have a tolerance and that Oxy that would lessen the effect. No problem, I just stopped taking it. That was when the honeymoon was over.""",9
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I am on day 4 now and I am pretty spacey.  I feel like I have smoked weed honestly. However, I started at 277 and I am at 272 this morning. I am taking 50 mg twice a day. So I think what I will do since I have to work is cut them in have and do half in the morning half at lunch half at dinner and half at bed time so its not so crazy. Lol. It does cause slight memory loss and a little tingly feeling but its not unbearable. I have noticed I do not want any sweets. I crave fruit. And veggies. Or nothing. I had 36 cookies on my desk Friday and didn&#039;t eat one of them... This is very worth it. And the side effects do wear off after a while. Thats how I know its time to take another half. I will update later. Yay I extremely happy!!""",2
Prozac,Depression,"""I have tried everything from tricyclics,  serzone lexapro,  Welbutrin,  celexa, everthing under the sun. I just recently started on prozac about 2 weeks ago  (straight from lexapro) and the results have been amazing! I  sleep well,  my dreams are pleasant now and my brain doesn&#039;t over analyze everything.  I  wake up early feeling good which I  haven&#039;t in years.  I have ambition and energy, get shit done and look for more to do. Finally something that works! I  haven&#039;t had the opportunity to see if there are any sexual side effects yet but hopefully soon! Lol.""",5
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Absolute nightmare. I&#039;ve have Nexplanon in my arm for 9 months and I&#039;ve never experienced a more uncomfortable birth control in my life. I&#039;ve never had acne in my life, now I break out all the time. Mood swings left and right that have led to full on breakdowns. I&#039;m always tired, can&#039;t get out of bed some days. Get used to getting your period twice a month. Currently I&#039;m on a period that has lasted over 3 weeks straight and I&#039;m not talking spotting- it&#039;s a full on blood bath with visible clotting. I&#039;m losing a lot of blood and it&#039;s completely ruined my sex life. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this to my worst enemy.""",8
Strattera,ADHD,"""I have a now 10 yo son that was diagnosed with ADD &amp; ADHD when he was 7. His Dr. has put him on all  different types of meds since.  The only one we found that seemed to work for him, was Vyvanse, well now he&#039;s on Strattera 18 MG and I had to rush him to the ER because he was complaining about his chest bothering him, and I mean really bad.  They said he was fine, besides his heart rate,which was really really high, but they didn&#039;t see anything wrong. I mentioned he was on Strattera, and they said that the meds can be a big part of it.  I took him off of it for the next two days, and he was fine. Started him back on it, and a week later, (2/6/16) he was having pains in his chest again, so I&#039;ve been trying to get a hold of his Dr to stop it.""",1
Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed pristiq last year for depression &amp; anxiety. At 1st I did not want to take any meds due to a bad experience with Prozac when I was 30. I am now in my 50s. After the first day I felt amazingly better. I got up early &amp; felt incredible clarity, focus &amp; worthiness. At that time I weighed 120. I gained 5lbs &amp; probably lost muscle. Prior to pristiq I was very physically active. I feel very calm now &amp; go for walks but for whatever reason I do not work out like I did before. Soon after getting on pristiq I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism even though I was quite fit &amp; thin. So I was put on levothyroxine for that condition. I would say the weight gain &amp; some sleepiness has been a side effect for me but not sure from which medicine.""",7
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on this medication since 2006. I had no side effects or problems. It worked well, we had to keep increasing my dosage on it though. I also combined it with Depakote, which apparently raises your Lamictal levels. Yes you can become toxic on this medication like Depakote. I had to get off the medication because I became toxic, I was taking 300mg a day and 1250mg of Depakote daily. My symptoms were drunk look, double vision, slurred speech, short term memory loss, I started bumping into walls, my eyes were glazed over. I just got stupid towards the end. I even went to the hospital telling them I was toxic, they did not believe me. It can happen, I guess I became intolerant of the medication.""",6
Ativan,Anxiety,"""I developed anxiety attacks, as many do after a Total Thyroidectomy.  I suffered for a year with inadequate thyroid treatment and all the awful things that come with it. Then developed panic/anxiety attacks.  They would last 6 or 7 hours at a time.  I would barely feel better and then I got another. Ativan helped in 15 minutes. I&#039;ve been taking it for two months and it has given me back the small part left of my post-thyroid life. Thanks to my thyroidectomy, I will never be well again.  But at least I don&#039;t have panic attacks.""",7
Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Zyprexa 10mg/day for about 10 years. When I first started taking it in place of Risperdal I felt out of sorts for a few weeks. My doctor said that I was adjusting to it and that I needed to wait it out. So I waited and I did adjust. I gained weight on the medicine, which I have since lost. My psychiatrist orders blood work once a year to check my cholesterol and he says that everything is fine. I don&#039;t like that I need a lot of rest but that is preferable over manic insomnia. I thought that if I stopped taking it then I could lose more weight but I know that I need to manage my illness. I&#039;d rather be plump and pleasant than skinny and crazy. I just have to diet and exercise. The world accepts plump better than it accepts crazy.""",6
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve suffered from ADHD,  Bipolar 2 with major depression and  anxiety  for years. I have to say I&#039;ve found the right combination to give me some stability.  I started with respidol  2 mg 2x a day, Citalopram 20 mg a day, lorazapam 0.5mg a day &amp; 10 mg 2x a day of adderal. While I should say that the medication worked well for my depression and psychosis.  I had to stop taking  respidol because I gained 20 lbs in the first 4 months of taking it. It made me sleepy , no motivation whatsoever. So we repalaced it with
lamictal 25 mg2x @2 &amp; 9pm, adderall 20 MG.1x. @6am, Citalopram 40 MG 1x@9am, lorazapam 0.5 2x@1 &amp; 6pm. So no medication takes away 4rm the other. Taking adderal &amp; lamictal together will decrease adderall effectiveness.""",6
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""I am 21 year&#039;s old- this medication is not just for young children- it has taken away the side-effects of my ADHD medication. The only side-effect I was aware of was auditory! When I took the 1st 1mg pill, my hearing was heightened and exhaustive (sounds dragged out) for an hour or so. When I increased to 2mg the same thing happened: a noticeable difference in my hearing for just a short hour or so. My doctor prescribed this to me when the side-effects of Concerta did not leave me; I had anxiety that was clearly not situational but from the drop-off of Concerta in the middle of the day as it is not a steady released medicine but a ADHD medication that releases a dose twice.""",1
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I travel a lot. I eat out a lot as a result. I have gained a lot of weight because of my job. I just don&#039;t have the time to exercise. My doctor got concerned when my BMI ballooned to 38. I started Belviq and I pay $75 per month. Cheaper than the other TV weight loss systems and I won&#039;t try the GNC stuff. Not safe! I lost 22 pounds this summer and so far I am pleased. No real side effects to report. For me, $75 is a lot per month but I was spending more on food! Lunch and dinner would cost me $20 a day, 4-5x per week.""",3
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got Skyla inserted almost a month ago. My cramps and lower back pain were bad for a few days, and 1600 mg ibuprofen daily didn&#039;t help much. (My periods are usually heavy and painful; I had vaginal delivery without anesthesia. The pain from the Skyla could be compared to my worst period cramping.) By the end of the first week they became tolerable, but I was still spotting. There were 2 or 3 days when I didn&#039;t spot, then I started having bad cramps again + spotting, and a long and painful period followed that was a little lighter than usual.
Well, I&#039;m still spotting/bleeding and having cramps and obviously not pregnant because I have no mood when I&#039;m in constant pain.
I&#039;m willing to give this method another 2 months...""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m introverted and suffered some depression and anxiety due to a recent IRS audit and personal problems at home , I landed in the hospital for 4 days after test on my heart etc everything cleared but stress and anxiety , I&#039;m 40 and in good shape , Dr put me on Lexapro , first two weeks were brutal , emotional rollercoster and insomia, I asked my Dr if he was sure these were not estrogen pills. After two weeks I started to feel awesome , better then before I&#039;m on my eighth week and lost weight , motivated to go to gym , tolerate my wife&#039;s extroverted friends , I feel better then I did my entire life , even before my depression issues , crowds and loud people go over my head nothing irritates me anymore , sexual sides I last longer win win""",7
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I would say I had a good experience with Aldactone.  My skin did clear, although I do remember having a little bit of a break-out now and then.  I started taking the medicine about 6 months before my wedding (I was age 29 then) and I stopped a couple months after the wedding.  My skin looked very good and the breakouts diminished. I don&#039;t think I experienced any bad cystic type acne then.  I used the highest dosage of Retin A (just a tiny bit) at night also along with a Cetaphil moisturizer.  Since I was getting married, I was very cautious about weight gain and I don&#039;t think I gained weight from the medication, although I was going to the gym regularly and doing weight regimens. I think I&#039;m going on it again. I will also go on Epiduo.""",4
Didrex,Obesity,"""I was severely obese and didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing to myself I was basically killing myself or eating myself to death. I was 400 lbs. When I started this med I noticed an instant change in not only what I was doing to myself but it gave me energy I didn&rsquo;t have. It sort of woke me up and made me realize what I already knew  -that I didn&rsquo;t like what I saw in the mirror. That was almost 10 years ago. Today I am my ideal weight for my height 130lbs and I could not be happier. I have lost the weight and kept it off.""",2
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""My experience with Skyla has been rough. For the record, I&#039;ve never had kids and am fairly petite.The insertion process was, as most people have said, fairly painful. Maybe a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. I took ibuprofen before the insertion, but my OBGyn accidentally clipped my cervix, which led to some bleeding. The cramps after the insertion got increasingly bad. I&#039;ve had ulcers, and I can say these cramps were the worst pain I have ever been in. These cramps have continued almost every day for the past 6 weeks, and have severely impacted my life. My last period lasted 12 days with heavy  and it&#039;s starting again 15 days later with terrible cramping. If you have another option (which I don&#039;t), I would not recommend this insertion.""",8
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""Too make a long story short, a little over 2 weeks ago after an MRI, we were told our daughter had a birth defect called Chiari which required brain surgery, which is scheduled for September 9, 2011.  My anxiety was so bad I couldn&#039;t function normally and couldn&#039;t stop crying, couldn&#039;t sleep, had chest pains and my head was so lightheaded I thought I would pass out. Xanax stopped all of it. I only rate it an 8, not because of how it works, but because of me. I still can&#039;t control my anxiety without help from Xanax. Now I can sleep, breath and only cry once a day if at all. I&#039;m seeing a shrink and feeling stronger so maybe soon I will be in control of myself again and handle my families life again as a strong mom and woman.""",7
Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have neuropathic pain, seizures and bipolar disorder all which can be treated by Gabapentin.  At first it seemed like I wasn&#039;t taking anything but after getting on 3600mg/day it has really improved my life.  My pain is tolerable, the simple-partial seizures are well managed and I am calm all the time.  It took a large dose to work for me but I am glad I tried it.  My only complaint is that if I stand up quickly I get dizzy.  But relative to everything else I don&#039;t mind.""",6
Fentanyl,Pain,"""Broke my back on L2 and L3.  Was sent home the same day from hospital.  Had a failed spinal surgery 4 years later as the breaks never fused.  The surgery was 12 hours after the surgery Hydromorphone wasnt enough.  So i was put on the Fentanyl 150mcg/h every 2 days .  It helped my pain for full time pain management with Hydromorphone for breakthrough pain.
I wish Fentanyl was never invented.
I have lost all my teeth but 6 and my stomach is always upset, and i have been trying to come off it for a year now, unfortunately I  cant find a medication that controls my pain like fentanyl""",9
Accutane,Acne,"""My face was horrendous before I used (ro)Accutane, to the point I couldn&#039;t see out of my left eye due to the level of spots/boils I had swelling up and becoming one. I noticed a difference on Accutane after a month or so, but the real improvements start after approximately 2 months depending on how bad you have it (mine was really bad and aggressive). I would definitely recommend reading the book of side effects you are given, I am &quot;lucky&quot; as I only really suffered with depression, which as most of us know you do so if you have acne anyway. One recommendation is not going in direct sun light until a month or so after finishing the treatment, and finding a very good face and lip moisturiser and these 2 parts will become very very dry!""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the Implanon inserted in June 2011 and had it taken out recently in June 2014 when my three year mark was up. I&#039;m giving it a six because it did prevent pregnancy in my case. Pros from my experience: No periods &amp; no pregnancies.
Cons from my experiences: 80lbs weight gained(I also had some family issues, work &amp; school. Not blaming it all on the birth control). NO sex drive at all I was never in the mood, and my feet seemed to get bigger. Other than that its a great birth control. It works effectively on other people. Some have no weight gain and some do. I do recommended this because it does work great for preventing pregnancy!""",8
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""Good long-term analgesia with the extended release formula, which seems to work for over 8 hours, though I don&#039;t think it has the full 12-hour benefit as advertised. Less &#039;fuzziness&#039; than oxycodone (or even hydrocodone), which is a positive for me. I suppose it&#039;s not so good for &quot;recreational&quot; users - the new ER formula is supposed to be highly abuse-proof - but for those is REAL chronic pain, Opana-ER works well, similar to Oxycontin, and is very easy to use - one dose in the morning, another in the evening.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Adipex-P on October 21, 2012. My starting weight was 267 and I&#039;m a 5&#039;2&quot; 22 year old female. When I went back to the doctor 6 weeks later I weighed in at 247... so 20 lbs in 6 week. I almost started crying in the doctor&#039;s office. I have never in my life been told that I had lost a good amount of weight (maybe just a pound or two at checkups which probably had mostly to do with clothing or water weight). The second time I went back I weighted in at 231. Totaling 36lbs. All of which I wasn&#039;t exercising. I had dry mouth a lot and no interest in food what so ever. Now on my home scale about a month since weighing in last time I am down to about 225. 42lbs in 21 weeks =)""",3
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I started contrave on March 23rd.  I have not had any side effects and try to take it with some yogurt.  I am 5&#039;5 and weigh 250lbs.  After taking this medicine for 4 days I have lost 5lbs.  I am pretty happy with the results so far.  Will update later after I&#039;ve been on it for a while.  My insurance would not cover it originally but my doctor faxed over for a prior authorization and my insurance approved it so I only had to pay $47.""",3
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve used a numerous of medicines over 25 yrs. Gabapentin helps but not the best. THE type of my insomnia is rare. Only 1 in 100 thousand have the type that I have.

BUT that&#039;s very hard when trying to hold down a job and maintaining my family.

I am trying to drink as much water as possible.  I&#039;m trying to eat my roughage, and I&#039;ve also started eating fruit that tastes pretty good.

Miltown,Anxiety,"""Benzodiazepines, are way better. Valium or clonazepam have a VERY long half life.(last about 18-24hours) This medicines work great for me, for overall Anxiety. In my case Xanax is the only drug that helps with my Panic Attacks. It works the fastest. And that is very important, when you have a bad event,   like Panic Attacks. Not Anxiety attacks, there is a big difference. Panic is a Event(Can last awhile).These can give you aftershocks after the initial event and initial dose of Xanax. Anxiety attacks don&#039;t last long, and are not near as bad. Panic Attacks can be up to 10 times worse, than anxiety attacks. No triggers needed for Panic, in my case. Anxiety attacks usually center around  stress, difficult situations, etc.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve only been on phentermine 37.5 since June 23, 2015.  My starting weight was 220 at 5&#039;5&quot; and this morning I weighed in at 214.8.  I take it every morning as soon as I get up in the morning with 1-2 cups of water.  It does make me really thirsty (so I have been drinking more water) and the first few days, my sleep was so off and I felt really jittery. I have definitely noticed that I don&#039;t eat as much. Even if I try to eat a lot, I feel bad so I don&#039;t try much :)  I try to attend boot camp 1-3 times a week.  I can&#039;t wait to see results within the next week and days to come.""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on Adipex for 3 days now and I&#039;ve lost 5 pounds. I&#039;m 5&#039;2 and started out at 221.2 pounds three days ago. This morning I got on the scale at I&#039;m at 216. I&#039;ve read a lot of reviews and its about %50 people who love it and %50 people who hate it. My main concern is the reviews where people say the minute they stop the pill the weight comes right back plus more. But so far so good for me.""",3
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""My sleep has progressively gotten worse as I have grown older, now 60.  I have tried five other drugs with no success.  Lunesta worked better than others but would only work a couple of nights then nothing and I felt groggy and had constant headaches.
The doctor gave me Amitriptyline 50mg and the first night, while a little jittery I fell asleep in about 20 minutes and slept most of the night, getting up and changing rooms, then falling back to sleep again.  The second night I tossed and turned most of the night.  Tonight is number three so I am hoping that the side effects subside.  Will update in a few days.  I am still battling major headaches with this drug as I did with Lunesta.  Hoping for success tonight.""",0
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""After 6 years of different meds that never worked I was put on 20mg of latuda. Didn&#039;t do anything, didn&#039;t work at all. Doc upped it to 40mg. Taking 40mg gave me maybe 3 weeks of terrible headaches and nausea. Then one morning I woke up and actually felt good, well rested, clear-headed...was such a strange feeling to me. Then I turned on some music and I actually FELT music again, I started dancing around while getting ready. Started reaching out socially, started exercising, and started actually taking a shower every morning again! I can not express in words how good and normal I feel, I actually feel things again. Latuda did a 180 degree change on my life, thanks to the researchers who created this drug, you guys are amazing!""",6
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed this to help with my severe anxiety and in hopes it would also help my chronic pain.
I think I&#039;m allergic to it because in 2 hours of taking it I got a stabbing pain in my head and the light made my eyes burn. I could barely even say this to a doctor because along with barely being able to string two words together I had intense nausea with cramping and it wasn&#039;t until the ER had the lights around me dimmed enough for me to try and open my eyes I realized my face was pretty swollen.""",7
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had this put in at my post partum check up back in January and I so far love it. I have put on weight, but that&#039;s because I boredom eat. I&#039;ve always had bad adult acne, so I haven&#039;t noticed that side effect. My period is wonky, pretty much all of February I had it, and part of March. Have it a few days, gone a few days, etc. I haven&#039;t had my period since March though. This has been my favorite birth control.""",8
Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorde,"""Zyprexa was effective at sedating me which prevented the psychotic aspects of my manic episodes from happening very quickly. Since I only had 2 manic episodes in the span of a year, I probably should&#039;ve stopped taking Zyprexa around 6 months later. Unfortunately I took it for 5 more years which was a MASSIVE mistake. It caused me to be very drowsy and lethargic. Because I started taking it at age 19, I didn&#039;t realize the Zyprexa was the culprit until I stopped taking it. I thought I was just a sleepy person. It had a profoundly negative impact on my life because I took it way longer than I should have.""",6
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Feeling alive again but still having panick attacks.
I&#039;ve been on 10mg for the past month  but I noticed every time I have drinks,  the next  day I have nasty p&acirc;nic attacks. They are awful.  Its been only a month.  Does it get better after 2 months.  I like this medicine, I feel alive again. I wanna jump out of my bed and go to the gym at 6am like before! I haven&#039;t felt like this in a year! Before all I wanted to do was sleep and stay attached to my bed.  
I love this med but i think I&#039;ll need to upper the dose for my anxiety.  :&#039;(""",7
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""This is a miracle for me. I have experienced abrupt withdrawal, but that was my fault and all that happened was my vision was extremely blurred and I was in bed a few days. Do not drink with this medication, take it AS needed instead of all the time, then you won&#039;t have withdrawals if you forget to take it. I don&#039;t understand why this old trusted medication isn&#039;t prescribed more often, it never produced &quot;euphoria&quot; or anything like that for me or anyone I know on it - but it&#039;s dangerous with alcohol I guess and so many people drink. I&#039;ve been on 6mg a day - which I found way too much and went down to 2mg on my own.""",7
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I take this for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Was taking 850 Mg of Seroquel 1 in the morning 1 in the afternoon and 2 at night before bed time. I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. This is something like having both schizophrenia and bipolar at the same time. I did not like taking Seroquel because it made me gain weight and I felt like I always had to keep moving. I was put on Latuda 40 MG and it seems to work. I have been taking it for a week now. Almost no side effects. I am still here and see things that are not there but the Latuda helps me know what is real and not and it helps me better handle them. It works as good as any other one I have tried but side effect free. I highly recommend trying this out.""",6
Dapsone,Acne,"""I got a bad bout of the flu in March and had to go on 10 days of antibiotics. My face started breaking out the worst it ever had in 7 yrs. After getting a cystic pimple every day for 10 days I went to the dermatologist. She prescribed Aczone and Epiduo.  Also got 3 injections to the cheeks. I have been applying the medicine for 4 days now. My face has calmed considerably in these few days and is actually smooth. I see some pimples coming up on my cheeks where I was breaking out before but instead of them becoming cystic-hard, painful-they come up as small white heads and after showering just wipe away. Face is dry but I don&#039;t mind as I have oily skin. Could be too soon to tell but I have seen a difference in 4 days. """,4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""Last year(2015) I was doing the 21 day fix and had gotten down to 155. I&#039;m 5&#039;4&quot; so 135-140ish is my goal weight. I&#039;m a full time student right now and with a child it&#039;s hard to cook super healthy meals all the time. Between spring and fall semester I had gained 25lbs. I was put on birth control for my PCOS in May. Since then I&#039;ve gained another 18lbs. I just started taking this medicine and its amazing!! The energy I have helps me get thru my workout and the rest of my day. I&#039;m an emotional/boredom eater and it&#039;s usually sweets so the fact that it curbs my cravings is awesome. I&#039;m excited to see how I will look at the end of 6mo and hopefully I get get myself back on track with eating healthy""",3
Neurontin,Pain,"""Couldn&#039;t sleep at night because of back pain, doctor gave me these along with regular pain medicines. Besides being a little over weight, I&#039;m as healthy as a horse. These gave me the best nights sleep of my life. I couldn&#039;t lift my arms and just felt as relaxed as I have ever been in my life! Didn&#039;t feel groggy in the morning, totally awesome! I don&#039;t take them EVERY night as prescribed, but after living with this pain for so long, I know when there is going to be a bad night (say, after mowing the lawn). I take one before bedtime and VIOLA! I have a great nights sleep and still feel awesome in the morning! It&#039;s a miracle drug!""",9
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I started taking this drug 6-7 years ago for school and planned to quit when I graduated because it made me anti-social, increase tobacco usage, and want to play video games all night. It was really effecting my personal and social life, plus I hated all of the physical effects (heart rate, cold hands, sweat). However, I enjoyed the high it gives you, and continued taking it after graduating. It helps lock you down at the computer and make boring work less boring. Now, I cannot stop taking it. Every night I lay in bed saying &quot;Ok I have to stop this&quot;., then the next morning I wake up and can&#039;t resist taking it. I am going to tell my doctor to cancel my prescription because the cons HEAVILY outweigh the pros.""",1
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""This drug has been a miracle for me.  I take it with Abilify (5 mgs) - and it has been a God-send.  I was on a triple combination of Cymbalta, Welbutrin and Abilify and still did not feel well.  Pristiq has helped me tremendously from within a week of onset.  I have struggled with depression since 1991 - and have been on a variety of &quot;cocktails&quot; but this one is working the best so far.  I still struggle with sleep and anxiety - as I have problems with Doctors treating my anxiety disorder as it should be.  Interesting that physicians will treat some things an not others.  My only complaint is lacking in sleep - other wise I would recommend this medicine to anyone struggling with depression.""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""42 year old male recently diagnosed with ADD (no hyperactivity).  Vyvanse is the only medication I&#039;ve tried and I&#039;m reasonably happy with it.  Started 30 mg for 2 weeks.  Felt a little jittery and had a funny taste in my mouth.  Increased to 70 mg.  No longer feel jittery, no funny taste, but my mouth is always dry so I drink a lot of water.

Vyvanse seems to help me get more done.  I can&#039;t say I&#039;m more focused, but I am more motivated, so the end result is more productivity, though not always directed in the best place.

It decreased my appetite, so it was easier to switch to a healthier diet.  Lost more than 25 lbs. in first 3 months, which has also helped increase self esteem, motivation and energy level.""",1
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I&#039;m 33 years old  5&#039;5&quot; and 164 lbs. This is the heaviest I&#039;ve ever been. My weight keeps climbing and I keep justifying it by buying a larger size. I really enjoy Candy I was up to 4 bars per day not including the little single pieces in the Jolly Ranchers. I used to go to a weight loss clinic which gave me 105 mg it worked wonderfully. I would take 1 pill around 10:30 am and it would curb my appetite ALL day! For the first time I did Not Crave candy! They worked Great for me. However, It came at a high price. I was paying $50 per week. So this time I went to my primary Dr. and she was able to prescribe me the same thing and I spent $3.96 with my insurance . Awesome!!! It still works I&#039;ve lost 6 lbs in 5 days. Love it!""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Adipex 3/6/08, I was 182 lbs. By 6/3/08, I was down to 152 lbs. 30 lb loss is great. I have 7 lbs to go.  The program is great, if you follow your diet plan and stay hydrated. 200cal.for breakfast at 7am, 350cal. lunch at 12pm, and 450cal. for dinner at 6pm absolutely no  snacking in between. My only problem was constipation. Suddenly ceasing the medicine may cause side effects.  Overall I love Adipex. Love it, Love it, Love it!""",3
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had Skyla for a month. Several of my friends, with and without children, have Mirena and almost everyone told me it was no big deal, a little cramping, etc. Let me tell you, it was the most painful experience of my life. I am not a wimp. My doctor had to clamp(!) my cervix and it hurt so bad upon insertion that I got immediately nauseous and almost fainted. The nurse held my hand and basically let me squeeze her to death the whole time. It took 10 minutes to insert. Afterwards I got the worst cramps of my life, and it took a full 24 hours for me to be able to recover. I&#039;ve been spotting ever since. Cramps went away after a week. No crazy mood swings. No weight gain. No acne. I haven&#039;t had a period yet. Just lots of spotting.""",8
Belviq,Obesity,"""I&#039;m 5&#039;10 and 298 lbs. tried all diets and failed at all of the. Decided to try Belviq. My doctor was against it because he was worried about side effects. I told him I was in more danger by not losing the weight. I Was really worried as I was also starting a new job and needed to travel 90% of the time. Eating on the road and everyone warned me when they started they all gained weight. I decided that wasn&#039;t going to get worse! I&#039;ve been out my first week and started Belviq at the same time. It&#039;s day five and I&#039;m never hungry no cravings a and it&#039;s amazing. I have no idea how it will continue and no idea if I&#039;ve lost anything but my rings fit better and my watch slides around already.

Some days I&#039;m still hungry though. It hasn&#039;t even been a month and today I weigh 224. That&#039;s 26 pounds in 27 days almost a pound a day with no exercise. The results for me have been amazing. I do have trouble sleeping so I usually take the pill earlier in the morning. I take a whole one a day. I also have had severe dry mouth mainly the last 3 days but I&#039;m also taking a water pill.""",2

Tried to contact doctor who prescribed and have received no reply, therefore after talking to pharmacist and school nurse, and health unit care provider, I have decided to stop Vyvanse, 30mg daily, until I receive some reply from his doctor. Then I am going to ask for something else.  If it works fine for your children, God bless, but please keep an eye on them for the first 24 hours; allergic reactions do occur, we were just lucky it was not more severe.""",1
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I give it an 8 or 10.....the other end would be a 1/10 :)
DO NOT take this during your waking hours...Yeesh
This was prescribed for pain related to Neuropathy. I was told to take one before sleep and I would be good to go. Suffice to say, I have no idea if I hurt in my sleep because THIS PILL is the proverbial sledge hammer.
 I have an odd metabolism. I take one AROUND 4pm and I start yawning by 9....and do not wake for a MINIMUM of 12 hours.
SO!
If you need sleep...this will do it. If you need pain relief at night...well, I suppose if you are unconscious, that works as well :) Sometimes I wake with back pain from having to pee so bad. if your bladder is weak, you may have &quot;other&quot; issues""",0
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""&bull;  Comprehension: Before:  If you wanted me to pay attention, understand something, or even acknowledge it, you would often have to repeat it several times.  I would misread or misunderstand things more than the average person.
 After:  I understand most communication right away, including the emotions and attitude of the other person, which were often not even on my radar before.
 &bull;  Interpersonal Communication: Before:  I was very likely to interrupt others.  I wouldn&#039;t wait for others to speak before continuing my conversation.  I came across as very harsh &amp; critical. After:  I&#039;m better at engaging in appropriate give-and-take in conversation.  I communicate in a much appropriate friendly tone.
Dealing with adversity:
Before: Even trivial matters would provoke a negative reaction, ruin my mood or trigger impulsive/disruptive behavior. I&rsquo;d get down on myself for minor mistakes
After: Even when things don&rsquo;t go the way I like them to go, I handle things in a much more mature, measured way. When something goes wrong, I&rsquo;m more likely to laugh it off than I used to. I&rsquo;m more even keeled, less likely to fly off the handle.""",1

After a recommendation from a friend i decided to make a change and start on 50mg of prestiq. Im a relatively small person 5&#039;5 130 pounds and immediately felt the effects of the medication. I had a huge surge of energy that was a little overwhelming. I was much more sociable and confident, also my curiosity was dramatically increased and i managed to blaze through several books in a weeks time. This was a huge shift in my normal behavior which was generally lazy and unfocused. Now I&#039;ve been on the drug for about 3 months and the effects aren&#039;t as noticeable but I&#039;d say my life has changed for the better.""",5

I can&#039;t really tell if it&#039;s working yet since I&#039;m only in my second week, but so far I&#039;m not too optimistic. I was on Wellbutrin before and that had little to no effect on me.

When I take it in the morning, I start to feel sweaty and shaky about 45 minutes later, but if I eat half a bowl of cereal and put my hair in a ponytail, then I am fine. The rest of the day when I take it, it does curb my appetite, but I still get hungry and I still like the taste of my favorite foods so I&#039;ll continue to eat after I&#039;m full.

I do get the dry mouth that others have said, but I don&#039;t have the energy boost, I do however have to pee like every 30-60 minutes I think it&#039;s because of the amount of water I&#039;m drinking now.""",3
Embeda,Pain,"""I began using Embeda about a month ago for chronic pain. I have had 2 back surgeries and 2 shoulder surgeries due to a severe case of early onset degenerative arthritis, combined with an autoimmune disorder.  Before the Embeda I was taking Percocet for pain management, but it left me feeling irritable when the medication wore off. The Embeda has worked GREAT for me. I am on 20-0.8MG every 24 hours. I like it because I don&#039;t get a &quot;high&quot; feeling and when it wears off I don&#039;t feel irritable. It does cause me increased sweating and constipation and some mild itching, but the trade-off is worth it. It has worked so well for me that I feel like I have my life back.""",9
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I took 15 mg dose for about a year almost nightly. At best it only had a mild effect at helping me fall asleep and did not allow me to sleep longer than my usual four to five hours. Two unfortunate side effects occurred. Occasionally I would get sleep paralysis which is being fully aware mentally while your body is frozen in a sleep State. This lasts for a few minutes. The other unfortunate side effect is intense grogginess for most of the next day. I found that I spent much of the time during that year sitting in a chair during the day because I did not have the mental or physical energy to get up and do anything. Obviously one gets a tolerance for the drug soon and I would say that after about a month there was virtually no benefit""",0
Maprotiline,Depression,"""I have been taking maprotiline for over 35 years and I am still taking it (there seemed to be a shortage for a while about 2 years ago but Walgreens still carries it). I started having panic attacks with the onset of my allergy to dust mites when I was a teenager. In my 20&#039;s, I went into a deep depression and couldn&#039;t sleep for 3 months. I started taking maprotiline and 3 improvements occurred: 1) My depression subsided and then went away. 2) My panic attacks stopped. 3) The almost daily sneezing episodes associated with my allergy subsided, and now, they occur maybe twice and month. My runny sinuses also dried up considerably. I twice tried taking myself off of the medication--it didn&#039;t work. All problems returned after about 10 days.""",5
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I have been taking this now for two months. I am currently at 31 lbs weight loss and I feel better than ever. It works great as an appetite suppressant, I don&#039;t have any of those carbohydrate cravings and my energy and focus are through the roof. I have no jitters, restlessness, or any of the side effects mentioned. I am very happy with this product. In addition to the medication I have been on a high protein, low fat, low carb diet with occasional exercise. I try to exercise at least 3 days a week, but it usually ends up being 1 to 2 days a week because something always comes up. I have been on diets and pills for 15 years and this is the first thing that has ever worked for me and been pleasant too. Would recommend to anyone.""",2

I lost about 6 pounds my first 2 weeks and then the next 3-4 pound a week on the next few weeks.  For me, the best way to take it was 1 hour before breakfast.  When I started to notice that my weight loss was slowing down, I would stop taking the pills for 2 weeks, and started them again.  This helps to get it going again, just be strict not to lose the healthy eating and exercise in that time.  Phentermine caused me some insomnia in the beginning but then it stopped.  Causes some dryness of the mouth but it&#039;s good because it makes you drink more water, which is great!""",3

He has nightmares, where he see&#039;s things &amp; he screams in his dreams but not truly out loud. In the first month we both experienced our limbs jerking as we tried to fall asleep. Now he hears a loud buzzing noise &amp; then a loud bang &amp; he wakes up with his heart racing.

I was taking oxycodone for 1 1/2 years before my spine specialist put me on this medication. I love that I&#039;m not tired and can do things again.

Anyways, I&#039;ve had it for 2 weeks now and there&#039;s only one down side on this for me and to the spotting. My body is still getting used to this and I have recently had a miscarriage so I&#039;m thinking I&#039;ll spot and have light cramps for a few more weeks.

She put me on 20mg and I have been on 20mg for more than six months now.  My life has changed.  I have never felt so alive and so real.  I have never felt so sane.

Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My son has been taking the medication for a week on Tuesday and all I have to say is that he is doing a lot better. His teacher noticed a difference on the first day, so did my son. He stated to me that he can actually focus on lessons and listen to the lesson with no problem.  The only thing that I can say is that my son said that he doesn&#039;t want to eat as much but he eats anyway because he knows he needs to and at night he wakes up once.  The doctor did tell us that, that may happen in the beginning but that it will ware off.""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 23 and have tried just about every ADHD medication out there. I&#039;ve been on Vyvanse for some time now and it&#039;s great! I have energy, I can focus at work and school. It lasts the entire day and then some. The only drawback is you won&#039;t eat. You&#039;ll be hungry your stomach will growl but you can&#039;t eat. Sleeping is tough because it&#039;s a stimulant so I was put on sleep meds to help. You might have a jittery feeling and increased heart rate at first. It takes about an hour or so to kick in but it&#039;s a fantastic medicine. It&#039;s also very powerful. All you gotta do is NOT take it past 2pm at absolute LATEST or you&#039;ll lie awake forever in bed. Eat prior to ingesting because you won&#039;t eat later. It&#039;s great, try it!""",1
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I am prescribed Xanax 0.5 mg twice daily. At 21 yrs old and have a speech impairment due to major anxiety. Xanax helps greatly to calm me down and be able to control my nervousness. I&#039;ve tried Vistaril, Buspar, Seroquel, Paxil and nothing comes close to working as well as Xanax does! It works pretty fast when real anxious and makes me to be much much more outgoing and motivated throughout the day. I&#039;m taking 40mg Celexa with Xanax which is a wonderful combination. I&#039;m very fidigity and uncalm, but with Xanax, I feel how I should be. While being less anxious and more outgoing, I also feel a very floaty state of mind. Xanax helps!""",7
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Valium every day for 5 years for anxiety and muscle spasms. Good to kill 2 birds with one stone.

I take a relatively microscopic dose of 2.5mg/day, and after 5 years, I have probably built up a tolerance to it so that this tiny dose has no physiological effect any more. But even if I&#039;m now getting the placebo effect from it, I don&#039;t care. I don&#039;t have panic attacks any more and that&#039;s all I really care about.""",7
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have just started taking this medicine. I just took my third dose about 30 minutes ago. The first night taking the medicine was difficult. Bad taste - definitely. My legs were fidgety and I tossed and turned for about 4 hours (very unusual for me, I normally sleep like a rock). I could hardly get out of bed for more than 10 minutes the first day. Dizziness was very bad. I took the second dose about 16 hours after the first dose (4pm on day 2). The 2nd day has been a bit better. I was able to get on the exercise bike for a few minutes even. This is my third day. I took the third dose at 8:30 am. I am working up to taking 5mg every 12 hours, but am not there yet. I have a follow-up with the doctor in a couple days. """,6
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""For the past 3 years I&#039;ve suffered from increasingly bad Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I also had mild OCD, by the end of the third year I was having regular panic attacks.  I tried accupuncture, CBT, herbs, supplements and Lorazepam (I took about 5 pills over a year)  but nothing worked. I was completely against taking anti-depressants until I just couldn&#039;t get out of bed for a week. 

I  was prescribed Cipralex. I take 5mg a day.  The change is amazing. I feel like my old self again. The tightness in my chest is gone. I do still get anxiety in the morning and especially on Mondays but I hear that will subside as the drug regulates in my system. I feel like I can handle my stresses again. I&#039;m still doing CBT to work on stress.""",7
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m a 39 y/o female who experienced increased anxiety and finally anxiety attacks at night due to a series of health issues I was dealing with. After other treatments and trying to get off Klonopin I decided to try an SSRI. I started with 2.5 mg of escitalopram with immediate results of reduced anxiety. The next day I bumped it up to 5mg and then began experiencing terrible back pain from neck to hips and sciatica. I tried to stay on for a week but gave up and I am trying Zoloft now. Lexapro was very effective for my anxiety and panic. I did have 2-3 nights of bad insomnia that first week of Lexapro but it started to improve. I would be on it if not for back pain.""",7
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I&#039;m 21. My starting weight was 165. For my height, which is 5&#039;1, I&#039;m considered obese. I have been taking phentermine since 04/29/2016, which is 4 days. I have already lost 5 pounds!! I eat small portions, I started drinking nothing but water, and I started walking/running 2-3 times a day. I walk/run first thing in the morning after I eat, again when my daughter takes her 3 hour nap, and once later on in the afternoon when it&#039;s cooler outside and I can take my daughter in her stroller. So far I&#039;m beyond excited because I may (or may not) reach my goal weight in only one month, or maybe two months. My goal weight is 125-130.""",2
Liletta,Birth Control,"""I have had Liletta for over a year, and have had zero complaints. I no longer get a period (they went away around month 11.) I have no pain or discomfort from it, though I did the first 4-5 days after insertion. It has prevented me from pregnancy, it has not made me gain weight or have any other negative affects. My breasts aren&#039;t tender because of the hormones, no mood swings, no acne. None of the common complaints of the pill, this is 1000000 times than the Depo Prevera Shot, which I HATED. Don&#039;t ever get the shot done, trust me, it&#039;s God awful. Liletta definitely beats the pill, too. I will be getting this reinserted after my next pregnancy.""",8
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I have been on lexapro for a week and it&#039;s been a ride. I have had horrible side effects from the start. Really bad headaches, night sweats, frequent suicidal thoughts. It has had an opposite effect on me. My depression/anxiety are worse. I sleep way too much. I also have experienced loss of appetite while a lot of people gain weight. I&#039;ve lost 9 pounds in a week, which is really weird because my weight has been the same for years. I never really gain or lose so I know it&#039;s the medicines. I&#039;m hoping that all the bad side effects will pass. I don&#039;t want to give up on the drug yet. I&#039;m going to at least try and stick it out for a month.""",5
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I was on Cymbalta for up to just under two weeks ago. At one point, I was on 90mg for a short period of time. Last December, I dropped it. Only because it, meaning Cymbalta, left me mostly feeling fatigued. The anxiety came back and last month, April/2011 restarted it again back on 60mg. Everything was going fairly well, then I experienced a rash on my forehead, itching. My throat felt as if it was closing up on me. Stopped it cold turkey and went through a roller coaster of mostly aggressive moods. It was an allergic/adverse reaction.""",7
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""My PCP prescribed this after long term use of Paroxetine was not helping all of the time. I get panic attacks often. Vomiting, pacing, crying, and hyperventilating. Ugly stuff. She prescribed Clonazepam 0.5mg as needed. I was afraid to take it, I have an addictive personality and my siblings have abused benzos in the past. However, I truly take it as needed! I split all of the pills in half. If I take one half before I do something that I know usually triggers an attack, I&#039;m good to go but I&#039;m not usually THAT lucky. If I feel an attack  coming on, I take one half. I usually wait 15-30 minutes and take the second half ONLY IF NEEDED. 

I have come to find that this has been the best thing for my anxiety in conjunction with the Paroxetine.""",7
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda in April 2016.  I immediately noticed that I had no craving for food.  I felt full quicker and ate less.  Total weight loss 36 pounds.  I was paying out of pocket and stopped after 5 months.  While taking it I felt great, with relief from other physical issues I had. Within 2 weeks of stopping Saxenda my appetite was returning and the food cravings were back.   I am aware of the fact that I have to manage my diet.  This is a great drug, but unless it can be taken on a regular basis, it&#039;s temporary.  Since stopping I am up 4 pounds.""",2
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I have used all known sleepers and other off label medicines for sleepers and I have taken Silenor 6 mg for 3 nights.  It is amazing.  I fall asleep with no problems and stay asleep for 7-8 hours.  No hang over or other side effects.  I had been taking Remeron 60mg for sleep, as it was the best of all I had tried. I thought the Remeron was doing an okay job until I tried the Silenor.  I am thrilled and feel more rested then I have in years.""",0
Voltaren Gel,Pain,"""I was prescribed Voltaren Gel for the arthritis in my hands and bursitis in my elbows.  I also have severe pain down the IT band area in both legs and my hips and low back give me problems (DDD in low back).  Since using Voltaren Gel I can make it through the day without the aching and usually debilitating pain that I get when I don&#039;t use it.  Fortunately I only need to use it once a day in the morning and that gets me through until the next day.  This medicine works.  It smells bad at first when you put it on but I can deal with that.""",9
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""Let&#039;s start with the fact that l just cried for 20 minutes bc of the acne this pill has given me. I&#039;ve been on it for exactly 2 weeks and never seen a pimple in my life. Suddenly my entire forhead is covered in pimples. I was put on this pill because I got my period every 5 days and it lasted for 6-11 days. No blood or spotting since l went on the pill which is a miracle for me! But I am still pretty upset about my skin.""",4
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""Dr tried to get me to switch to this from Ambien.  I finally gave in and was given six 15mg samples.  I am on the 5th night, and have fallen asleep 1 time before 2am.  Tonight I took it at 9:30 along with my melatonin ultra and benadryl.  It is now almost 12:30 and I&#039;m wide awake.  I&#039;ll probably get some sleep around 4a.m. like I generally do, but I will wake up feeling awful.  This drug gives me the worst feeling in the morning, like I&#039;m sleepwalking with a migraine.  I&#039;m going back on the Ambien.""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I was unable to get rid of my baby weight after having my 2nd child and heard about saxenda. After much thought I decided to consult my doctor who was not oppose to me trying it. I&#039;ve been on saxenda now for almost 2 months. I havent experienced any side effects I started with .06 and now on dose 3.0. After one full month  I weighed myself and I&#039;ve lost 10lbs. I&#039;ve decided to weigh myself monthly so I will check in a few weeks my process! Oh and my insurance has picked it up but only for a limited time I have 2 more refills left!""",2
Topamax,Obesity,"""I have been battling my weight since I was pregnant with my first son, who just turned 2.  I was 165 when I got pregnant with him, and on the day I went in to have my second son (who is 5 months old today) I weighed 270. I just took my first 25 mg dose of Topamax last night.  I am addicted to Diet Dr. Pepper and can&#039;t even stand the taste.  Not hungry either, so I&#039;m hopeful that this medicine will work.  I also take Celexa and Tenuate. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the combination, or just the Topamax, but I am feeling kind of &quot;floaty&quot; today, in a sense.  Maybe this will improve with time.""",2
OxyContin,Pain,"""I have suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years. I have been through all the NSAID drugs, Celebrex , etc, Methotrexate injections, gold shots, Aspirin in mega doses. I finally found a Doctor who understood. He prescribed oxycontin 40mg 3 times a day for my pain. I still have pain, but it is liveable. I am on disability, and am also able to hold a part-time job. I don&#039;t struggle to do simple things like take a shower or do the dishes. This medicine has changed my life.""",9
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Belviq for 2 months now. So far, I&#039;ve lost 17 pounds. I started at 240. I am in my late 30&#039;s and have struggled with being overweight since I started working in the corporate world. I&#039;ve noticed that I don&#039;t have the late night cravings that I used to have and I feel full after dinner up until the next morning. I used have the need to snack before bed, but that has gone away since I&#039;ve been on Belivq. No side effects expect a dry mouth the first week or so. I also used to drink a six pack of beer on the weekends but I&#039;ve noticed that I don&#039;t feel the urge to binge drink anymore.... and I feel great!""",3
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been using Ambien (10mg) for about 2 months and it works great. I suggest going straight to bed after taking it. Also, give yourself 7-8 hours of time to sleep. Ambien knocks me out in 15 minutes and I sleep about 9 hours. Feel great when I wake up. I can&#039;t turn my mind off when I go to bed so it has been a big help. I&#039;m 54 and this is the 1st medicine I&#039;ve taken on a regular basis so I was nervous about taking Ambien at first. It has been great.""",0
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed Prozac for clinical depression, the unfortunate side effect of Prozac is insomnia. So I was prescribe Trazodone. 

The awesome: I fall asleep within 20 min of taking it. 25mg = 4 hrs sleep, 50mg = 8 hrs sleep. If I have a potty break in the middle of the night I can fall back to sleep in short order. 

The not-awesome: I feel like I&#039;m slightly drunk/high/off the next day. I mean I guess that&#039;s awesome if you don&#039;t have a job that requires critical thinking in a B2B environment, but since I do, I can&#039;t continue to take it &amp; function at the level I need to at work.""",0
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I got Implanon inserted a month and a day ago and I couldn&#039;t be more excited!  I was a little nervous as I&#039;ve never been on a progestin only birth control method (always been on combination hormones), but so far, so great!  The procedure was super easy.  I did have a bruise that lasted about 2-3 weeks and my period that I had when I got it implanted lasted about 2 weeks as well (which made me nervous I was going to be a constant bleeder on this!), but since then, nothing!  It looks like I will be one of the lucky few to not have any bleeding on this birth control method.  But, even if I do, the idea of not having to think about birth control for 3 years (I always forgot pills), is so exciting to me, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll care!""",8
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I was on the pill (Yaz) for 3 years and it wasn&#039;t too bad but I am terrible at remembering to take it so I decided to switch to something more permanent for a while and I&#039;m glad I went with Implanon. My period faded away within 2 months and I haven&#039;t got it since. Also, no mood swings or morning sickness like I used to get with the pill. My first month with it I lost 13 pounds. My metabolism has sped up and it&#039;s harder to gain weight so that was nice too.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""Started 7/9/16, it&#039;s morning of 7/18. So far I have lost 11lbs. Just recently started week 2 and I&#039;m feeling the sleepiness and nausea it&#039;s not horrific, concerned I might have to go to 1 pill again but for 11lbs in 9 days I&#039;ll try to stick it out. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s all in my head but my cravings have pretty much gone and my portions are incredibly small and I&#039;m really not hungry at all any more. I&#039;ve also been more interested in walking which before hand if someone even mentioned they were going for a walk I would want to throw up- I&#039;ve even started to add 5-10 push-ups after my daily walk. Super thirsty all the time but I haven&#039;t retained any of the water and I try to mix it up- put some lemons or cucumbers in the water for added boost""",2
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""My first day taking it, it made me so angry I would pace around and cry. I had to be moving CONSTANTLY. My insides felt like they were churning, like I had to burst out of my skin. I couldn&#039;t sleep either, it was hard to sit and watch TV, read, or play video games, or even to stand still in the shower. Essentially, I was up pacing around for about 20 hours a day. I have never had such an experience before.""",6
Morphine,Pain,"""My doctor started me on the 15mg of MsContin last month 3x/day and it isn&#039;t doing a very good job of controlling my congenital stenosis, spondylosis, scoliosis, or bulging pain...Will be requesting the 60mg Oramorph 3x/day on my next visit as I was diagnosed for dental problems I had for 5 years.  It works great with MSIR 30mg for any breakthrough pains. Just be sure to inform your doctor if you have been taking any opioid medications before as that will determine your correct starting dose.""",9
Adderall,ADHD,"""I always knew I was different from everyone else. I was very quiet and shy. But in my mind I couldn&#039;t shut up. My mind was loud. In class I could never stop fidgeting, playing with my hair, scratching an itch, doodling on notebooks. I wondered why nobody else squirmed around like me. At 24 I was diagnosed with ADD. Adderall is life changing. I&#039;m finally normal. I feel like everyone else. My mind is at ease. I am in charge of my thoughts. I can have genuine conversations with people without my mind wondering. I am finally happy after years of struggles. I am organized and more peaceful. """,1
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""As one of the reviewers who posted feeling &quot;different&quot; on day 1 or 2 on Pristiq, I am now on it for 10 days and I have been very tired up until today.  From day 2-8, I slept a good 12 hours daily which is hard to do with kids lol!  But today I woke up feeling good and immediately made beds, put on coffee and whipped up a great breakfast.  This may not seem like &quot;a big deal&quot; but for me, who was lying in bed crying for 8 or so weeks, it&#039;s a huge change and I hope it continues. 

I have been waking up frequently at night but it&#039;s not that bad as I can fall back to sleep easily.  As I said in another post, I was on another antidepressant for almost a year and it was horrible.  The hardest part was saying yes to the help offered.  Good luck to all.""",5
Trazodone,Depression,"""I started out on a quarter of a 50 mg Trazadone tablet every other night at bedtime.  I did this for a week then increased to a quarter tab every night.  After two nights of one quarter tablets I started waking with a stuffy nose and a headache.   Morning 3, I was in a full blown migraine and had to take zomig.  I have attempted this exact process 4 times now with weeks in between (no trazadone) to make sure it is a side effect of the medicine. Now, I am sure Trazadone is causing the headaches and I never have taken more than 1/4.""",5
Acanya,Acne,"""I&#039;ve always been hesitant to use acne medication in the morning because I felt like it would do nothing for me. Also I have to wear makeup before I leave the house so the only thing I usually have underneath my foundation is a moisturizer. I&#039;ve added Acanya to my regime for the past week or so and my face has improved almost instantly. My pores look smaller and I haven&#039;t gotten any new bumps and the ones I already have are going away. I say stick to this product even if you don&#039;t see improvements at first! Hopefully I&#039;ll see more improvements""",4
Topamax,Obesity,"""I was on 25 mg to start and ended up taking 100. I lost weight. But the price I paid in side effects was not worth it.

I lost so much hair that when I try to braid it it&#039;s like braiding tiny strands of dental floss. It looks so ridiculous long I had to chop it all off just to conceal how grossly thin it is.

People call it dopamax for a reason. It made my memory Swiss cheese and when I had to process information it felt like fighting through seaweed.

The worst side effect was the depression. This stuff makes me downright suicidal. 

It helped me lose about 80 pounds by starvation. I never wanted to eat. I became anemic. If you&#039;ve never had that before you&#039;ll find simple physical tasks to feel like they&#039;re inciting heart attacks.""",2
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have to say this is a great medicine for people to try especially if those having difficulty sleeping.  I had mania and my highs and lows have become stable.  I have been taking this for about a month and noticed a difference the next day.  It does have an awful taste but it is worth the benefits.  My cocktail currently for Bipolar 1 is Effexor XR, Depakote, Lamictal, and Saphris.  I plan to ween off some of these medicines since Saphris has been working well.  I have tried Abilify and Seroquel and had bad reactions.""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Took for two months, 1 Capsule a day for my ADD. I have tried most ADHD medicines, stimulant and non- stimulant types. I was expecting a &#039;non event&#039; transition, from adderall, to 
Dexedrine predominant Vyvanse. I have used Dexedrine and found it helpful with focus and follow through issues, with minimal side effects. Vyvanse did not turn out to be what I&#039;d hoped for. Minimal fuss, and a stable continuation of living and treating my ADD. Vyvanse
Had no similarities to Dexedrine . Felt sad, bad, and disconnected from being in the moment.
Side effects did not disappear during course of treatment. Somehow a perfectly acceptable 
Drug ingredient, Dexedrine, became Lisdexamphetamine. The long acting formulation benefit is lost, to a imposter drug""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have started Contrave off and on for over 8 months now. When I was taking it both morning and evening a did notice the weight loss. My body seemed to just release whatever I ate via bowel movements. I was losing weight. It is hard in the beginning letting the meds get into your system, the dizziness, headaches, moodiness and nauseous feelings did occur with me. I just started back again yesterday. Although it is effective, getting passed the side effects is why I keep stopping.""",2
Differin,Acne,"""I have been using this product since it was made available without a prescription. 

If you are going to use it, be sure to read the instructions and warnings. 

This product has a period of time at the beginning of use that makes your acne worse and then clears it. I went through this process when I started taking Spironolactone, so I knew what to expect and I trusted that it would go away - it did. 

My skin looks and feels fantastic! I still get an occasional zit here at there - I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s my fault as I&#039;m a toucher/picker/popper. 

This is an easy product to add to your routine. Make sure to use it at night and wash off in the morning so you don&#039;t have to worry about sunburns. 

I highly recommend Differin.""",4
Adderall,ADHD,"""I have ran the gauntlet of ADD meds, starting with Concerta then tried Vyvance which worked well in the beginning,  then my Dr switched to Adderall XR,  then to I R, which works best for me I take 20mg twice a day definitely helps with non stop thinking,  racing thoughts,  and just simply getting motivated.  I have been on the IR for about a year and the highs are finally outweighing the lows. 39 years old and can see light at the end of the tunnel.""",1
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""After being on seroquel and then shortly zyprexa I was put on latuda 40 mg. It gave me a lot of anxiety and strong restless feelings so I dropped to 20 mg and it helped. I&#039;ve since gone back up to 40 mg because 20 wasn&#039;t helping all my symptoms. It helps a lot with suicidal thoughts and negative obsessive thoughts and I&#039;ve noticed I&#039;ve lost weight on it. The anxiety can be kinda unbearable at times but in the overall scheme it seems to be worth it. I would go up to a higher dose but my insurance won&#039;t cover it. I take it at night with something to eat and if I do have uncomfortable feelings they go away within a couple hours. Overall I would say it&#039;s a pretty good med but be careful because it is pretty potent even at low doses.""",6
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Well, I am back for my one month results. Starting weight 6/20/17 - 324. Today&#039;s weight -297. That&#039;s right!!! 27 lbs!!!. I have started to watch my calorie intake, I walk 3 -4 days with my kids, then the other days I am at the gym doing cardio and toning. I stopped drinking pop. I am up to a gallon and half of water a day. I cut the carbs way back. I have tons of energy, I feel great and everyone tells me that they see so much of a change in my appearance. 
I would recommend this to anyone, as long as you are looking for a lifestyle change. Not just a quick weight loss. (I have had friends who took it for fast weight loss, lost half the weight I have and gained it all back when they stopped)! This is meant to help with changing your life.""",2
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been titrating up on Buspar after going off of Xanax last year and then starting up with 5mg fluoxetine and 10mg doxepin. So far, this is working far more gently than the xanax. I don&#039;t have a zap of relief following by impending panic attacks within hours. I am much more level. I am having side effects of nausea, dizziness, and light-headedness for a few days after each increase in dosage. I&#039;m up to 20mg 3x a day and I&#039;m supposed to sit tight here so I&#039;m hoping to be done with the side effects soon and get into a stable state. I had a ton of problems with withdrawal from the benzos so I don&#039;t want to go back to them; buspirone has been a great alternative so far. My anxiety is so bad that I&#039;d rather be dizzy and nauseated than anxious""",7
Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I currently take 300 mg of carbamazepine a day. 100mg in morning and 200mg at night. Which is hard for me to remember the different doses because this medication causes me to forget everything. I also had really bad nausea and hot flashes when I first started taking it.  I quit smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol on this drug. Super amazing accomplishments, but on the other hand I have lost three jobs in six months. Before tegretol I was taking 300mg of seroquel XR a day and it made me a completely unemotional zombie. So It&#039;s hard for me to control myself sometimes because I&#039;m feeling all these things I haven&#039;t felt before . I hope tegretol can work for me though and be my miracle drug, because changing meds is my living nightmare.""",6
Concerta,ADHD,"""Was on Concerta xl for 7 days and had to come off it due to the unbearable side effects of the drug. I  was diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive sub type) generalised anxiety and depression. This drug made me feel very nauseous, gave me a headache, made me shake, gave me twitches throughout my body, messed my brain up in terms of cognition etc, made me very aware of my heartbeat, made me extremely anxious to the point of not being able to leave my room or communicate with anyone and just generally messed me up. At one point i was doing some stretching on a yoga mat to try and calm myself down and i felt so confused that i didn&#039;t know what to do with my legs. This drug wasn&#039;t for me and caused an unpleasant experience.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""SW: 260, CW: 205, GW: 160
My doctor prescribed phentermine on May 15, 2017. I have been taking half of a 37.5 mg pill in the morning and half in the afternoon. That coupled with daily exercise and a 1,400 calorie diet has resulted in a 55 lb weight loss in 4-ish months!
There are side effects: nervousness, elevated heart rate, dry mouth, and constipation. However, these can be handled via your healthy lifestyle! Drinking about 4 liters of water a day solves the dry mouth and some of the nervousness (just always carry a water-bottle with you). For the constipation, I just take fiber gummies twice a day, and it does the trick!
This has been an amazing health journey! If I can do it, you can too!! Keep working hard!""",3
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am 16 years old. I have been to over 20 in and outpaient mental health hospitals, including residential. I had severe depression, severe anxiety, and the last year before I was diagnosed, extreme anger. I was suicidal, homicidal, I self harmed, I had an eating disorder, I dealt with death, abuse, bullying, everything. I attempted suicide four times. I barely made it each time. I had all the symptoms. low self-esteem, self harm, eating disorders, isolation, mania, the suicidal/homicidal thoughts, I was trying to use drugs, I skipped school, I tried to kill people, I had insomnia. I finally, after two years, found this miracle little pill. """,6
Ketorolac,Pain,"""Toradol has literally been a lifesaver! I have Cervical Dystonia, which gives me really bad migraines. Toradol usually will take my entire migraine away, and if it doesn&#039;t, it makes it manageable.It doesn&#039;t make me sick to my stomach, and it doesn&#039;t make me too drowsy, I&#039;m able to drive home afterwards. The only bad thing about it is that I usually have pain around the injection site that lasts for a long while, but it hardly compares to the pain of the headache I had before it!""",9
Desyrel,Insomnia,"""I was taking regular Trazodone on and off for a couple of years, it stopped working so my doctor switched me to Desyrel. It&#039;s a good pill for the fact that it does make you tired, but I&#039;d make sure you&#039;re gonna get 8 or more hours of sleep before you take it. I was prescribed 100mg pills, and I only took half of a pill whenever I took it, and I had the hardest time waking up the next day. Also, with the reg Trazodone and with Desyrel, it took a long time for it to kick in for me (2  hours), but that might be because I have a high tolerance to pills. If you&#039;re new to this medicine, take it on the weekend, or whenever you can sleep in, so you can see how it works.""",0
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I asked on this site about my taking 300 mg lamictal for 2 weeks after titrating up and not seeing consistent results. A couple of you suggested I split the dosage and take twice a day. Well, good news! After a couple of days, I started feeling consistently better. If anyone is going through what I was, I recommend you talk to your doctor about dividing the dose. Thanks for all your help. I am getting my life back so I want to help others!""",6
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I have been on phend for 5 weeks and my Dr put me on b12 shot every week also and I have lost 16 lb so far am so happy with it no side effect at all except dry mouth. I feel thirsty all the time and this is a good thing :&#039;) my energy level is so good I use to wight 162 and now am 146.  I was reading about the med and start to get worried about withdrawal after taking it I still have 15 lbs to lose so if any one can ensure me or tell me what was his/her experience please. Thank u""",2
Bupropion,Depression,"""I have situational depression, never dealt with it before. Wellbutrin had definitely helped get me out of bed each day. The &quot;situation&quot; is becoming better as well but I find my emotions aren&#039;t as out of whack. I cry less &amp; get angry less. I do feel it made me more anxious which I&#039;m already dealing with &amp; taking Buspirone for. I didn&#039;t experience many side effects BUT one that is hard to deal with but because it seems to make me get through each day a little better, I deal with it. It makes my throat feel closed, which is very annoying. I feel often like I can&#039;t breathe well &amp; that I can&#039;t swallow or that something is stuck in my throat. I&#039;ve not taken any other pills on several days to determine that it was the Wellbutrin that did it &amp; it is.""",5
Tramadol,Pain,"""Hi , I take Tramadol every 8 hours 50 Mg.  I have Factor 5 mutation a blood clotting disorder. Both my legs are filled with chronic blood clots threw my groin and I also suffered PE. in December. I  was going to my Pain Dr for 2 years telling him it&#039;s not working for me. All he seemed to do was tell me he was not going to put me on anything else... So I gave up and feel left out like the trash my my Medical Dr. I did every nerve test and they came out fine, I went to at least 10 different Drs not just for my pain but my &quot; Green Fitler &quot; as well and Blood Drs and so forth .. to be told that the nerve test  they gave me wont show this type of nerve pain I am in agonoy 24]7 I cry my self to sleep most nights and suffer greatly .""",9
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started this medicine not too long ago and love it. I have been on many other medicines over the years without good results. The one thing I would like to say to others who have written comments here is, do not say you would not recommend this to someone because it doesn&#039;t work for you. That is the reason there are different medications, and just because it doesn&#039;t work for you, it is ridiculous for you to say you wouldn&#039;t recommend others take it.""",6
Minocycline,Acne,"""I am over 40 with adult acne for years. I had it under control with epidue for years but something hormonal happened and I had a severe break out and it was bad. My dermatologist started me solodyn 105mg. It worked immediately. My acne cleared up and my face was smooth again. But my only side affect is I have gotten really dark, I haven&#039;t read anyone complaints about getting dark so I would  like some responses to my post. I don&#039;t know if its because I am a black woman.  But after reading some of the posts I will start taking a lesser dose to see if that helps.""",4
Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorde,"""Psychiatric nurse decided to change antidepressant (trazodone).  Caused psychotic episode.  Hospitalized and psychiatrist decided not to put me back on antidepressant (Lexapro) that I was taking before trazodone.  Bad move.  They put me on gabapentin for several months.  Angry most of the time.  Irritable.  Unhappy.  Finally getting off gabapentin.  Didn&#039;t help mood (made it worse), didn&#039;t help anxiety (I had to take more Ativan).  The use of gabapentin was off label and a very bad idea.  """,6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am 39 years old and I have been trying to flatten my stomach ever since I had my last child 15 years ago.  I will admit I do love food!  I heard about using Phentermine from a friend of mine, and I thought to myself, wow this might actually be what I am looking for!  So I made a doctors appointment and she gave me a script for this on June 6th 2014 and I got it filled and started right away, I was told to start out using only half, so I did and didn&#039;t feel that it was working using only half so the next day I started taking 1 whole pill.  I can say that it was all good, and to date I have not had any side effects.  When I started using this medication I weighed a wooping 186!! and today 7/23/14 I am at 168, &amp; want to be about 140.""",3
Adapalene,Acne,"""I definitely recommend Adapalene Gel. I have had acne for the past 3-5 years. I am 29.  I never had acne like this before this time period. I was skeptical at first but now I can leave the house without trying to unsuccessfully cover my redness, scarring, and pimples. The scarring is still there but it is faint. There are only 2 small negatives I experienced while taking it ...1. When my face sweats (wearing a hat, being in a hot room, or working out) it just burns badly. 2. When I started it my face felt like it was on fire a lot.  Initially. I switched to every other day when using it. Now I use it before bed w CeraVe  moisturizer. I only use 1 PEA size for my entire face.  Don&#039;t over do it.  It&#039;ll help you just need to be patient. :)""",4
Percocet,Pain,"""For nerve injury I was taking Lyrica and Vicodin - the only combination that helped (after much trial and error). Then I had ended up with surgery (ovary removal) and Dr prescribed Percocet 5-325. It is a wonder medicine. The first day slightly nauseous, but that quickly went away. I now prefer the Percocet; doesn&#039;t make me as sleepy as Vicodin. I break pills in half, spreading it throughout the day to just dial down the pain enough for me to be cheerful and productive but not zoned out. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because it does cause constipation (take Colace OTC).""",9
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have bipolar 2. Lamotrigene 400mg of lamotrigene has taken away anger and irritability. I was still crying over everything so my psychitrist put me on latuda 20 mg for 1 month. First week projectile vomiting every other day for a week. Saw no benefit. I was bumped to 40. Immediately I felt semi anxious. Day 5 almost had a panic attack out of the blue. This med is not right for me. It really scared me how anxious and panicky I became on 40 mg. I am stopping after I call my doctor.""",6
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""In response to Natalie- why didn&#039;t your doctor wean you off this medication? By just  cutting your dose by half-if that&#039;s what he/she did here,  no wonder you&#039;re experiencing such horrific side effects - speak up! My daughter just started taking this for panic disorder brought about by MIf the RX only comes in capsule form at those two doses- then there needs to be advocacy to change this so there is a way to wean off this med! So many people report negative side effects- withdrawal shouldn&#039;t be torture and you might need to find a more compassionate doctor- it astonishes me the lack of empathy some professionals have- considering their career choice- if they can&#039;t be compassionate, they should stay AWAY from patients and stick to reearch!""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking Ambien for almost a month now and I have to say, it is amazing. The first night I took it, it kicked in about 10 minutes later. I have never had such a good nights sleep. I woke up feeling energized and I had energy all day. The only weird thing that I experienced were MILD hallucinations before I actually fell asleep. I sat down on the bed and apparently asked my husband &quot;when did we get a water bed?&quot; (we don&#039;t have a water bed). And also I asked him, &quot;when did we get pink and green sheets?&quot; (Our sheets are white). Other than that, nothing scary or frightening. I didn&#039;t get up in the middle of the night doing anything weird. When I did get up to use the restroom, I knew I was awake and I knew what I was doing.""",0
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been taking Belviq for 1 week, I haven&#039;t lost any weight yet. I do believe it&#039;s helping me not crave sweets! I have a major sweet tooth &amp; after 1 day on Belviq I have had no cravings for the sweets. I do have dry mouth so drinking a lot of water which is a +! Also I&#039;m very tired, it&#039;s all I can do to get through work. Hoping I start to feel better, I can&#039;t take much more of this tiredness. I hope I start seeing the scale go down.""",3
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""You guys seriously need to stop making people anxious about the weight gain. If you don&#039;t eat you WON&#039;T get fat. I&#039;ve been on seroquel since one and a half month and had no side effects except at first a little. When i started taking it i was checking every inch of my body on a daily basis, acting so paranoid cause of your reviews, thinking that it has some kind of a magic spell in getting people fat. I workout almost every day since I have an Endomorph kind of a body which is the worse kind. (Bad metabolism, hard to lose weight and maintaining it..). Been taking it cause i was having some very minor panic attacks, due to some stressful past events I experienced, which were preventing me from sleep All night. I take 12.5mg most of the time.""",0
Tapentadol,Pain,"""Awesome drug with no narcotic hangover. With radiation damage to all the organs that I still have, the pain never goes away. Nucynta (600mg/day has allowed me to have a tolerable life and work much better. Best medicine since vioxx (which was removed from market). My pain level is down to a 6 or 7 now. Very pleased. Much better than traditional opioids that cause highness, mental and go problems. Clear headed on this med.""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;m a 52 year old woman. Started Contrave , July 19. Today is January 16. I&#039;ve lost a total of 26 pounds! I monitor my diet. 3 small meals, healthy snacks. I do everything right! Exercise EVERY day, minimum of 1/2 hour on a stationary bike (at moderate speed)   My Dr. Is happy with my loss, but I&#039;m NOT. People loosing 10 a month??? And I can&#039;t lose more than 30 in 6 ?????? I&#039;m about to give up! I think I could lose an equivalent amount without Contrave!""",2
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I couldn&#039;t really tell whether it worked or not for Bipolar 1 Disorder.  I was on a few different medications at once:  Lamictal, Lorazepam (as needed), and for a brief time, Seroquel with the Abilify.  The dose was 5 mg since I was experiencing a mixed episode with some paranoid thoughts.  I didn&#039;t notice it being particularly helpful for depression.  Maybe there was some slight mood stabilization, but not enough for me to really feel relief.  I was taken off of it for this reason.  Also, even at 5 mg, it caused me some restlessness and a sensation similar to a headache.  It&#039;s expensive too.""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have taken Ambien CR on a nightly basis for nearly two years now and have found that it is truly helpful. I have found that after a year or so on a 6.25 mg dosage I had to go up to 12.5 mg in order to achieve the same result. Other than developing a tolerance to it however, I have found that Ambien CR is extremely effective. I am able to fall asleep easily and my sleep is a very peaceful one that leaves me feeling well rested in the morning.""",0
Ultram,Pain,"""I have been taking Ultram (brand) for 7 years for the management of chronic neuropathy pain in my arms, legs, hands, and feet, and I wouldn&#039;t change it for anything.  Non-addictive, effective 90% of the time, it&#039;s a rare day when the pain exceeds the drug&#039;s ability to control it. Yes, there is some occasional residual background discomfort; with chronic pain that&#039;s to be expected.  However, as long as I can function normally without a lot of adverse side effects and addiction, I&#039;m a happy camper.  Please note this is for the brand Ultram. I had serious issues with the generic (with the fillers, I think), and do not recommend generic at all.""",9
Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorde,"""Great for &quot;resetting&quot; at bedtime when feeling a little upswing with Bipolar.  I have noticed after a day of being a little up, the Klonopin drops the intensity and brain energy nicely to allow for rest and relaxing.  I do notice that if I don&#039;t take it, because I may not feel like I need it one night, that it is harder to get to sleep.  I also have experienced some short term memory loss when taking 1.5 mg (3 x .5 mg) the next day.  It has also helped me with anxiety when depressed.  Great drug!""",6
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""So there&#039;s many opinions out there about the Nexplanon/Implanon. When reading everything, always know that ALL BIRTH CONTROL AFFECTS EVERYONE VERY DIFFERENTLY- not 1 person will be affected the same way. I had the implant placed February 2014 and got it removed July 2015- a year and a half. I loved it- at first, I had regular periods and then about 4 months in they would come every now and then but be very light so it was not a problem. At about a year, I stopped having periods altogether... but I also lost my sex drive completely. Being married, it is a very big issue to not have a sex drive. I did gain a little bit of weight, but nothing too crazy. I got it removed before the 3 year mark MAINLY because of my loss of sex drive.""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro for a week now to help me keep mellow like jello. I&#039;m not taking anything else. I work 3rd shift. So my nights are days.

I fell asleep in recliner from 8:00am to 1:00pm got up ate a bite. Went to bed. I woke up to go to the bathroom a few times. But didn&#039;t get out of bed till 11:00pm Saturday.

I have been on the pill on and off for 3 weeks. This pill is a great help when I work morning shifts. I have changed my diet a lot so I&#039;m not sure if its the pill or just the change in diet thats helping with the weight loss. But I&#039;ll continue doing what I&#039;m doing and hope the pounds still fall off.This pill definitely gives you energy and makes your throat very dry. It doesn&#039;t make me want to drink more water so that&#039;s still a struggle lol.""",3
Duac,Acne,"""I have been using duac $33, as my topical ointment along with doxycilyn $10, for 5 days now. I have suffered from cystic acne for 17 years. I am so so happy with my results so far. I woke up this morning with still a few blemishes left, but all my redness has gone, the &#039;under skin bumps&#039; are all gone, and my skin finally, does not hurt! I have had no side effects as yet. I am having the doxy pill in the morning and using duac at night after my nightly shower. My beauty routine is advance natural cleanser and Dr. Spiller toner and moisturizer. The moisturizer is oil based so it is really hydrating which is counteracting the dryness from duac. Please, do it! Try it! I am so happy. And its cheap.""",4
Liletta,Birth Control,"""Got my Liletta at Planned Parenthood in early December 2016. I&#039;m 22, never been pregnant or had a pap before. 
My doctors were very nice and the procedure wasn&#039;t that bad. They even gave me a heat pack to put on my tummy.
It was uncomfortable and the insertion felt like a really bad cramp for a second or two but nothing I couldn&#039;t handle.

Afterward, I bled constantly for 30+ days, heavy at first but then a medium-light flow. 
After that I didn&#039;t get my period for about 3 months. Then it returned but it&#039;s now VERY light but WAY longer, about 10-14 days when it used to be 5-7. 
During my periods I now don&#039;t have cramps, but a couple of days before I get horribly painful random cramps that last 10-60ish seconds. Still not Prego though.""",8
Adderall,ADHD,"""I have been taking this for 3  months now and I feel we are getting somewhere.  I am taking 15 mg in the morning and 15 mg at 1pm.  I feel I could have the dose increased as I have only one side effect which is dry mouth.  No decreased appetite and no jitters.  I have decreased my coffee in take and am much calmer than I have been in years.  Before I had trouble with focus and gnatting about.  I know we are getting close to where I should be.  I am 44 and have suffered too long and so has my children, boss, friends, etc.""",1
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I started taking this drug 5-6 years ago. At first, it made me really dizzy like I was going to pass out. It still makes me dizzy, but I had really bad insomniac where I would hear people when I was sleeping. Plus, I used to be anorexic. Like I was 60 65 lbs before taking this. I was on 30 mg of this drug and it made me throw up. I have always been tired even before taking this drug, so that doesn&#039;t bother me. I am now on 7.5 mg and it works great except that sometimes I cannot sleep. When I have alcohol on the weekends and at night I take this drug, I sleep really well. Sometimes I still feel dizzy but I do not feel like I could pass out. My hands have always shaked even before taking this pill.""",0
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve only taken Belviq for 3 days but have had wonderful results already! I&#039;ve lost 5 lbs. My doctor started me out slowly taking it only in the mornings for the first 3 days just to ensure my body could tolerate it. Tonight I will also begin to take it in the evenings. I have had a bit of a dry mouth but I don&#039;t mind, I just need to drink more water. I did stop drinking soda, and cut back on some of my calories. Tomorrow I start at my gym, so it will be interesting to see if I lose more weight or gain muscle. I don&#039;t usually tolerate meds very well, so I&#039;m really happy that this seems to be working for me so far. I&#039;ll post another update as I get further along. My insurance doesn&#039;t cover weightloss medicine, but the discount card helps.""",3
Aczone,Acne,"""I am a 44 year old female who after having clear skin my entire life had a sudden breakout of cystic acne.  I was devasted and went to my dermatologist immediately.  She was rather dismissive and put me on acanya and oracea.  This did nothing except make me feel like I had the flu (oracea).  I decided to try a new dermatologist.  My new derm took my immediately off oracia because in her words I don&#039;t have rosacea.  She also took me off a acanya because in her words she would use on maybe a 9 year old!  She started me on aczone and tazarac.  Within 3 days I was completely clear.  Now if I even start to get a cystic pimple it is gone within a day!! It is perfect for cystic hormonal acne:) I am so happy to be clear and confident :)""",4
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""I was switched to Effexor XR after 2 years of Paxil. It worked wonderful for about 3 years. I was on 75mg and started to have uncontrollable movement with my one arm. Talked to my doctor who said it was not the medicine. Well after another year I was having the problem in my legs and both arms and could no longer sit or walk without frequent jerking. My doctor finally realized that it was a rare side effect of the medication from long term use and switched me to another. I still have the jerking at least 2 to 3 times a week. If you notice this problem at all you need to talk to your doctor immediately.""",7
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I was given this medication because of fibromyalgia and insomnia. I was unable to get a deep sleep and as a result my fibromyalgia was very bad. I was not informed of the issues of long term use and have been on it for years. I started with a new doctor and the first thing she did was take me off of this medication down from 1mg to 1/2 for 30 days and then cold turkey. This is way too fast for this medicine. I have had heart palpitations, hallucinations, inability to sleep-at all, lightheaded, high blood pressure, racing pulse, really weird thoughts. """,0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""At my doctor&#039;s visit on May,21 2017 I was told I have a high blood pressue and high cholestrol and weight 171 lbs. I&#039;m only 29yrs old and 5&#039;3&quot;. I then told my doctor that I want to lose weight. She prescribed me phentermine 30mg, which I take Monday to Friday. After 2 weeks, I&#039;m down to 161lb, lost 10 lbs. I&#039;m excited to see my next result.I feel active and full of energy .My mouth gets dry most of the time so I always carry my water bottle with me. The bad thing about it that I noticed is I&#039;m always mad all the time even with just little things.But...this thing works and I love the changes with my weight loss.""",3
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""Beginning month 2 of Zohydro. Cannot believe the negative press! It is a long overdue blessing to chronic pain sufferers. I have multiple back issues and surgeries. The Norco 4x a day was causing about as much issue with my stomach and intestines as helping with pain. Finally asked, is there an option? Pain clinic Dr said good results with Zohydro! As we are adjusting the dosage, I take 5 mg of norco for breakthrough pain, but consider that temporary. Me, my back AND stomach are much better and much more level pain relief.  Thanks again!!!""",9
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 46 y.o. female and have been taking Vyvanse for approximately 3 months. I started out on 50mg in the morning and it worked great by giving me energy and completing projects. However, I would get tired after 8 hours. After 1 month of taking 50mg x1 a day my doctor switched me to 30mg twice daily to prevent that tired feeling after 8 hours. After 2 months of taking 30mg x2 a day I&#039;m tired a lot and seemed to have already built up a resistance to it. Maybe I just need to increase the dose, not sure. This medicine worked great at first for ADHD and I&#039;m hoping I can increase the dose and feel energetic and focused again. The side effects I have experienced are, weight loss (13lbs) the first month but gained 8 lbs back, and have bad breath.""",1
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""The way lamictal works faster or slow is due to your metabolism. I could go up doses very fast without having the rash but wow I suffered so much while going through this process. It does get worse before it gets better. Once you get to the therapeutic dose then things start to improve. Now; some of us have vivid dreams. Scary sometimes but you get used to them. Also it took me at least 5 months until I got its full benefit. And it may cause you insomnia, need some ambien for that. Ambien stopped working after 5 months. And so when I tried melatonin it worked pretty well. Melatonin didn&#039;t work in the first months on this Drug. Only worked after the 5 months and then after few 2 months I didn&#039;t need it anymore. I was sleeping well without it.""",6
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I have been taking buspar for 4 months now and it has helped pretty well for my anxiety. I take 3 10mg a day. I mostly like it because it helps with the extra anxiety and slight depression i get from the come down off of my adderall i take for adhd every day too. The only side effects I&#039;ve had from the buspar has been nausea but as long as i eat a little bit of food whenever i take them it subsides that pretty well so i would recommend it to anyone with the same situation.""",7
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""For the first time I can get to sleep every night.  It usually gives me about 5 hours of sleep, and if I wake up and take about 0.15 Klonopin, I can go back to sleep for another 3 hours.  Feel rested for the first time in years!  I don&#039;t take it until I am absolutely ready to lay down in bed, then lay down and think happy thoughts to carry with me to dream land.  Previously, due to bipolar insomnia,  I would take tons of Nyquil, Benadryl, Sominex, l-tyrosine, melatonin that only gave me a few hours sleep and I&#039;d wake up and take more pills. For years I couldn&#039;t sleep in a bed but would wander through the house at night trying to get comfortable on the floor, etc. as my husband just bumping me would wake me up.  I thank you Ambien!""",0
Duac,Acne,"""The first time I used Duac it was very effective, no irritation or symptoms after using it but a bit dry on affected areas. After a while I stopped using it as my skin was fine, when my acne came back I began to use it again after about two weeks. The morning after applying it my skin came out in large red blotches around affected areas, and it burned, was extremely itchy and it was dry. I have tried to using it now again since a month of not using it again and the same has happened, won&rsquo;t be using this product again.""",4
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""I started taking this medication 1 month ago and have had absolutely no ill effects from it. My first worry was not being able to sleep once I heard the word &quot;stimulant&quot;. Not an early riser I set my alarm clock to go off at 6AM just to take the pill!  Now I am taking it much later and have absolutely no ill effects.  Seem to have more energy, sleep better and starting to get some things accomplished instead of dabbling in two or three different things.""",1

Sha actually enjoys schools , her self esteem grew (she always thought she was not as smart as other kids). I dont know if thats how it will work all the time but so far it has been great ! She has some appettite loss especially during the day but it has been coming back slowly and she started to eat more normal.  She does not take the mediciane on weekends unless she studies. I dont see any other side affects besides loss of appetite.""",1
Vicoprofen,Pain,"""I was born with club feet (both feet turned in and bottoms turned up). Have been prescribed everything from tramadol and Vicodin to Percocet 10mg. I worried about alcohol with anything that had acetominophen so asked Doctor about Vicoprofen.  It&#039;s by far better than anything else I&#039;ve taken.  I dont have problems taking on an empty stomach, drinking, or making bowel movements.  It even does more for the pain than the few oxycodone 30mg I have been given a of couple times.  Part of my condition is a short achilles tendon which makes me suffer from severe inflammation in all parts of my feet (probably why it works so well). Only side effect I have is an occasional pit in stomach when taken on empty stomach and irritability from time to time.""",9
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""My elderly dad was prescribed a low dose of Ativan for anxiety. Within 2 weeks he started having auditory hallucinations and could not sleep because the &quot;walls were talking to him&quot;. After he passed every physical test in an emergency visit to the local ER- from a cat scan to blood work and everything in between, the psychiatrist on duty matter of factly told me that Ativan has been known to cause delirium in elderly patients. """,7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I struggled with such bad acne since I was in middle school. I tried almost every type of over the counter medicine that there was and none of it worked. During my Freshman year of high school, I decided that I needed a cure for my acne because of how terrible it was getting. I went to a dermatologist and he recommend Accutane for about 7 months. After about 3 months, I could not believe that my face was getting clearer! When I was finally done, my skin was clear! I was so excited!! I even recommend Accutane to one of my friends and her face turned out great as well. I took Accutane back in 2009 and I&#039;m now 22 years old and my face still looks fantastic! I highly recommend Accutane to anyone who is struggling with acne, it works!""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had Implanon for a little over a year now and it has both benefits and drawbacks. It hurt really badly having it put in and took several weeks to heal. I can still see it through my skin and there is a scar at the entrance. For the first 9 months I did not get my period and then all of a sudden I have light periods every 3-4 weeks and it&#039;s not on a repetitive schedule. It&#039;s great not having to think about taking a pill everyday but the surprise periods aren&#039;t fun. I haven&#039;t had any mood swings or weight gain but I have had skin reactions. My face and back break out with acne since starting the medicine and the insertion site is still itchy. """,8
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Got it in the beginning of the year. Everything was good for about a month. Then I started bleeding constantly. Haven&#039;t had a break from bleeding for about 2 months now. Spent almost as much money for pads/tampons as I did for the out of pocket money for the implant. Hot and cold flashes are terrible. Still have period cramps. Only thing it&#039;s done good for is preventing pregnancy and it hasn&#039;t made me gain weight. Definitely getting it taken out though just so the bleeding will stop and everything will go back to normal.""",8
Armodafinil,Bipolar Disorde,"""I took Nuvigil for the first time and I found myself less tired and more active than ever. I have severe depression and stay tired a lot. For years, I haven&#039;t been myself as for being active I was an athlete for half my life and I knew what being in shape felt like, but with aging I fell into depression and bipolar. Still too early to say, but Nuvigil made a positive difference for at least one day of my life.""",6
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I have only been on ritalin for a couple days now and the results are great. My concentration and focus has improved, I can get more things done and I feel more motivated and self assured. My social life is better and can keep a conversation going. The downsides for me where fast heart rate which made me feel anxious, a bad headache when I first took it and a decreased in appetite. Overall this is working for me so far and I would say to not abuse this drug, combine it with alcohol or anything else and to eat well before taking medicine. hope this helps""",1
Kariva,Birth Control,"""After reading a lot of negative reviews I was nervous at first to start Kariva. I automatically thought it was going to be bad for me but I have not had one bad thing to say about Kariva. It cleared my skin a couple months after starting it along with preventing pregnancy. Other than that my sex drive, weight, moods and eating habits have all stayed the same. I think it really differs from person to person because I love it.""",8
Clindamycin,Acne,"""As I started college my skin broke out like no other, cystic type and absolutely embarrassing. I was too embarrassed to go out just because my skin was so bad. I always take care of my skin and have a very clean so I had no idea why this was happening. 

I tried retinol and it cleared my skin up some but it wasn&#039;t worth the pain and price. My skin felt like it had chemical burns all the time and was red. 

After being prescribed Clindamycin, my face cleared up in a day. I have no idea how this is possible but I&#039;ve only been using it for the days and my skin feels so soft and acne free. Can&#039;t rave about this enough!!!! 

~I have never written a review for anything before but this product deserved it""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""It definitely kills my appetite. However, I&#039;m dizzy, constipated and have headaches.  I also feel a bit anxious.  I&#039;m having trouble remembering things as well. That&#039;s the worst part.  I&#039;ve been on the medication for 2 months.I&#039;m only eating about 1000 calories a day and have only lost 3 pounds. Granted, I&#039;ve had bronchitis twice during this time and haven&#039;t exercised.  I will give this another month because I have about that much of it left. But if I don&#039;t lose something during that time, I&#039;m done.""",2
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Middle age stinks. In the last 5 years my weight and blood pressure became also uncontrollable. My last doctor visit I weighed in at my heaviest. 201# and being 5&#039;7&quot; was categorised has obese. Plus my blood pressure was sky high. Dangerously high. My doctor told me about Saxenda. Well my insurance company would not cover it. So the doctor&#039;s office called in an RX for Victoza. I started the injections May 3rd. I followed the dosing schedule and increased the dose every 7 days. I continue to take the 1.8mg dose. I have lost 31 pounds since May. My blood pressue is now normal even abit low. I feel like I have my life back.""",3
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I had mild acne for almost 2 years and kept it at bay using over the counter treatments such as face washes and proactive (which didn&#039;t work at all). As I approached the 9th grade my doctor put me on doxycycline to prevent scarring. Even after the first week I saw immediate results! It was truly amazing after 6 weeks. I sometimes have bad stomach pain and peeling skin but it&#039;s really a small price to pay for good skin. Even though I still have mild breakouts and small larger pimples I have another month to go on my prescription. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, IT KEPT ME OFF ACCUTANE.""",4
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""I started my son on guanfacine 1mg at night. He was 7. This is after trying a Prozac/ clonodine mix to treat his ADHD, which I hated because all my kid did was sleep. With the guanfacine, which is the generic for intuniv, he is doing great!! The 1mg at night didn&#039;t work well though. After all the adjustments I made, I ended up giving him a 1 mg in the morning and a 2 mg at night. This combo works great and my kid does not sleep all day. In fact, he hardly naps-he has made friends in school and is doing great!!""",1
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on lamictal for about a month now. I started on 50mg, 2nd week 75mg, and 3rd week 100mg at night. 1st 2 days in on 50 I felt borderline aggressive and very irritable. This evened out on the 3rd day and I began to feel very motivated and able to think clearly. I still experienced a few depressive episodes, but I hope to get onto an antidepressant once my dose is high enough. I&#039;ve began taking 25mg in the AM to slowly move up to 100 in the AM on top of my 100 at night. Since I have, my memory, attention, and anxiety have worsened and other side effects have been sweating, raised heart rate, some trouble sleeping, and slight photo-sensitivity. Most of these have subsided as I adjust so overall it&#039;s best to stick with it for a bit.""",6
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""This drug is so incredibly strong. I was prescribed 25 mg for anxiety. I tried it for the first time tonight and I felt the effects after an hour. It made me feel even more anxious because it was so strong and I was not expecting it to be like this. It feels like a really strong/weird high. I was having a little issues breathing and I was seriously considering going to the ER. If you have bad anxiety I would not recommend this drug. I did however pass out after 3 hours and I had the coolest dream! I just woke up after about 3 hours of sleep, even though the purpose was to keep me asleep. If you do take this drug, I recommend taking it at night because you will pass out and be extremely slow and sluggish.  I&#039;m just happy to be alive!! :)""",7
Remeron,Anxiety,"""After 4 LONG years of &quot;experimenting&quot; with Lexapro, Paxil and benzos on and off with my regular MD, I decided to see a Psychiatrist that&#039;s very popular in my city. I told him my symptoms and that I was also going through Ativan tolerance withdrawal. He prescribed me Remeron and agreed to wean me off the Ativan properly. I don&#039;t know why my regular MD didn&#039;t try this miracle medicine on me! GRR!! This changed me overnight. It has STOPPED my nervous stomach and I&#039;m eating again. I sleep good too. A few side effects would be the flashing lights you see when you close your eyes the 1st night I took it, and restless legs and vivid dreams but those are slowly disappearing. This medicine has helped me drastically.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I was on this for about 3 months. It wasn&#039;t bad, I had no spotting. The only reason I went off of it is because I am used to the pill. And on the pill you knew exactly when you would start your period. This one made me clueless since I don&#039;t keep track of it. BUT when I did have my period, I had no cramps or back pain, it was astonishing. It was light too. It was like I wasn&#039;t on my period at all. I did experience very mild cramps at the very end 1-2 out of 10 pain wise. If you don&#039;t like the idea of taking a pill &amp; are new to birth control my advice is try it. It&#039;s the closest experience you&#039;ll get of having a regular period (Keeping track of it).""",8
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I weighed 207 when i started. I took it for about a month. I lost 13 lbs. I was never hungry. Just took my large food cravings right away. But it took my short term memory right with i.  It was kinda  scarey. I had to stop taking it . I could not work safely because i was just too forgetful while taking this. The weight came back faster than it came off And gained even more weight. But I ate like I did before taking this drug soon as i stopped taking it.""",3
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I thought Belviq was the answer to my prayers.  I was on it for a week everything was going great other than a headache the first few days and then boom urinary tract infection. So I got some antibiotics, stopped the Belviq to fully have time to heal.  I restarted the Belviq several days later and again urinary issues severe ones such as bladder leakage, burning, pain, frequent urination.  Terrible.  I have been back off Belviq now for a day and the symptoms have decreased tremendously.  I hope they go away completely.""",3
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""When I started Adipex on 1/15/16 I weighed 224 lbs this is the heaviest I&#039;ve ever been. My doctor said I hit a plateau. I work in a doctors office and when I went to work on 1/26/16 I weight 208 lbs! I weighed myself on 2 other scales because I couldn&#039;t believe it. I wasn&#039;t hungry at all but I knew my body needed nutrients so I have been having protein shakes.  I drank 1 in the morning and one in the evening and I took a multivitamin everyday as well. I have literally lost 16lbs in 2 weeks. Excited to see what I weigh at the end of the month...""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the Implanon in early January 2012 and I haven&#039;t had a period at all since. I&#039;ve noticed changes in my mood like, hypersensitivity, mild depression, and mood swings. Another important thing I&#039;ve noticed is my hair gets very oily very fast after a shower. Within 3 hours after I have fixed my hair all nice, it become very oily and I find that to be a big issue for me (I cannot stand oily hair). The plus side to it, it made my skin so beautiful, I didn&#039;t have acne for the first 5 months, but I&#039;m starting to see acne starting to pop up more often and weight gain. """,8
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I love this cream. My doctor prescribed this to me for acne (cystic, and blackheads). This was a dream cream for me. I am 23 years old and have been suffering from acne since about 14. Ive never had clear skin since using this stuff - and ive tried every product - even then expensive luxury products. This smoothed my skin after 2 weeks of use, made my hyper pigmentation from years of acne drastically improve. I do understand this is very drying, because it is speeding up creating new layers of skin. Because I don&#039;t want to be blotchy with dry patches all the time, I use this cream every other night, and moisturize thoroughly the next morning. I couldn&#039;t be happier with this cream because I&#039;m finally able to not wear as much make up!!!!""",4
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""Been taking Brintellix for 2 weeks and so far feeling pretty good. I&#039;m a little worried about the weight gain and the price. I finally find something that works for me and it causes these side affects and ridiculous how pricey it is to feel normal! Sad to know that if I can&#039;t afford it or it puts weight on me that I&#039;m going to have to stop taking a drug that actually helps! I work out 4 days a week and had lost 22 lbs but I&#039;ve gained 4 in 2 weeks.Not acceptable! I will continue taking for another 2 weeks and see what happens!""",5
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I took generic ambien (not the CR) for just two consecutive nights. While it does work for putting me to sleep and keeping me asleep, I have to say I would not recommend this to people.  Just take benadryl or Advil PM.  

The reason I say this is because it affected (and days later is still affecting) my memory.  I am told by a few friends and co-workers of things I did or said (during the daylight hours, work hours) and I honestly don&#039;t remember any of it!  

So for me... I won&#039;t take this again just because it scares me. I&#039;m sharp as a tack, I remember and observe everything so this really shocked me.""",0
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had my Nexplanon inserted a little bit under 4 months ago and have had a few ups and downs with my experience. When I first got it, I had a normal period and then didn&#039;t get another period for 7 weeks. When I did get my period, I bled for 14 days (which seems to be pretty short compared to a lot of the reviews). Again, I waited another 6 weeks until I got another period and then had bleeding for a little less than 2 weeks. I haven&#039;t experienced any weight gain on Nexplanon although I exercise pretty regularly. Before getting Nexplanon, I never broke out and rarely had greasy skin/hair, but after getting it inserted, I get occasional pimples and my skin and hair get extremely greasy throughout the day.""",8
Dapsone,Acne,"""I have been using Aczone for about a month now.  I have had acne for years.  I am now 26 and have recently experienced a pretty bad flareup of my acne, so for the first time I went to the dermatologist.   After a couple of bad products, I finally got introduced to Aczone...and I love it.  Since starting on it, my skin has cleared up dramatically without peeling or sensitivity issues.  I use it once a day and have managed to still be using the tiny 3 g tube that I got as a sample, so a little goes a long way.  I have a coupon for it when I finally fill my prescription (which I WILL be doing, regardless of the cost).  Also, it&#039;s important for me to say that I am not on anything else--just Aczone.""",4
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""My sleep cycle got disrupted due to stress.  Was not happy with ambien or lunestra, I felt like both knocked me out and I would not know if the house was burning down.  Take 30mg of elavil.  Now I just sleep like a regular person.  I can wake up, take a leak, go back to bed, sleep away.  I regularly sleep 8 to 10 hours with this, which I never had previously in my lifetime.  I do get super sticky tongue  due to the dry mouth.  However, that is a small price to pay to sleep.  I am extremely happy with the medicine.  I have been to Europe twice from the west coast with the least amount of jet lag ever.  I actually slept on the plane!

Works for me.""",0
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I have lost 30lbs on this medication. I started on the low does for 2 weeks then started the high does. It is a bit expensive, insurance does not cove this and it went up to $141 from $131. Make sure you get the rebate card/ coupon. There are some side effects. My hands or feet will start to tingle randomly, anything carbonated.. forget about drinking it, it all tastes flat. My doctor told me it will change the taste of chocolate but right now chocolate still tastes the same! I don&#039;t crave sweets as much when I take the medication month after month. I haven&#039;t had it in about 2 months and I let go. Gained some weight but I&#039;m back on it. I highly recommend working out with this medication and eating healthy and you will see a huge difference.""",3
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Man oh man. Let me tell ya&#039;ll about this implanon birth control. I got this implant in my arm one month after I had my twin girls. I just got it taken out yesterday, I had this piece of shit a little over a year. Putting it in isn&#039;t bad. But I bled for that whole year and one month! Extremely heavy. At one point I thought I had to go to the ER. Not only that hair loss is one of the side effects that they don&#039;t tell you about in the doctors office. My hair has gotten so damn thin it&#039;s a shame. PLUS don&#039;t forget about the acne that never goes away, no matter how many times you wash your face lol. I&#039;ve read that woman gained weight on this, but for me it was the complete opposite, I lost a lot of weight.. Plus constant mood swings!""",8
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I have suffered from moderate to severe acne for years. I have always had bad breakouts that coincided with my cycle in my teen years. I assumed this would go away once I got older. However, it seemed to get worse throughout my mid-twenties. I am now 28. I would get cystic acne mostly around my mouth &amp; chin area. I always had 4 or 5 huge red pimples.  Not only unsightly, they were painful &amp; would last for weeks.  I tried everything - cleansers, masks, creams, toners, diet, antibiotics, &amp; bc (10 ). Accutane was the last on the list...until Spironolactone appeared. My doc prescribed me the min 25mg dose per day. The 1st week I noticed a change! My skin cleared right up &amp; I have had ONE pimple in the past 3 weeks.  I am amazed.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!""",4
Nucynta,Pain,"""I have been in constant pain for 17years (since I was 12) RSD, Chronic Migraine, Fibromyalgia, myofacial pain syndrome, sjogrens, and several other things. Tried everything to manage the pain and gain some of my life back. The only thing I found that helps is Nucynta. I have been on it for about 4 years, (1) 100mg tablet every 4 hours. It&#039;s a love/hate relationship. It&#039;s the only thing that helps my pain, but I hate waking up every morning going through withdrawal bc I&#039;ve been on it so long. I tried the ER but it wasn&#039;t as effective. I know it&#039;s not good to be on it for so long but I&#039;m at a loss for any other options to try, and it really does help me be more functional than I was without it. Besides the withdrawal I have not had side effects""",9
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""My story is really long and complicated. I was originally on Xanax and all it did was make me sleep. Switched doctors because my original doctor wouldn&#039;t switch me off the Xanax. New doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I was upset at first because I didn&#039;t feel I needed it, I thought Lexapro was an anti-depressant and I wasn&#039;t depressed.. About a month after I started taking the Lexapro I felt amazing! But then I lost my health insurance so they put me on Paxil. I miss my Lexapro! It was the best.""",7
Accutane,Acne,"""I agree this drug works very well BUT make sure you continue to read the possible side effects every so often so you can continually monitor yourself for them, EVEN the rare but documented ones.  My 16 year old daugther developed pseudotumor cerebri from taking minocycline for acne which disappeared after stopping the medication and then she started accutane - 5 months now. An eye exam today showed the same thing is happening.  Swelling of the brain that mimics a brain tumor.  HAVE YOUR EYE EXAMS WHILE ON THIS MEDICINE - PAY ATTENTION TO HEADACHES. It is a rare but documented side affect of both medications.  Will show up in an eye exam but diagnosis takes other tests including MRI and lumbar puncture to measure the spinal fluid pressure.""",4
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking  Quetiapine for over 15 years, I started off taking 25 mg and over the years it was increased to 1000mg a night. Recently found out that my liver is double the size and I am quite concerned. I have been lowering my dose to 450 mg a night with clonazepam and I am still sleeping. I haven&#039;t had vivid dreams but started getting panic attacks last year. To be honest I am scared of the affects of taking this medication for over 15 years, my doctors, while being concerned haven&#039;t checked my blood regularly and now I am scared to death about my liver, reviews say that I need to stop taking this drug..but it works... Please make sure that you are having regular bloodwork done every 3 months. But this is the best sleep aid out there!""",0
Orlistat,Obesity,"""The key to using Alli is that you must list everything you eat and not exceed the amount of fat per meal.  I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects and am extremely pleased.  I lost 10 pounds before starting the program and hit a plateau, but since using Alli, I&#039;ve lost 27 more with only 13 pounds to go.  When I reach my ideal weight, I&#039;m going to continue the tracking, eventually weaning myself off of Alli, to be able to maintain my weight.  I don&#039;t expect a quick transition, but love the results.  I recommend trying it, but be diligent to follow the instructions for good results.""",2
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""Tried 3 milligrams of Lunesta did not work at all to help me sleep. But right now I am suffering from extreme anxiety and depression. And have other health issues and a ton of stuff on my mind. I also just tried Ambien ER last night and it did not work either. In the past couple years ago I did take Ambien and it worked to make me sleep but after taking 4 a week or so made my anxiety and depression worse.  Be careful if you suffer from depression taking this medication is what I found out. I only recently tried to take sleeping pills again out of desperation as I have developed some bad stomach problems and possibly my pancreatitis flaring up and have been off of work for 2 months on workman&#039;s comp worried about losing my house and my healt""",0
Lyrica,Pain,"""I have severe pain in my legs and chronic fatigue. Been going to doctors for over a year, have had 3 MRI&#039;s, and gallons of blood taken and tested. Yet nobody knows the source of these symptoms. Due for a muscle biopsy soon. While taking tramadol and hydrocodone had great results for energy and pain, I became dependent. I was prescribed Lyrica 50mg about 2 months ago and felt a little relief. Doctor raised the dosage and now I take 150mg 3 times a day and the results are amazing. I&#039;m alert, energetic, and pain free. Have a little dizziness now and then, but this medicine is great.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking them in May 2015, I weighed 196, first week I lost five lbs, I did get dry mouth dizziness, constipation, and insomnia, had to force my self to sleep, and doing Zumba with this pill and a Herbalife pill with or without it together I felt like my heart was jumping out of my chest when exercising it did give me a boost of energy but I started freaking out about it, also my bones like the joints started hurting.. Think they warn u to take calcium or iron pills, vitamins. Month later I&#039;m at 182.  After that I would take half here and there then stopped  till October. Now I weigh 176 I&#039;ve started researching cause of chest pains, tired, headache, all the negatives I&#039;ve read when they were tested, not worth the health risk""",3
Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,"""No dude it doesn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve been on it for few months. No it doesn&#039;t work for anxiety. It helps the shaking part. That&#039;s it. Doesn&#039;t work for depression either. When I was on it I hurt myself and was thinking about suicide. It didn&#039;t stop my racing thought. My OCD is the same. Man just no. I gained 40 pounds in 2 months just with 250mg. It&#039;s the worst medication of its category. I was on Zyprexa before but besides the horrible weight gain at least I was doing much better. I hate this medication. Do not take it people. It makes you fat doesn&#039;t help at all. No man just NOOO. I&#039;m going back to Paxil 30mg and Zyprexa 7.5 mg which work so much better. Bye SEROQUEL.""",6
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the Nexplanon July of 2014 due to my previous IUD (Mirena) getting lodged into one of my ovaries and needing to get it removed. Before that, I had tried all different kinds of birth control pills, ending up either getting sick, forgetting to take them, or too expensive.
The first six months were great; periods regular and no noticeable side effects. After six months, though, I began experiencing drastic mood swings and waves of depression. My period disappeared for about a year, and I began gaining weight rapidly. Now 2 years in, I have visible acne for the first time and have been bleeding for over 2 weeks with painful cramps. Also having insomnia, lower sex drive, and more intense anxiety. I plan on removing it when I can afford to.""",8
Balziva,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been taking it for 4 months now. After 4 months I can say that my body has adjusted pretty well to these meds. The first 3 months I suffered with very tender breasts, headaches, breakthrough bleeding, bloating, and nausea, but month 4 has been a breeze. I&#039;m 28, had NEVER had a menstrual cycle, extra hair growth, abnormal hormone/thyroid levels. This has worked wonders for me. Just give your body 3 - 4 months to adjust to it! My cycles are regular and last 5 - 6 days now.""",8
Lidocaine,Pain,"""I had tried patches before and nothing stays on but about 4 yrs ago I tried SalonPas which were ridiculously inexpensive so my expectations were extremely low and they stayed on UNTIL I TOOK IT OFF BY CHOICE OVER 6 HOURS LATER but they they contained no lidocaine ...within last month I heard they came out with lidocaine patches and rushed to get them ..only $8.00 for box of 5 or 6 and so happy I did they have come through again with low cost effective (more so than name brand) pain relieving product..""",9
Zoloft,Depression,"""This medicine has been a game changer for me. At first I was terrified of taking this drug.  After reading Catholic Guide to Depression and much prayer I had the courage to take the medicine.  I&#039;m so glad I did.  It actually reduced &quot;body aches&quot;. I&#039;m running  again, 6 days a week.    It&#039;s not a miracle pill, but a fantastic tool in defeating depression and body aches. Peace!""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""This is my 3rd day on contrave and the side effects are what are worrying me. Severe nausea comes and goes throughout the day. Sometimes it gets so bad I can&#039;t even get up and move around. I have also had sporadic hot flashes and excessive sweating. The worst side effect I saw it was on the first and second day hello when I would have terrible drowsiness to the point where I had to hold my eyelids open just stay alert and aware of my surroundings. I&#039;m not going to stop taking the medication but I&#039;m worried because my doctor prescribed for me to increase a pill each week until I am on 4 pills a day. I&#039;m a female, 25 years old, 5&#039;3 &amp; weigh 253lbs. Is this too intense of an increase? Suggestions are appreciated.""",2
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I was having severe insomnia to the point where I was only getting 1-2 hours, at the most, of sleep a night. I started to hallucinate after a few days of this and was prescribed Ambien. It works fast (within 10 minutes after kicking in to fall asleep), but I only sleep 4-5 hours on it and then wake up refreshed. I don&#039;t get my full 7-8 hours. Not sure what&#039;s up with that. I tried Ambien CR and it took longer to fall asleep on that and I still only got around 4-5 hours of sleep on the CR version. I still use Ambien and it&#039;s better than Lunesta which gave me a nasty taste in my mouth and didn&#039;t even make me tired. Overall, I recommend Ambien.""",0
Celexa,Depression,"""On Day 1.  Felt a little out of it but some how relaxed.  I&#039;ve yawned most of the day and woke up promptly after 8 hours of sleep.  Glad I will be able to make it to work on time.  A little ringing in the ears.  Otherwise so far so good.  I&#039;ve been afraid of SSRIs for sometime now.  Had a manic spell with Effexor (SNRI) a few years back.  Doc ramped me up on Lamictal first just in case.  Doxepin to sleep as needed.""",5
Differin,Acne,"""This is a miracle in a tube! I had moderate to severe adult acne and would have breakouts on my cheeks, jawline, and chin that would leave dark marks for months. I have oily/sensitive skin. At first, the gel burned A LOT and I got a few more pimples, which are side effects of the product. But now after about a month, my skin is adjusting and looks better than it has in years! Little to no pimples and dark marks are fading!
My Routine:
Morning- Wash face in lukewarm water with Dove Exfoliating Soap, then apply Aveeno Clean Complexion moisturizer. 
Makeup - e.l.f. Blemish Control Primer and BB Cream
Night- Same as morning routine, but add Differin gel after washing face with soap, and apply Aveeno moisturizer about an hour afterward if needed""",4
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I have been talking this medication for 8 weeks now and following a low carb diet and am happy to say I have lost 25.6 lbs. I have not started exercising yet, but intend to, so the weight loss is all diet. This medicine is excellent and gives you the ability to turn down food you know is not helpful to your goals. It has also wiped out all my cravings. My blood pressure is 118/74 and I have have experienced no side effects.""",2
Topamax,Obesity,"""Awful.  I lost 10 pounds in 5 weeks before I had to quit Topamax due to side effects, which were terrible.  They included:  memory loss and &quot;senior moments&quot; which increased 10-fold, I think this medicine dropped my IQ at least 15 points, that &quot;I&#039;m not part of this world&quot; feeling of disconnectedness; and overheating to the point that I simply could not work out.

Gained the 10 pounds back within 3 weeks of quitting.""",2
Tramadol,Pain,"""I was given tramadol for back pain. It does not do much for the back pain but I noticed that is sure did something for my energy level and focus ability I have chronic fatigue I have severe fatigue all the time no matter how little or how much rest I get. I find that taking 100 mg of Tramadol when I get up and a 50 mg around 2 pm keeps me focused and feeling like a normal human being who can get normal human being things done all day. I explained this to my doctor and she now has stopped prescribing it to me because I am not using it for what she gave it to me for. I am so mad. I feel like a scolded child. I am a 45 year old woman who found something that worked for the condition that was depressing me to say the least because I was so tired just moving around""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started on 37.5 mg. of phentermine yesterday, May 15. I had planned on starting with a half a pill, to see how it would be, but they are capsules prescribed by my primary physician, so I had to take a whole one. I have had no harsh side effects, thus far. I took it early in the morning and it did not disrupt my sleep last night. I did the same today. It definitely curbs my appetite and I have to make sure I remember to eat now. I am 5&#039; 11&quot; and weigh 200lbs. My goal is to continue with this medicine and eating healthy, along with exercise. Good luck to all who try this med.""",3
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am 16 and I started using Vyvanse a little over one month ago. I am a very bright student but I found myself struggling through school. I was diagnosed with ADD around 4th grade. I have always had trouble focusing and staying on task. I tried Concerta, Ritalin, Strattera and Adderal. After taking those I took about a 4 year break from medicine. I began Welbutrin and am now taking that in combination with Vyvanse. My grades improved tremendously. I can now focus and it shows. I went from a D in Algebra/Geo to an A. My life and confidence has improved more than I ever thought possible. I do have decreased appetite but other than that, this medicine is literally making my future brighter everyday.""",1
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""Diphenhydramine didn&#039;t work for me so I tried doxylamine. First night took one 25mg pill and was out within the hour, got a full eight hours but woke up super groggy. The groggiest lasted most of the next day, definitely wasn&#039;t worth it. I tried it again two days later with only half a pill. Had the same great sleep with only minimal grogginess. I&#039;ve continued to take 1/2 a 25mg pill 2-3 times a week when I know sleeping with be a struggle with great results. I&#039;d recommend anyone who experiences the sleep hangover to try a lower dose before writing it off.""",0
Kadian,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been taking Kadian 60mg 2x day for severe back, knee, hip and hand pain. I have a failed knee replacement from 10 years ago and have been taking Kadian ever since.  Controlled pain mostly but also taking Norco 10/325 two pills 3x day for breakthrough.  Just yesterday my pain doctor increased the Kadian to 80mg in the morning and 60mg at night.  I can&#039;t imagine what my life would be like without the pain relief I get from Kadian.  I tried Fentanyl patch with no relief (then I heard of the deaths caused by the patch), and tried Oxycontin and again no relief, so Kadian is for me.  Only issue is it is extremely expensive.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Had my first follow up today, been on Phentermine for 25 days and I&#039;m down 19 lbs. Few side affects...cotton mouth, anxiety occasionally like twice a day for a brief period and constipation which has lead to hemorrhoids. But, given the success of 19 pounds in 25 days, they side effects are definitely not severe enough to stop. I thought about stopping if the weight wasn&#039;t coming off but it definitely is. I encourage you to use my fitness pal and track what you eat as well. I&#039;m a 6&#039;4 male that started at 322 pounds. All I eat is between 1200-1500 calories per day and feel great!""",3
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My Grandson was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago when he was 7. We started him in councelling and they recommended we try medication. I resisted not knowing much about ADHD.  They tried him on a couple of different medicines (without success) before we tried Vyvanse the first dose 30mg did show a vast improvement but it didn&#039;t last long. We increased the doses several times before reaching his current dose of 60mg.  Like the others have stated he has loss of appetite and trouble going to sleep. They continually monitor his weight and take blood samples to make sure there is no harm to liver and kidneys. He still has occasional meltdowns which we have learned to recognize. In school he has gone from impulsive to compulsive but again it runs in spurts.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I was on Accutane when I was 16 for about 8 months. I first took 40 mg a day then he moved it to 80. The only negative side effect I had was dry lips. My doctor kept me on it longer because I have extremely sensitive skin and can&#039;t use topical things like benzoyl peroxide because it makes my break out in skin rashes.  I have had clear skin up until about six months ago. I am 24 so that&#039;s 7 yrs of clear skin. I am going back to my dermatologist this week so hopefully he will put me back on it because it is amazing. I would seriously stay on it forever if I could.""",4
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I lost 30lbs in about three months. It makes you not want to drink soda or eat sweets because it taste nasty, which is good because those things are bad for you anyways. The side effect that I have is EXTREMELY dry eyes which cause inflammation but I can control that with wearing glasses instead of contacts and using the Blink eye drops. I went off of the medicine for two months and gained 5lbs. So I started it up again hoping for good results. I started off weighing 210lbs.""",3
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""So I put the ring in on the first day of my period, 2 days later my period stopped and I am feeling nauseous, very tired, lost in appetite, and some discharge. I knew it was just my hormones changing so I knew it was going to pass. Within the three weeks I started to notice how much I was sleeping, mood changes, weight gain, and feeling completely horrible about myself. On the 21st day I took the ring out and a day later I have an unbearable itch/ burn. I went to the doctors and they believe it was from my hormones changing. The ring is very effective I&#039;ve had intercourse plenty of times with no complications like pregnancy or UTI, etc. I will not be putting the ring back in bc the hormones and side effects are too much for me to handle.""",8
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""10 days on Lunesta (generic).  Not sure why doc suggested I try it, as I&#039;d been on same low dose of ambien for 3 years, good results.  Anyway, had the metallic taste, just annoying but I slept so ok.  After a day or so waking up more, sleeping less. Took an extra 1/2 last night -total 4.5 mg.  slept, but today all day major headaches and nausea. Not sure what to do tonight-wishing for backup benedryl.  Calling doc tomorrow-will request back to ambien.""",0
Celecoxib,Pain,"""I was in a lot of pain in my lower back and shooting pain down my leg for months, and had increasing difficulty in walking and sleeping. I had been forced to use a cane, and a scooter to get around and I could no longer walk any distance.  I had to stop physical therapy because the pain was too bad and epidural injections seemed to offer little relief. The MRI indicated that I had tissue from a herniated disc and protruding disc was pressing on the nerves so I was scheduled for surgery. I was given a prescription for  Celebrex ( 250 mg/ 2 times/day) 8 weeks before surgery to help relieve the pain. One week before surgery, I was told to stop taking Celebrex.  The pain has not returned and the surgery was cancelled. I am now essentially pain""",9
Aczone,Acne,"""I am a 49 year old woman with acne, rosacea, and sensitive skin and I have finally found a solution in Aczone.  My face is nearly clear.  I won&#039;t say it&#039;s perfect, because I do have an occasional stray bump here and there, but my whole face simply calmed down.  I&#039;ve reduced the number of medications I use to three - aczone, oracea and kuric cream.  I am not photosensitive to this like I have been to other topical treatments. It is a little drying but nothing like some other medicines I&#039;ve tried. I found an improvement almost immediately. I am thankful that it has been placed on the market. It&#039;s worth every penny to me.""",4
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on this medication for a few years and it worked wonders on my mood.  I can get moody very quickly and while taking this medication, mood swings were rare.  Unfortunately, I began suffering from body tremors and had to stop taking it.  My hands would shake uncontrollably and my head actually shook back and forth.  I didn&#039;t notice it but when I would talk to my sister, she would tell me that my head was rapidly shaking back and forth.  That is why I rated this a 9 instead of a 10.""",6
Seroquel,Insomnia,"""Seroquel has saved me from the anxiety of not falling asleep at night. I too was on Ambien and some natural supplements. I felt like I was living outside myself in a fog. After Seroquel, I sleep and I&#039;m rested. Occasionally have killer nightmares that are different than other dreaming I&#039;ve had. I did gain about 10 pounds as I got the munchies before I went to bed. I have that under control and I&#039;m not munching, have lost 5-6lbs. Did have a terrible time getting up in the morning, but I am hypothyroid. Doctor added 100 mgs of Wellbutrin and I can get up now. Wish I could sleep without all that, but can express the level of gratitude for this gift.""",0
Concerta,ADHD,"""Had ADHD symptoms growing up, due to cultural reasons and beliefs, family always dismissed it. 
In 2nd year law school at the moment, had to work 5x harder than others. Started living away from family and finally got ADHD diagnosis done. Was prescribed concerta. 
I was 154cm height and 47kg before concerta. 
Titration period - 18mg 1 week, 27mg 1w, 36mg 3w and 54mg 8w. 18-27mg at first was amazing. No side effects, brimming with motivation but, wore in 4h. 36mg, was ok but wasn&#039;t as great as the initial effect, wore off after 4h. 54mg, developed an uncontrollable cough, mood swings, dry mouth, anxiety. Lost 5kg weight. Now on Vyvanse. Cough took 2 + weeks since quitting concerta to stop. Advice - if side effects are bad &amp; lasts 1w+ change meds!""",1
Tenuate,Obesity,"""I was just placed on Tenuate 2 days ago by my physician. I have tried many weight loss options but have had no success. I just have no will power. I am an RN, and reading about this medication I must say that I am going into it a little frightened. But, if you all can do it...so can I! I was so motivated by your many success stories, I hope that I can be one to post one also. My first day mirrored some in that the dry mouth and jitters are what bothered me. I don&#039;t think I will be able to take the medication at work. That will be okay, I don&#039;t have much time to think about food anyway. Lol! Best of Luck to you all!!!""",2
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""SSRI&#039;s meant no orgasms and didn&#039;t help me sleep. No such problems with mirtazapine. Sex is even better, sleep is wonderful and I get enough and can function within minutes of getting out of bed.  I get brain zaps at sudden noises if I&#039;m relaxed, and it increases my appetite a lot.  Thankfully I&#039;ve taken up distance running at the same time. You must exercise on this medicine to overcome the weight gain, which is it&#039;s worst side effect. All up this medicine has been wonderful and after horrible experiences with SSrI&#039;s I&#039;m glad to be on it.  Found out afterwards that my girlfriend is also on it for insomnia.""",5
Tramadol,Pain,"""Yes, I have experienced a side effect of Ultram which is preventing me from sleeping. It has 50 mg 1 or 2 tablets every six hours as need. I have tried them from my doctor and I have been up all night, I had a total left knee replacement revision on the 8th of June, 2011. I was told also to take 1 Ambien (10 mg) and 1 extra strength Tylenol at the same time. I did and all I did was cat nap and was always awake when the daylight came up. I need REST!""",9
Doxycycline,Acne,"""In my teens, I had pretty bad acne. My doctor said it would clear up by 20. I&#039;m now older and still am dealing with it. What has worked for me for the past ten years (with about two flareups a year) is: doxycycline 100mg twice a day (my plan is $5 for three months supply), Clearasil (10% benzoyl peroxide) tinted in the morning, and Metrogel (1% metronidazole gel) &amp; Adult Acnomel (resorcinol) tinted in the evening. """,4
Monodox,Acne,"""I have been taking Monodox now for 2 weeks and have seen amazing results. While it&#039;s not completely clear yet I have seen fast results the first week my face was really dried out but after a while it got better. I do feel sick to my stomach when I take it though, especially in the morning so I take it around noon and I have to eat something. But the results are worth it. The dermatologist also prescribed me with a morning cream called Benzaclin and a night cream Atralin. I believe together the creams and medicine are clearing my skin. After having it since I was 13 it would be nice to have clear skin.""",4
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I took this drug awhile back, I was on it for 3 years. I don&#039;t recall ever having side effects while initially starting or during taking it over time. This drug seemed to help my depression and anxiety significantly, probably more than I actually realized at the time. Only problem I had was, if I missed a dose I&#039;d be hit with massive emotional distress. Crying over the stupidest things rather it was positive or negative crying. My emotions were intense. After a long time without medicine now, trying to beat depression and anxiety on my own and being somewhat successful for an extended period of time I&#039;ve been contemplating using it again. I&#039;ve tried almost all of these meds, and this is the one that&#039;s worked for me the most.""",7
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Saphris has helped me more than any other medication (which were many, many over 12 years). I was blown away by the benefit and bewildered that it took so long for someone to prescribe it. I still don&#039;t have the strength and energy that I need but I am functioning at 80% to 90%. Before it was barely hanging on with suicidal periods. Savella was another good medication for me but not quite this good. The racing thoughts, paranoia, and insomnia are gone. I usually fall asleep within 15 minutes of lying down. Although I am having some nights of waking up after 3 hours. Just getting to sleep earlier and getting the required sleep I need has made a tremendous difference in how I function and cope. My side effect has been arthritis and weight gain.""",6
Vilazodone,Depression,"""Viibryd worked wonders for me.  I have to admit the first week was hell as it made me extremely anxious but after the transition I couldn&#039;t believe the difference it made.  The only problem I ran into was insurance companies don&#039;t want to pay for  it because it is expensive. I ended up having to switch to another drug that was not nearly as effective.  I&#039;m thinking about going back on Viibryd and paying for it out of pocket.  I just have to ask myself what is happiness worth??""",5
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien for more years than I can count due to insomnia and nightmares.  I have experienced the &quot;sleep walking&quot; activities, mostly repetitive conversations and eating which have been benign and harmless.  Fortunately, I have family that is up later than me so they keep me from doing anything too outrageous.  Sometimes I have a vague memory of my activities if my husband brings it to my attention, but if I am particularly stressed or anxious the side effects are amplified and my memory is gone.  As for morning grogginess, a shower usually perks me up.""",0
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I started on Saxenda on February 14, 2017. My weight was 295 lbs, I am 6&#039;3&quot; tall and 55 years of age. Today it is March 8, 2017. When I began using this product I experienced some sickness, itching and I was very tired however the appetite suppression effect was immediate. As such, I modified my diet to include more healthy and &quot;weight loss friendly&quot; foods. I also upped my doses every 4 days instead of every week as recommended. I am very pleased to announce today that all of the symptoms except the itching have resolved themselves. I have been on a full, 3.0 dose since March 2nd. At this time I am 281.2 lbs,  which is down about 14 pounds. My goal is a 50 pound weight reduction and I feel that with Saxenda this is a very realistic goal.""",2
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I am 5ft and weight 204 pounds. I will start tomorrow 8/12/15 on Belviq. I&#039;ve done a lot of research before going to my Dr. for this medication. I&#039;ve spent hundreds of dollars on all sort of weight loss medications. Though Belviq is on the expensive (thank God for the manufacturer discount) end I&#039;m willing to try it. I already work out 30 minutes a day. So I&#039;m very hopeful this will work. I will post an update in 30 days""",2
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Hi everyone! I&#039;m a sixteen year old girl who has been struggling with acne since the beginning of high school. My self confidence definitely crashed and I always seemed to have to cake foundation on my face before going anywhere, and I just wanted my acne to be GONE. So it has been exactly 2 1/2 months since my physician prescribed me to tretinoin Retin-a 0.05%, and the first thing I did was look up reviews about it. I was terrified of the possible &quot;purge&quot; so I waited until a week long break from school to start using it, and to my surprise, no special purge on my skin! My forehead and chin have always been okay; cheeks and nose have been the biggest problem, but generally my skin is smoother and less red! STICK WITH IT!!!""",4
Nucynta,Pain,"""I have been on Nucynta for 2 years following a ten - twelve foot fall. Nucynta is without a doubt the best pain medication I have ever been prescribed. It works well  on my severe shoulder, back, and neck pain. Without the nasty side effects of other opiates I was taking such as Hydrocodone. I am able to stay alert and I have not built up a tolerance to it. Nucynta has been a game changer for me. . .""",9
Aviane,Birth Control,"""I have been on this pill for close to 7 months now. I started having sex with my husband around month 3 when we got married and I noticed a decrease in sex drive, a few heavy period days and a few light period days but they were always during the placebo week. I feel hungry at night and in the mornings, and crave sweets more than ever. My weight has been pretty stable. I had a few yeast infections and vaginal dryness and nothing sucks more than telling your husband you can&#039;t because it hurts too much within the first month of marriage!!""",8
Accutane,Acne,"""I am now 55 years old.  I started developing acne when I was 14 .  It became so severe that my parents took me to a dermatologist.  This was back in the 1970s when all that was available were antibiotics and infrared light treatment.  It worked on and off, but after several years my body built up a resistance to the antibiotics and the severe acne returned.  I was prescribed accutane when I was 29.  My acne cleared up in 3 days!  I had some mild side effects: dry skin, dry lips (which continue to this day).  But my skin is crystal clear and has been for almost 30 years!!!  I highly recommend this wonderful medication.  I don&#039;t know what my life would have been like without it,""",4
Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I have been on Pristiq 50 mg for 2 days now.  I suffer from a host of illnesses, fibromyalgia, CFS, migraines, depression, etc. I have noticed a tremendous increase in my energy in just 2 days. However, I have been having severe abdominal cramps after eating (and I am eating light), but my psychiatrist advised me that the stomach pains should subside shortly.  I finally got through a day with a much more positive attitude.""",7
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am on 2mg of Abilify now. Went up to 4 mg but was too tired all day, could not function. 2mg a day of Abilify along with 250 mg of Zoloft and 7.5 Zyprexa works extremely well for me. It helped mostly for my depression and gave me my energy back. Sleep great and no side effects (as long as I don&#039;t take more than 2 mg of Abilify). If you are suffering, talk to your doctor about trying Abilify. I started very slowly with the dosing.""",6
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""So I suffer from depression, OCD and anxiety.. I have been on sertraline (Zoloft) which has helped with everything but hasn&#039;t helped with all the anxiety (evening and morning anxiety.. I have problems turning my mind off at night).. I also have had sleeping issues for years and my zoloft made it worse. My Primary Care Physician prescribed Trazadone to take before bed. I sleep so well when I take it, but I have to take it early enough or I can&#039;t wake up in the morning. It knocks me out and I do get a restful sleep but lasts in my body for a good 10 hours.. So I have to be aware of when I am taking it at night. If it is too late then I don&#039;t take it.. Thus I don&#039;t get a restful sleep, but at least I&#039;m not late to work. Overall I recommend it.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Overall, in my experiences I have learned that in terms of extremes... the  Methylphenidates will turn you into an emotionless robot, hollow inside, socially avoidant person unable to experience life&#039;s pleasures. Nothing makes you happy, but at the same time,  nothing can make you sad. 
 
Whereas with the Amphetamines (like Adderall and lesser extent Vyvanse) you become an extremely emotional, almost volatile, person who can experience pleasures in an extreme way. You get so overjoyed by the little things but the smallest of pet peeves can really set you off. 

Vyvanse has been the best one for me. Just be aware of how you are treating those you love especially several months after starting. You may need a secondary med to balance mood.""",1
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I started Saxenda on 1/29/2016. To date I have lost 26 lbs. I began at 178 and have lost an average of 2 1/2 lbs a week since then.
I am following a 1000 calorie a day diet, (with my doctor&#039;s approval) and am journaling my food, which helps tremendously.
The first week, at the lowest dosage, I felt a little jittery. That dissipated within 2 weeks.
I am up to 3.0 and I have had no side effects except constipation.
It has been a very positive experience for me. My goal is 145 lbs and I am sure that can be achieved in the next four weeks.""",3
Oramorph SR,Pain,"""I was prescribed name brand Oramorph SR for chronic back pain. I was taking 130mg 3X a day, I had bad nausea, severe edema. Most disturbing was the odor emitted from my skin, breath, and from bowel movements.

I would rate the pain relief &quot;so so&quot; and the side effects where not worth the pain relief obtained. Just look out for the swelling of the feet and legs.

I guess this medication was not the right one for me, as with most pain medicines we need to use trial and error to see which medicine will work best, in any given patient. 

Wishing you all a pain free day.""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""For years I had been battling behavior problems with my son who is now 10. He was not a bad child but had no concentration span, would fidget, annoy others and was falling way behind children the same age as him. Finally we managed to get him seen by a specialist. He is now been on Ritalin 15mg for 4 months and the change is unbelievable. He is already catching up with his school work, making more friends as he understands them better and is generally just more content and happy. At first he was teary and clingy when first put on them but that soon went. The only down for my son is that he is not as hungry as he used to be and lost a lot of weight in the beginning but is steadily putting it back on now.""",1
Tapentadol,Pain,"""Was skeptical when doctors swapped me from endone to slow release (SR) tapentadol. Huge headache and nausea 1st week. Over next month felt like the twice daily 50 mg would wear off in 5 hours.  So specialist has doubled dose to 4 x per day. I feel a bit weird for the first hour after taking it but thats better than the up and down effect of endone. I feel like the pain is better controlled now taking dose 4 times per day. But general doctor was reluctant to increase, so very glad I saw the specialist and his recognized that pain that SIJD causes.""",9
Tramadol,Pain,"""I been suffering from herniated disc, osteoarthritis, restless leg syndrome for about 5 years now, I took so many different medication but nothing helped. My husband who was recently diagnosed with MS of the spinal cord started taking Tramadol for pain. He told me that is very good medicine and was helping him with pain and his mobility. I told my doctor to prescribe it to me and he did. I take it twice a day and feel great. I am pain free and I have so much energy, I also have clear mind, I can concentrate better. I recommend this medicine to anyone who is suffering from pain. Try it and you will see what I mean.""",9
Accutane,Acne,"""After dealing with acne for my entire life I finally took my doctors advice and started Accutane. I was a little skeptical at first because of all the side effects but every other cream/oral medication had failed. The first month I didn&#039;t see much of a difference so then he upped my dosage from 20mg to 30mg. The second month I was completely clear and he put me on 40mg the third month my face was terrible it was like I wasn&#039;t even taking Accutane but that only lasted like 2 weeks and then I went up to 80mg a day and wow did it work. I am currently on month 7 and my face has never looked better. I don&#039;t have to wear any makeup before I go out and I feel 100% confident. The chapped lips are bad but I use Dr. Dans hydrocortisone chapstick.""",4
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking this drug for nearly 2 monthsfor my PCOS/pre diabetes. Started at .6 dose, went up to 1.2, and had to go back to .6 because I am so violently ill all the time. It is taking me days to digest the same meal (I know because I am vomiting up food I ate days prior), my reflux is out of control (drinking maalox, eating tums, and now on *80 mgs of Prilosec* to control it). I feel like my entire life is on hold. I can&#039;t eat anything outside of the house because I need to be near a bathroom, and ironically I have lost about 1 lb through this entire ordeal, and my blood sugar remains steady at around 118. When I see my doctor next she is definitely going to hear about this. I do not see any reason to keep taking this medication.""",3
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I am a 44 year old Hispanic female. I am 5&#039; 1&quot; and weigh 156 lbs. I wear a size 10-12 dress. I started Saxenda yesterday, August 2, 2016. I am terrified of needles and did not think I would be able to give myself the shot this morning but I handled it like a champ.  I had some slight burning at the injection site but it quickly faded. I have had no nausea but have a horrible headache.I had a slice of wheat bread with 2 tsp. of peanut butter for breakfast and had to force myself to take a few bites at lunch.  I have no appetite and feel full after drinking a glass of water.""",2
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this birth control for 2 years now and I love it. It is the only birth control I&#039;ve ever been on and it has not made me gain weight or any of the &quot;usual&quot;  side effects. The only thing I can say is I don&#039;t like is that I don&#039;t get a period every month. It comes about every 3-5 months. Which sometimes can be very frightening when you have an accident and sometimes birth control does fail but luckily Loestrin 24 hasn&#039;t failed me yet.""",8
Ketamine,Pain,"""I have taken oral ketamine for 17 days. For me it is a miracle drug for neuropathic pain. Started at 10 mg daily by 2.5 mg caps compounded by pharmacy. Side effects are wet mouth or excessive salivation, a dizziness that my body adjusted to quickly, a feeling of two beers or a slight intoxication, mild anxiety.  The reward of a 3 point drop in neuropathic pain level is worth it. I feel my old arthritic pain again much stronger. A 8 as the CRPS specific pain is a 4-5!  Oral metabolizes into norketamine &amp; hydro norketamine 5 times stronger than Ketamine. The iv dosing at high levels does not get this first pass metabolism and levels are higher mg than 15 mg. going to 20 mg after ok from doctor. I recommend patients with severe nerve pain.""",9
Restoril,Insomnia,"""This is the best sleeping pill I&#039;ve ever tried. 30 years now, and still no tolerance issues. I wake up refreshed,  no hangover, unlike all the other sleeping pills, as temazepam is very mild, yet it keeps you asleep.  I take 15 or 30 mg, depending how I feel.  I have tried Halcion and Dalmane, which weren&#039;t very effective.  I also tried Ambien in the mid 90s and had horrible sleepwalking episodes.  This has never happened with Restoril.""",0
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""Started on 10mg while seeing a mental health professional (counselor) simultaneously. Medicine kicked in at about 3 weeks of treatment and got better when MD increased the dosage to 20 mg 6 weeks into treatment. It&#039;s been a consistent once daily oral capsule 20 mg for the past 3 1/2 months. Mood has lifted. Wakes up with clear thoughts. Lessened racing negative thoughts. Reduced anticipation of negative events and occurrences. Obsessive compulsive rituals reduced. Answer the phone with more ease and less concerned about making mistakes in front of people. Anxiety greatly reduced, lessened depressive thoughts. Definitely helps you to look forward to life. It works better to see counselor at same time so you can track progress.""",5
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am 18 years old and just graduated high school, all of my life I have had issues with going to school and getting things done. Always had great grades the first months of the school year then they would drop to C&#039;s, D&#039;s or failing. I was put on Vyvanse 1 day before my 18th birthday and it completely changed my life. Not only am I a much happier person, but I actually take interest in things and like finishing things I start! I have noticed some weight loss, but my appetite is and always will be still there. I&#039;d really love to thank whoever discovered the wonderful prescription Vyvanse!""",1
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I was having horrible anxiety attacks, panic attacks and was border line manic. I was going through a lot of stress and hit my limit. My family urged me to see a Dr who started me on 2.5 lexapro for a week then up to 5 mg the week after. I stayed on 5 mg for 1 month seeing improvements. Eventually I decided to bump up to 7.5 which I&#039;m currently on . I still get anxiety but I am able to feel in control.  I don&#039;t have attacks anymore. I&#039;m sleeping better and eating again. Side effects only lasted the first month . I got really tired 20 min after taking it , drowsy, night sweats. Make sure to take it with a snack, I find it hits the stomach like a rock. Over all has given me my life back. And I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m on medication.""",7
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It got so bad I couldn&#039;t function and my Dr took me off work for 5 weeks and gave me 30mg of cymbalta (generic).  By day 10 I noticed a big improvement..about 60% better.  I see Dr in 2 weeks and she will decide if I should take 60mg.  I really don&#039;t want to and I&#039;m hoping I will continue to get better on the 30mg.  I guess I will wait and see how I feel.  I think therapy is a must for people with anxiety so we can learn ways to help stop the negative thoughts and not let them ruminate on a repeat reel in our head.  I have found that there are things we can learn to help with that along with the meds.""",7
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have a bleeding disorder so can&#039;t take NSAIDs. Unfortunately, I also have arthritis and shoulder pain. I was taking Tylenol #3 but didn&#039;t like the mental clouding side effect. Tramadol has worked great for me. I take 100 to 300 mg a day, tending toward the 100 side with 300 being for active weekends of running and biking (300 spread out in 3 doses, not all at once, obviously). This works really well. I&#039;m giving it an 8 because of the side effects (constipation and dry mouth). 

I&#039;ve skipped a couple days with no problem and no overwhelming desire to take it (other than I hurt!)""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;m going into my 5th month on accutane at 60mg. The first 4 months yielded minimal if any results and I got the biggest cystic lesion in my history of acne in the 3rd month. Now, my skin is cleared of acne lesions and congestion. My skin is red, sensitive, and scarred and hyper pigmented. My eyes are dry and my lips require Aquaphor frequently. Overall, this medication has brought me confidence that I forgot I had. My derm said &quot;wow look at your skin it looks wonderful.&quot; It made me emotional to hear. If you are considering this drug for persistent acne then my recommendation is to make this decision with your doctor. You will not be disappointed. Nothing else worked for me and I tried every med out there topically and orally, hormonally.""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got this inserted 6 months ago and it&#039;s nearly been the worst time of my life, no exaggeration. I became a completely different person. I feel exhausted, lazy and tired all the time, angry, depressed and I have lots and lots of mood swings. This has nearly ruined my relationship. On top of that I&#039;ve bled since the day I got it, and now for six months straight. If you think about getting nexplanon, PLEASE DON&#039;T!
I removed it today and look forward to be myself again. Now I have a sting in my arm, a big bruise and when this all heals I&#039;ll be left with an ugly scar. It was sooo not worth it. The ONLY positive thing this has brought me is that I didn&#039;t become pregnant, but because of all the bleeding I&#039;ve barely had sex anyways...""",8
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had kyleena inserted about 5 weeks ago, and have been physically uncomfortable or in physical pain ever since. I&rsquo;m 19 and have not given birth or ever been pregnant, and I was told I have a retroverted uterus by my gynecologist before she inserted the kyleena. Insertion was horribly painful, and the rest of that day I was in EXCRUCIATING pain - think of the worst period cramps you&rsquo;ve ever had and multiply it by 70. I was sweating, crying, and literally screaming and groaning in pain. I have never felt such unrelenting physical pain like that before. I felt much better the next day, but after that I&rsquo;ve had intense period cramp-like pain almost every day since, causing me to double over while at school and work. So far I&#039;m not a fan.""",8
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I have been on Doxycycline for at least 10 years straight for acne. I saw a big improvement in my skin when I first started taking the drug in my thirties. Now that I&#039;m 48 and entering menopause, it seems to be a little less effective because of my hormonal changes probably. But I have never had any side effects with this drug, which is great considering the amount of time I have been using it.""",4
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Just wanted to share my POSITIVE experience using Mirena. I have always had really heavy periods, accompanied by intense cramping.  I&#039;ve had the Mirena for about a year.  My periods are tolerable because they&#039;re so light and only last for 3-4 days. Cramps have disappeared, which is like a dream come true.
My skin is clear, I have not gained a pound. I don&#039;t feel all weird from hormones like I did when taking the pill-possibly because the hormonal release is localized.  initial cost was $370 dollars but if you spread that over 3 years, that&#039;s a little over 10 dollars a month. I wish that I had been offered this option when I was 17-better late than never! I&#039;m 28.""",8
Restoril,Insomnia,"""I feel like I&#039;ve been on very sleeping aid option to treat insomnia. With no success of anything I&#039;ve tried my doctor prescribed  Restoril. FINALLY something worked! I get a full 8 hours of sleep. My doctor also prescribed me Paxil on top of my regular Abilify for depression and anxiety, because I started to have anxiety before going to bed out of fear of not being able to sleep. So the drug combo has worked a miracle for me. I build up tolerances to medication very quickly, so now we&#039;ll see how long I last on Restoril. But I&#039;m praying that it continues to work for me. I highly recommend Restoril.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Spent the last year eating very healthy and exercising with very little weight loss results. I got desperate last week and went to a weight loss clinic and got on Phentermine and B12 injections. Weighed in last Tuesday at 169.7lbs and went in for my one week check up and weighed 165.3 with jeans on and last time I was wearing shorts so I&#039;ve lost about 4.5 pounds in one week. You have to push through the first three days of jitteriness and insomnia and then it levels out and you feel normal. I have experienced some pretty gnarly dry mouth despite how much water I drink but it&#039;s worth it if these results keep up. I&#039;ll update again in a couple weeks!""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""After 2 years of very slowly losing pounds to reduce blood pressure,doc prescribed this drug.I reached my half-way weight loss goal(13lbs) after a month taking it daily.I stopped taking it and kept exercising and gained about 4lbs back.Doctor advised I keep routine and take drug for 2-3 days if I gain a few pounds. This drug was extremely encouraging after being stuck in a weight loss rut.Drink tons of water,you do not want to dehydrate on this! Be very aware of mood changes and addiction.""",3
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""Have been taking temazepam  to counter waking up at 3 am every night for many years.  It has helped me sleep through the night, but I am noticing more confusion, memory problems, some balance issues, dizziness, lethargy.  I have cut back from 2 pills/night to 1 with some difficulty with getting to sleep.  I would like to slowly cut my dosage once again to see if it would clear up what I think are the side effects  of taking this medication.  I would like to get off it completely and see if yoga and relaxation CDs might help me instead.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Works better than any other stimulant medicine I have tried. I have sensitivity to stimulants; it causes bruxism. The bruxism is absent with a 20 mg dose, and minimal with a 30 mg dose. Other Stimulants - I cannot take even the lowest dose without getting the bruxism side-effect to the point I can&#039;t stand it. Also, I can&#039;t &quot;feel&quot; when it starts working and stops working - which is great. It wears off slowly starting about 7-8 hours after I take it. After 10-11 hours I do not feel it in my system anymore. No Insomnia or &quot;crashing feeling&quot;. Weight loss (ok since I am fat) about 25 lbs in 3 months. My only complaint is it makes me want to smoke. I quit smoking a long time ago. I think about wanting to have a cigarette several times a day.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 24 year old female who was diagnosed with ADD last July. I&#039;ve been on Ritalin, Adderall and now Vyvanse. I started off on Vyvanse 30 mg about a month ago. It didn&#039;t do a thing for me. My doctor upped my dosage to 50 mg a little over a week ago. Since then things haven&#039;t been too pretty. My mind is clear, which is great but I&#039;m completely unmotivated to do anything. I don&#039;t want to clean. I don&#039;t want to leave my house. I don&#039;t want to do anything. I feel exhausted. I guess it&#039;s like a zombie like state that I wouldn&#039;t mind if I didn&#039;t have a child and a house to care for. I&#039;m hoping my doctor will switch me to Adderall XR. I&#039;ve always lacked energy and this definitely isn&#039;t helping.""",1
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Depression ever since I can remember.  Had 15 good years on Prozac, but it stopped working.  Have been trying all kinds of antidepressants &amp; in December I was put on Lamictal.  Worked up to 100 mg, stayed on for awhile, not much happening - thought it was just another med that wasn&#039;t going to work.  My doc said the &quot;therapeutic&quot; dose so am slowly titrating up to 200 mg - currently at 175/day.  Just yesterday I think I started feeling the miracle of Lamictal kicking in!  Yesterday and today I have felt better than I have felt in soooooo long - don&#039;t stop before the miracle happens (unless you have bad side effects, like the rash, which thankfully I do not have).  I want to shout my gratefulness from the rooftops!!""",6
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I am on day 7 @ 0.6 and from day 1 this medication curbed my cravings.  I work a job that is 75% travel and easy to just drive through a fast food joint.  Just left a national meeting in NC and for the first time ever I did not stop at Bojangles for a chicken biscuit and sweet tea.  During the meeting there were spreads of cookies, cake and pie and I did not even want it!

I am not weighing myself but I can feel a difference in the way my clothes fit.  This medication was recommended to me by my best friend who is a rep for the company.  She told me it would change my life and so far she is right.

I had some slight nausea but it is bearable.  Heart burn is something I&#039;ve always had and treat it with nexium. I notice a little burping.""",2
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have tried many medications for bipolar disorder.  All had to be discontinued due to side effects.  Then I finally tried Geodon.  I have been on it for about a month.  This has been the best tolerated and effective medicine for me so far.  It really stabilizes my mood shifts.  And I tolerate it well.  The major side effects for me are restlessness, anorexia (a welcome side effect!), a little anxiety, and morning drowsiness.  I went from taking this medication 40 mg twice a day to just 80 mg at night, and my morning drowsiness subsided.  I am glad I tried Geodon.  I hope its positive effects continue.""",6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""After being on Tamaze for 15 years, I was told I need to go off it, as it is a drug of dependency &amp; dangerous to mix with my pain meds long term. For the next 6 months without it, I was lucky to get 1 solid hr of sleep without waking every 10 minutes &amp; would go for many days with no sleep at all. Eventually my doctor said having no sleep is just as bad for me long term &amp; prescribed me Belsomra 20mg, as doesn&#039;t have the same chemical make up as most sleeping tablets. Even though expensive it has been a life saver for me and when I do lie down, I&#039;m usually asleep for 5 or 6 hours solid. I have many side effects &amp; allergies to most medications, but Belsomra has very few side effects, which I have none so far &amp; worth ever $$""",0
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had a really good experience with Hysingla ER. I have had dibilitating Sacrio, SI Joint, sciatic nerve pain for 6 years. Tried chiropractic care, acupuncture, massage therapy, physical therapy, injections, electro shock therapy, and norco 10/325 4x per day for the last 4 years.  I did get some relief, but not enough to make my daily life enjoyable. It&#039;s been a struggle with pain daily. Especially with three small children.  Two months ago, my pain dr recommended Hysingla ER to me (as a last resort before surgery) and I decided to give it a shot. I started at 20mg, 4 weeks later 30mg, 4 weeks later 40mg.  I can&#039;t believe the difference of my life since starting Hysingla!! I can take long walks again! I can grocery shop again!""",9
Retin-A,Acne,"""I was suffering from acne due to my sensitive skin and severe summer heat.  I tried my teenage time acne cream in my late twenties but i felt it was too mild to work on my much matured skin like now. Then one of my friend, was a satisfied user of Retin A , suggested me to use Retin A 0.05%. I stated it in the winter to avoid over sweating and heat of summer. I face little flaky skin. first 2 weeks my acne breakout little more than the usual. but after that, acne seemed to be decreased. Whenever I feel too dry skin other than the acne affected area, I used pure Vaseline. Now I am cured and my skin is glowing. I am continuing the use of Retin A with my regular night cream as anti-aging properties. And I am quite satisfied with this.""",4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I witnessed a friend get amazing results from this so I thought I&#039;d give it a try. I started at 199lbs and a month later I am at 181lbs. So lost a total of 18 lbs...not too bad. I haven&#039;t had any side effects. Maybe a few headaches when I first started taking the pill but nothing too bad. 
My appetite has definitely decreased. Normally, I am hungry all the time and never feel satisfied but now I eat a little bit of my meal and I&#039;m pretty much full. I have also lost cravings for chocolate and sweets which is nice. I drink more water than I used to because I often get dry mouth. But now, I&#039;m finding it harder to see the numbers drop on the scale. I go to the gym almost everyday for about 1 1/2 hours. Hopefully, the numbers will start dropping again!""",3
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""First off. Side effects.... Brain zaps. Pounding heart, foggy feeling. First 3 weeks I felt the need for a lot less Ativan. The worry stopped and blood pressure came down . I&#039;m on 5mg per day. Around week 5 I started to notice my blood pressure going back up. Acid reflux and a little nausea. Pounding heart back. I don&#039;t want to give up on buspar because I was so happy to lose the everyday worry. On week 7 now. Still at 5mg. Thinking about doing 5mg twice a day. There is no magic pill, but this was close.""",7
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I started Qysmia in December 2016 and had the finger and toe numbness, trouble sleeping and anxiety but that only lasted the first 10 days or so. In the past year I&#039;ve lost 50 lbs and that&#039;s without a ton of changes. I noticed a huge change in my appetite. I wasn&#039;t someone that overate to begin with which was why my weight was frustrating but now I notice I have to make an effort to eat meals because I&#039;m rarely hungry. I have plenty of energy to do everything I need to do. I am at my initial goal weight but now looking to go an extra 10lbs lighter. If I add moderate exercise, the weight comes off quick which was impossible before Qysmia. I highly recommend this! It&#039;s tough the first 2 weeks but past that, it&#039;s been super easy for me.""",3
Escitalopram,Depression,"""Lexapro gave me terrible nightmares.  I jump out of bed while asleep. I tore both of my arms up and hit the closet door with my head. 
 I scream in my sleep, I break lamps with my flailing arms while I am a sleep.  Every side effect listed I have!  I fall all the time, I stumble around.  This is a terrible medicine!!  Never again!!  It seems to be taking forever to get out of my system after I stopped it (without my Dr permission).  What happens now can not be as bad as the side effects I have!!""",5
Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I have only been on Pristiq for a week and I can already tell a difference! My only side effects are jaw clenching, thirst, waking up in the middle of the night and weight loss. The jaw clenching is tolerable and if I pay attention to it, I can control it... except when I&#039;m sleeping. The weight loss is awesome. I have been trying for years to lose weight and in 4 days on Pristiq, I lost 6 pounds! It really does suppress the appetite. Sex is still good, no side effects there. I have been on Zoloft (terrible migraines) and Lexapro in the past. The Zoloft was bad, liked the Lexapro, LOVE the Pristiq!""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hi, I&#039;m 31 female. Just shy of 5&#039;4. I started phentermine on 12/28/15 weighing 184, now I&#039;m in the middle of my 9th week and I weigh 165, so in 2 months I lost 19lbs, my goal is 145. I weigh in at my clinic every Monday evening. I do cardio &amp; weights 4 to 6 days a week. The first 3 weeks I ate strictly protein and veggies with some fat, I&#039;ve slowly added in complex carbs and fruit. I drink at least 90oz of water a day and have 3 meals and 2-3 snacks, the days I don&#039;t work out only eat the 2 snacks. The side effects I&#039;ve had are dry mouth, dry skin and constipation (despite my water and fiber intake). I recommend the smooth moves tea by traditional medicinals, but test it one a day where you can be near a bathroom so you know how you react.""",3
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""Pristiq has significantly helped my depression.  I am finally able to wake up and get through the day like a normal person!  Initial side effects (first few days to a week): Dizziness, blurred vision, dilated pupils, fatigue, waking up in the middle of the night, jitteriness.  Ongoing side effects: dry mouth, frequent urination, jaw tension, falling asleep earlier than normal, inability to have an orgasm, and decreased appetite.  The side effects can be a bit annoying, but the benefits far outweigh the side effects.""",5
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My son has been taking intuniv for 3 years now and has shown major improvements. The prior medications were causing my son to have tics and violent outbursts. This medication helps him more with concentration and focus but when that is under control i notice the hyper activity is more tolerable. My sons grades improved drastically and i no longer receive phone calls from his school and teachers (this was a weekly if not daily occurence).""",1
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I took this back when I was 15 and it was perfect for my terrible anxiety and insomnia, 25mg knocked me out completely and put me to sleep. I&#039;ve been on melatonin for the last few years as quetiapine made me too drowsy the next day, but recently I have been back on quetiapine as I have been finding my anxiety keeping me up at night. I&#039;ve put myself back on a 12.5-25mg dose and it&#039;s worked
Wonders. It feels euphoric, and puts me to sleep like a charm. Downsides: I&#039;ve been feeling so out of it during the day, drowsy, harder to wake, plus I&#039;ve had a few headaches and stomach upsets. Also scared I&#039;m going to gain weight as that is commonly reported? As far as doing its job as a sleeping pill though, it&#039;s incredible.""",0
Yasmin,Acne,"""I got really bad acne when I turned 14 and my period wasn&#039;t regular and  after trying a lot of things I started taking yasmin when I was 15 and my acne started to clear up in two to three months of using it I went off it when I was 17 and the acne came back really badly so I went back on it  until I turned 19. I thought my hormones would be normal by then I was off yasmin for 3 months it seem to go good but I didn&#039;t get my period at all and then I started breaking out again so I&#039;m back on yasmin since then .""",4
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""Xanax may have saved my life. In the early nineties I was a young man pursuing my ambitions career, cars and women. Whatever I have done / experienced led me to be violent in my reaction to assholes. Also mom raised me as she went through menopause and was volatile. I was dangerously aggressive in my early 30&#039;s. xnx worked with no side affects noticed, sleepiness at first, that&#039;s all.I sought xnx because it made me feel like I should, calm, thus able to focus. Did well all these years. I got laid off, Doc retired and I can&#039;t find a local doc to prescribe.  The system took it away, Clandestine alternatives are expensive, risking life, limb and employment,  Docs are ignorant sometimes.""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I have been using Ritalin 10mg for the past 3 weeks now. I am 28 years old and i suspected for a long time now that I have ADHD. Not being able to concentrate or focus, prioritise tasks and having depression (i am not taking medication for this) caused a lot of anxiety for me over the past 4-5 years. 
Ritalin has helped alot with my studies and kind of calms me. I am pretty quiet when i take it also. Its great for if you need to use it for work or study , but for everyday use I wouldn&#039;t like it.
- In the first 45mins it gives me a slight euphoric feeling.
- Makes me want to do productive activities.
- Causes slight headaches if i don&#039;t drink plenty of water.

I would recommend it.
(I have tried adderall in the USA and that was even better)""",1
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""I have been taking 15mg at night before bed for 7 months now for anxiety, depression, weight loss due to a c.diff. infection (antibiotics). Mirtazapine, along with 20mg of fluoxetine has literally saved my life. I had been on only SSRIs before, but after this last bout, nothing was working. I had lost 25lbs and could not sleep at night, was crying all day, not eating, pacing all night, and wanted to crawl in a hole. I have gained the 25lbs back (and then some), have a ravenous appetite all day long, but it subsides when I exercise regularly. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed. My partner is happy, too (no sexual side effects). Love this medicine.""",5
Imipramine,Pain,"""I was prescribed this medication for chronic widespread musclepain(fibromyalgia) and neuropathic pain,and allodynia all over plus vulvodynia. It does take the edge off,and the pain is not as intense as it used to be, but still continuing sadly.  It did take away my sleep paralysis episodes,and sleep hallucinations, amazing for sleep too.Its a great drug, its the only one I can tolerate, I tried amytriptyline and all the SSRI&#039;s but the side effects been horrendous,and had a devastating effect on my functioning.The only effects imipramine have on me is some dizziness and drowsiness during the day, fast heart rate, and mild loss of libido, but other than these I feel its very useful with pain and sleep.The first few days expect nausea,and somnolence.""",9
Cymbalta,Depression,"""I started taking Cymbalta after my doctor prescribed 2 other medicines over the space of 8 months, they made me feel worse not better. I was so ill I was hospitalised at one stage.  It took Cymbalta quite a while-  about 2 months, to kick in noticably, however my depression was severe. The nausea was awful the first two weeks and dizziness lasted about a week with me. I am pretty sensitive to medications however. I have been on Cymbalta for almost two years- at a high dose (90mgs). I do find I am hot and sweaty (at times), I need a lot of sleep and have put on weight, (though HRT could have caused this). However these side-effects are a small price to pay to live a normal life and be free.""",5
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Update on my review from 2 years ago: still on Trazodone and still singing its praises. Since my first review I have moved across the country and consequently have different insurance and different doctors and I&#039;ve had such an oddly difficult time getting it refilled. My last doctor refused to refill it and I had to go without for 4 months. It severely impacted my health as I was unable to sleep alongside my ever worsening mental state (depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc). As far as medication goes, Trazodone is the only constant for me.""",0
Restoril,Insomnia,"""First I tried Ambien, loved it! But after a week or so I started having a reaction of itching so they stopped it. Then on to Lunesta it gave me a headache every morning but it did make me sleep.  They stopped it. Then on to Temazapam 30 mg. It works within 1-2 hours. I sleep good for 6-8 hrs. Usually, sometimes I still will have trouble falling asleep or waking in the night but it&#039;s not every night so it&#039;s an improvement!""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My 6 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD and started on Vyvanse 4 weeks ago. He has made HUGE strides in school.  His teachers and I are all very impressed with what this medication has done for him academically.  However, he has become an emotional wreck.  If he isn&#039;t on auto-pilot or mentally checked out, he is snapping and yelling at people at the drop of a hat.  He zones out, acts and appears to be &quot;high&quot; .. a shell of him himself.  It breaks my heart to see my fun loving, humorous vibrant little boy become a drone so that he can be successful at school.  He is on the lowest dose of 20mg.""",1
Lortab,Pain,"""I have been given this medication 4 times this year. The first time was in March for a pulled tooth. The second was after my gallbladder surgery, third was after hernia ,and this time was for some more dental work. For years both codeine and hydrocodone gave me horrible side effects and reactions. But I think I&#039;ve built up some tolerance to medicines over the years. I have to take Phenegran with it and half a Benadryl. It makes me semi nauseated and itchy. It mellows me out and helps oh so much with pain. I have been given various strengths and even liquid form. Works great!""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started the medication on 5/28/09 and its now June 9th.  I have lost 6 lbs in eleven days. I am happy with the medication and it definitely helps with the appetite. However, you do have to exercise and watch what you eat. I don&#039;t have those sweet cravings now. I have had little to know side effects. I really haven&#039;t noticed having extra energy but do have dry mouth.  I chew sugarless gum and drink plenty of water.""",3
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I took Effexor for 10 years and found it highly effective controlling anxiety/panic attacks.  After deciding to stop [with Doctor&#039;s approval], I reduced my dosage gradually, and am discontinuing it.  Withdrawal has been rough - like the worst hangover - and I&#039;m into the 5th day but getting better.  However, my mood is still good compared to 10 years ago, and I would like to be medication-free.  Effexor allowed me to control my anxiety/moods through some tough times and through it, I learned new ways to deal with such.  I highly recommend it.""",7
Bupropion,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been on Wellbutrin for over a year now and I will probably be on it for the rest of my life.  I have a dry mouth occasionally, food doesn&#039;t taste as good as it used to, and it makes me sweat a little more than normal, but without this medication I would be in a fetal position, in bed and crying most of the time.  I would never even consider going off of it. I&#039;ve tried for just a couple of days and the old symptoms of sadness start to set in.  I took Zoloft for a while and it made me gain weight and I just wanted to sleep all the time. I was a zombie.  If it weren&#039;t for Wellbutrin, I would probably be a recluse.  Nothing interested me and I didn&#039;t want any social interaction.  Now, I can&#039;t wait to get out and be around people. GOOD!""",1
Adapalene,Acne,"""I have had acne on and off for around 5 years now. I am a 22 year old male. I moved to Dubai and it got gradually worse over time. I started taking epiduo for around 8 weeks and it helped a little. I then came off it due to my skin my being pretty sensitive. My dermo prescribed me Tetralysal and Differin. Now the differin is very delicate on the skin in my opinion. I have taken for around 2 and a half weeks. I am currently going through the initial breakout and its bad. My general skin tone is tonnes better but we will have to see!""",4
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""Golly I am disappointed. I tried this for my anxiety because it was getting out of control. I could not extend conversations beyond a minute or so without getting all flustered. Could not think, started to sweat, heart beat faster, tightness in my chest, hands tingle, could not breathe. None of those are fun things! Even basic day to day stuff like getting a haircut would freak me out enough to avoid. My hair looks terrible now! So my Psychologist and MD recommended this drug. He, the MD, told me he took it himself for public speaking . &quot;Take one 10 mg tablet and a feeling of calm washes over me.&quot; Unfortunately I have been taking it three days now, two 10 mg pills three times a day, and I feel absolutely nothing.""",7
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""Been on Effexor since July 2014. I take the lower dosage 2x a day as the higher one all at once made me feel sick. I have severe anxiety to the point where i didn&#039;t want to leave the house.   I am also on Ativan for moments i know when i panic...way better than Xanax.  I was on Paxil, Wellbutron...neither worked, made me feel like a zombie.  The only drawback with the Effexor is that I am exhausted!!""",7
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was prescribed different medications for issues I was experiencing after my Traumatic Brain Injury and then a murder/suicide involving my father and brother. I don&#039;t remember all the different medications I had tried, but I did test Lamotrigine 150 mg 2x- 50 mg 2x. This medication helped much more than anti-depressants alone, however it caused me to have anxiety and depression worse. It&#039;s somewhat of a catch 22. Now I just changed my bipolar medication to Seroquel and am doing so much better.""",6
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""When I was young I used to suffer from anxiety.  After the years its stop on its own. Now that I am living alone all my anxiety came back.  I been taking them for 8 months and let me tell you is the only thing that works. I can now sleep and love to come home. Before I used to get so scared thinking of death all the time. I used to wake up my two kids at 2 in the morning thinking I was dying and I will drive to my moms house. Now I feel like I am living a Normal life.""",7
Accutane,Acne,"""*Sebaceous Hyperplasia*, The one change I am most thrilled about is it got rid of all of my sebaceous hyperplasia (enlarged oil glands) bumps within the first week! I started getting these hard bumps about 5 years ago and 26 days ago, I had about 40 of them around my hairline and some on my chin, forehead, and cheek and my chest was starting to get super bumpy, today (day 26 on Accutane) I don&#039;t have a single bump.
*Acne* As far as my acne, I am definitely having a flare up and it feels like all of my blackheads are being pushed out and so my skin feels very bumpy, but as of about 5 days ago I don&#039;t have to blot anymore and I can go 3 days without washing my hair.""",4
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I slept well as a young adult, but by my mid forties I was only sleeping about 4 hours per night, and only 2 or 3 hours if I was under stress. It finally got to where I having a lot of anxiety, grinding my teeth at night (with a sore jaw in the morning), and even started showing symptons of ocd. I started Elavil (Brand name in Canada) 10mg at bedtime six years ago, and it has made my life so much better. I sleep a solid 6.5 hours every night, and feel great. The teeth grinding and the ocd symptoms both stopped within the first 2-3 weeks. It took a few days to start taking effect. I also had a slight tremor during that first few days only. I had a somewhat dry mouth for the first two years or so, but not at all now. 10mg still works for me..""",0
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started Adipex (phentermine) on June 26th 2012. I weighed 239 lbs and I am 5&#039;4, 42 year old female. I had the typical spare tyre that women have a tendency to get over 40. I was obese and in danger of getting a number of diseases that would have affected the rest of my life such as diabetes,  hypertension,  heart disease. I have come a long way I am down to 178 lbs as of today. I am beginning to have a show down in results. I need to increase my exercise as I only lost 6 lbs the last month. I did however manage to lose 11 pounds over thanksgiving and Christmas. The doctor is extremely pleased with my progress as is my husband.  He has a new wife. I have never felt better.  I have dropped 10 sizes.  28 pounds to goal. Go me.""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""Well, for the longest time I was on 20 mg and I felt okay. Which was a lot better than the constant anxious mood I was in and I could finally go to school. The last 3 weeks, I was on 40 mg after trying Wellbutrin and having a terrible reaction to it. But in the two days that I came off of celexa, only taking 20 mg again, I had the worst withdrawal symptoms. It might work for you but after a while it didn&#039;t work for me.""",5
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I was having major panic attacks to the degree that I could not function. I&#039;m terrified of all medicine, but when youre having anxiety to that degree, you&#039;re willing to try most anything for relief. I started out taking 0.5 mg 2-3x/day. Built up a tolerance after a few wks and was increased to 1 mg, but I don&#039;t take that dosage unless necessary. This med has helped me so much with no side effects that I can tell.""",7
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I started Qsymia on December 1, 2015 and so far I am down 25 pounds. This medication has curbed my appetite immensely and has completely changed the way I look at food. Now I eat to live, I don&#039;t live to eat. I do have dry mouth and some occasional tingling in my feet, but nothing too bothersome. I also get some constipation, but I have GI issues from multiple auto-immune diseases, so that side effect kind of counteracts that in my favor. The only complaint is that my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it, so my current dosage runs about $130 per month; however, that a small price to pay to lose the weight. The weight loss is strictly the change in diet so far, as I really haven&#039;t gotten back to an exercise regimen yet.""",2
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and had a knee replacement recently. I was having a lot of pain and the short term medicines were not helping.  I switched to this on the advice of my physician and it is the difference between night and day. One pill in the morning and one at night keep me from derailing.  I am able to do my Physical Therapy, go to work, and have energy for the first time in a month.""",9
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""My mother has cancer. With that she has anxiety. The Dr prescribed her vistaril 25mg. Granted it kinda helps anxiety but it contributes to hallucinations. When I leave her off of it she has anxiety when she takes it, her dreams are vividly real. Weigh your options or decrease dosage but if a loved one is taking this medication before mental diagnosis try replacing or removing this drug for at least 48 hrs.""",7
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Been taking 0.6mg since Friday 27th January. The first dose was taken at 7pm as I had read that it does make you feel tired. So far, I have felt mildly nauseous and tired, but I tend to sleep it off so I am ok for the remainder of the day. 

Now on my third dose and I decided to drink low calorie ginger ale to curb the nausea. It seems to be doing the trick. I do have a loss of appetite so I need to remind myself to eat so that I keep my nutrition up. I must admit that I did feel thirsty for the first couple of days and wake up in the middle of the night feeling a bit spaced out with a slightly elevated pulse, but this goes away by mid morning following a small snack.

Will wait and see if this results in meaningful weight loss""",2
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Started taking this a few days ago. The comment about the bad taste~ UNDERSTATEMENT, it tastes NASTY, but seems to be working well. I am currently on Seroquel 200 mg, temazepam 45mg, and Xanax as needed. I am dropping down on the Seroquel until I&#039;m completely off. Horrible weight gainer, but does help. Since starting this, I have not taken ANY Xanax and I have energy during the day and it seems to curb my hunger.""",6
Strattera,ADHD,"""I have been on Strattera for almost a year. This is the only ADD medicine I have tried so I do not have experience with others. It helps me focus in on one thing and gives my brain a rest from all the thoughts. It also helps me sleep at night because my mind is not wandering. 
Some side effects I have experienced is weight loss (almost extreme from 120 to 100 in 5 months) although I have gained about 5 pounds back and am still working on it. 
Also I am very thirsty all the time, so keep water with you everywhere! . Lastly I have to take it on a full stomach or else it will give me a severe stomach ache.
Overall, this medicine has really helped me be able to enjoy life and want to spend time with the people I love!""",1
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I have been on Tenuate 75mg since March 9th.  I have dropped 20 lbs in approx. 9 weeks.  My calorie goal is 1100-1200 although some days I am lucky to reach 600. I am just not that hungry. I also changed my eating habits.  Grilled chicken vs fried and lots of salads with reduced or fat free dressings.  Tenuate and My Fitness Pal have been my &quot;crutches&quot;.  I still have a long way to go but I am determined to do it!""",2
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""Tried the generic version after a few rotations of Ambien.  The only thing I disliked about Ambien was the weird loopiness I&#039;d get.  Read over some journal entries I wrote on Ambien and it definitely freaked me out.  I didn&#039;t notice a weird metallic taste when I took Lunesta.  The sleepiness also didn&#039;t hit me as hard as with Ambien, but it definitely peaked after about an hour and I knew it was time for bed.  Woke up fine, no headache and no weird journaling. So all in all a good experience and will likely ask for this instead of Ambien in the future.""",0
Adapalene,Acne,"""I started using differin 0.1% in November 2016, fast forward to January 2017 and I couldn&#039;t be happier! I&#039;m 26 and have been battling with acne since I was around 13. I have tried all sorts of products and regimes and sometimes had success but it never lasted long. I had tried differin before but never stuck it out long enough to see its full benefits, this time I did and my skin is thanking me for it. I&#039;ve kept my skin care regiment very simple. I use a very gentle cleanser in the morning then a benzyl peroxide 5% gel then a moisturiser on top. In the evening I use the same cleanser then the differin cream, I always allow it to soak in for at least an hour then follow up with my moisturiser. This cream takes time to work but be patient.""",4
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I love this method of birth control.  I have had very heavy periods and cramping since I was 11.  Mirena has virtually erased my period.  I have had some light spotting on and off since insertion 2 months ago but that&#039;s a small price to pay.  Zero cramps.  Zero!  No crazy side effects like what I experienced on various brands of oral contraceptives.  
I have 2 kids and that&#039;s enough so I&#039;m happy that I don&#039;t have to worry about birth control for the next 5 years.  
Insertion was a breeze.  About 30 seconds of heavy crampy pain and light headedness but then I was fine.  I didn&#039;t take any of the painkillers that my Dr. supplied me with prior to the procedure.""",8
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""For me, this is the best hypnotic of all that I have tried to date, which includes quetiapine, mirtazapine, amitriptyline, trazodone, zaleplon and doxylamine succinate. All of these meds have their pros and cons but quetiapine gives me the most sleep overall and it&#039;s a such a cheap costing med as well. I typically only need to take 12.5 mgs for a good night&#039;s sleep. Now, this med may not be for everyone, as it a an anti-psychotic, and it does have the potential to cause some pretty severe side effects. Proceed with caution.""",0
Cariprazine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I remember eagerly waiting for this medicine to come out, and when it finally did, I think I must&#039;ve been one of if not the only patient my psychiatrist had on it. At first, while taking it in the morning, I felt super nauseated (lost weight from it actually), and felt like I didn&#039;t want to get out of bed for anything. So I started taking it at night, which helped a little, but then it suddenly became stimulating for me, so I started taking it in the morning again. That&#039;s when I started noticing the therapeutic benefit setting in, which took roughly a week to start setting in. I quit taking it a month and a half later because of akathisia, but decided to give it another go here recently, and haven&#039;t really had any problems.""",6
Minocycline,Acne,"""Can&#039;t say enough good things about Minocycline. I suffered from moderate/severe acne on my face, chest and back all throughout high school and this medication was the only thing that helped me. It took about a month to start to see results but after about 3 months I had absolutely no acne ANYWHERE. (Of course I made sure to have a good washing/topical regimen too) Just make sure you take this with no dairy products (they cause antibiotics to not work as well)and drink a lot of water . Minocycline is a live saver""",4
Nucynta,Pain,"""I have been taking Nucynta for about six months. I am 5&#039;4, 220lb, 42 year old female. This medicine worked very good 6 months ago, still works, but not long enough, and break through pain is stronger and returns faster. Side effects for me are dizziness=mild, thirst=severe,voice change=severe, sleepiness=mild, agitation=increased enough to have to say I&#039;m sorry. Also a strange eye problem kind of feels like my eyes are yawning, but I am not yawning. """,9
Seasonique,Birth Control,"""I just started Seasonique almost two months ago.  For about the first five weeks, it was fine and I didn&#039;t have a period or spotting.  Although, for the last three weeks I&#039;ve been bleeding like a normal period.  Also, ever since I started taking it, my libido is really low and I simply have no sex drive.  My gyno says that the bleeding is just my body getting used to the new drug, but honestly, a three week period.""",8
Roxicet,Pain,"""I was prescribed Roxicet 5-325 for pain relief after major abdominal surgery and I have to say this was amazing! I&#039;ve never had such complete relief from any medication before.  One tablet every 4 to 6 hours kept me completely comfortable. It made me a little sleepy, but that was fine given that I was recuperating from surgery.  It would probably not be suitable for me to take while working.  The only real side effect I experienced was a little nausea, which I learned to minimize by taking it with food.  Overall, the most effective pain medication I&#039;ve ever used.""",9
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I have suffered from generalized anxiety disorder for longer than I care to remember.  Went through too many anti-depressants that all failed.  I was told the Buspar was an &quot;oldie but goodie.&quot;  I was reluctant to even try another pill and was of the notion that drinking wine was going to be my alternate choice, (which I didn&#039;t care to start).  Buspar has been my answer.  It&#039;s brought calm into my life.  I recommend this &quot;magic pill.&quot;""",7
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am bipolar and I was not on a mood stabilizer, due to severe sensitivity to side effects. I take Klonopin 1 mg and Lamictal 150mg twice a day. I was taking Ambien for sleep, but now with the Saphris, I don&#039;t need any sleep medicines and I am so much more relaxed and not stressed out. I&#039;m very happy that I&#039;ve finally found something that is working. My mind has slowed down, deeper sleep modes and less stress reactions to people. I feel great. Not manic great, just great. I&#039;m thankful to my family for their support and standing by me in the rough times of the disease. My family is benefiting as well. I have to rate this as a 10. The taste is bad, but the cherry is helping. Much luck to all to try and see if it can help you too!""",6
Zoloft,Depression,"""My Healthcare Provider switched my 20mg daily dose of Lexapro to Zoloft. I was to completely stop Lexapro and begin Zoloft with a dose of 200 mg daily. 
That was 6 months ago. 
I am not having a good experience with Zoloft. My dosage was adjusted down over a period of 3 weeks to 50 mg. 
My mind was constantly whirling with anxiety, my mood was total chaos, swinging from depressed to mad. 
My alcohol consumption was increased both by quantity and frequency.
My appetite increased in the frequency of hunger and the amount of food I consume, but I never seem to hit the full feeling.
I am seesawing between 100 to 200 mg daily at this time, trying to totally stop Zoloft. 
Main reasons; weight gain (30lbs in 4 months ) &amp;  increased alcohol craving""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking this pill on 7/30/10. I&#039;m a 5&#039;4, 25 yr old female, my start weight was 144lbs. I&#039;ve been going to the gym, a minimum of 3 days a week (prior to the pills) 2-3 hr cardio classes. I was stuck on the same weight for a while, my eating habits aren&#039;t the greatest but not the unhealthiest either. I told my doctor that I had difficulties shaving off some pounds so she prescribed me the medication. During the first week or so I dropped 8lbs. I&#039;m at 136 lbs right now. My appetite has reduced immensely. I hardly desire to eat. I only eat small portions once or twice a day. The side effects that I have recently encountered for the past 3 days is a lot of dizziness (mostly when I stand up), light headed, some dry mouth (not too bad).""",3
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""I started taking this drug after trying many stimulants that didn&#039;t work.  For some reason ADHD stimulants just raise my blood pressure and make me feel crummy.  When I first started on Guanfacine 1mg for ADHD it was a life changing drug.  Like after taking it for a week you start asking yourself I wonder what my life would have been like had I found this drug sooner.  This drug helped me read, focus, and also helped with motivation, anxiety, and impulsiveness.  However after about 2 months all of the positive effects of this drug were gone.  I switched to Intuniv the extended release version because I read that it worked better.  It did not help and all I got was the side effects.  I gave this drug an 8 because it was great while it worked""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started Adipex-P nine months ago and I&#039;ve consistently lost weight. When I weighed in at the Dr.s today, I am down 20.6lbs since last month! I&#039;ve lost a total of 83lbs and was approved for my left knee replacement on Nov 18. When that heals, we do the other one. I have battled obesity my whole life- had gastroplasty (stomach stapling) back in the early 80s and I&#039;ve lost and gained hundred pounds during  time periods in my life and I&#039;ve got hope now that there may be a light at the end of the Tunnel.  When I get my knee joints in and get active I think I really might be able to get down to a decent weight and make it stick. I&#039;d like a second chance at life, to find a wife to spend my retirement years with. Staying Positive!""",3
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""This drug has been a lifesaver to me. It&#039;s helped provide me with mood stability with an antidepressant effect, whereas lithium only controlled the mania part of my mood. I use this in combination with other drugs  and so far there hasn&#039;t been any side effects. I tried decreasing the dosage, and within 2 days I noticed a difference in my mood. I would definitely recommend this drug. This has made a difference in my mood, the way I think, and my overall perspective. This improved my motivation to get work done, since I wouldn&#039;t be just sitting around reminiscing in a negative thought loop. It gives me mental freedom and allows me to escape brain fog that has imprisoned my thoughts. Seriously, don&#039;t be afraid to try this drug""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started these pills on 8/11/2017. I&#039;m 5&#039;3 and weighed 163. Today is 8/31 and I have managed to get down to 152lb. The first 3 days went kinda crazy. Not hungry at all but still ate small portions. To this day I do not crave any sweets, soda or fast food really at all. Which is nuts because I love all that junk! I have been eating very healthy too. Lots of greens and chicken for dinner. Fruit and fiber bar for breakfast. I have cheated a couple times but it&#039;s ok :) I do have more energy during the day. Only thing that sucks is that I have a desk job so its hard to get out. I go walk outside every chance I get. Only 11 pounds so far.  Overall I am pleased with this pill. I will continue to take it and repost in a month or so.""",3
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I am only on day 1, and took 1 pill this morning and 1 this afternoon (not knowing I was only suppose to take one daily for the first week)  I feel fine, although I fell asleep at work, I got extremely tired after my lunch meal(gumbo) and my legs feel like they need to be stretched every time I stand up. No dizziness and nausea as most have said. thankfully, and hopefully this works for me. 245weight, looking to drop 45lbs.""",3
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""Took depakote for almost ten years (300 x 3)...now I will admit I had three minor episodes in that time. Super, yes, I know but I started at 140 lbs in six months I bottomed out at 206lbs. I slept 12 hours a night, plus a nap of 2 hours in the evening. Someone finally caught the Depakote/Paxil fiasco, and lithium and wellbutrin became my friends...more importantly, I feel like I &quot;woke up&quot;. I lived the life, but it seemed so surreal looking back on it...IT completely controlled me. It&#039;s not the Wellbutrin and the Paxil, it&#039;s the lack of Depakote (and for a large part, Paxil) that made me almost another person. I&#039;m sure Depakote works for thousands of people...it just took me out of the equation TOO much.""",6
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I lost 13 pounds in 10 days. At first I was very excited because the weight was coming off extremely fast but my body caught on and the weight loss is slowing down. My appetite is suppressed and I have no desire for chocolate over a healthy salad. 
Side effects: On the second day of Qsymia, I noticed my Diet Coke taste like Diet Pepsi (I strongly prefer Diet Coke). In addition, I had the numbness / tingling in the face, feet, and hands. After five or so days, the tingling in the feet remains, but it is very noticeable at times (especially when lying down). About day seven, I started dealing with constipation. That may be contributed to the fact that I choose to eat healthy and foods without fats (to simulate movement).""",3
OxyContin,Pain,"""I am a 47 year old male who has taken this drug for 10 years. (300 mg per day everyday.)  Yes it will ease pain, but normally 2 to 3 years you have to increase it. I was medically dependent within months.  In late fall 09, the medicines just lost their effect by at least 50%.  So I was faced with a 50% increase in medicines.  I said NO!  So I tried a medical detox place to start.  After 90 hours there, they said you have done great we are sending you home.  I was so proud till 4a.m. the next day. I threw up 90 times in the next 60 hours.  I lost 34lbs. in 8 days and had severe withdrawal symptoms for 2 more weeks. It has been 30 days since I started this and I will never put that poison in my body. """,9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I cannot say enough positive things about Contrave. I started the end of June with the 1 pill and then 2 and so on and that first month I didnt see a difference really in my appetite. Once i got my second bottle and started on the full dose...drastic difference. I eat 1/4 of what I normally do portion wise...less snacks/meals a day. And most importantly i have NO desire to eat just to eat. I am not addicted to food anymore. I actually have to make myself eat. I am not a weigher because I obsess but since i started the full dose a lil over a month ago i have lost 26 inches all over. Everyone has noticed my weight loss...cashiers at stores even lol, its significant! Not to mention I am just happier in general!""",2
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""The jury is still out on Kyleena. Insertion day was 1 week ago. It was horrible!!! I took a Tramadol pain pill 45 min before insertion and I could still feel the pressure. I became nauseated 1 hr after insertion. I spent the next 4 hrs rolling in bed calling on the Lord to stop the pain. I vomited 4 times in a row after emptying everything out of my colon. Then I slept 3 hrs. Oh, I have bled everyday sense insertion!!!!""",8
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I began taking orlistat, Xenical 120mg three times a day with meals for the treatment of obesity. I am 18, female and weighed 21stone 9lbs as of 22/07/13. I have been taking the Xenical for just a week and have experienced very few side effects slightly more gastric distress (flatulence and the occasional oily excrement but that is as a result of my ignorance to food and fat) but I am delighted to find that after only a week I have lost 14pounds and now weigh 20stone 9lbs I appreciate that I am still overweight, but I have lost 1 stone and 9inches in total from various areas of my body and am extraordinarily surprised to find myself revealing in such success. """,2
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I had surgery for a colon resection. I can&#039;t take Hydrocodone because it upsets my stomach, gives me headaches, nausea and constipation. The morphine (patient administered pump) didn&#039;t work for me at all, but Dilaudid worked wonderfully, 2 mg every 6 hours. I had no unpleasant side effects, which is very unusual for me with any medicine. I had no withdrawal problems when I left the hospital. If I ever have surgery again, I&#039;m going to request Dilaudid. It gave me great relief and let me rest and heal!""",9
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""Thought this was a miracle drug for me. At first I was taking 5 mg a day twice a day with no side effects. NO SIDE EFFECTS, it was a dream!  Since I tried all the SSRIs with no luck, due to intolerable side effects I had very high hopes.  Once day six came around I started to feel the drug working more.  That night I came home after working two 12 hour shifts back to back,  and I had the worst insomnia of my life. I have NEVER EVER had trouble sleeping after my twelve hour shifts. I was up for almost 24 hours it was so bad and I was absolutely exhausted and miserable. Needless to say, I deemed the insomnia not worth taking this drug.""",7
Doryx,Acne,"""I started taking Doryx about 4 months ago for cystic acne. SO GLAD I DID. It took almost 2 months to see results but it was definitely worth the wait. It doesn&#039;t bother me to leave the house now without makeup. Occasionally I&#039;ll still get cysts but they only last a couple of days or so and it&#039;s usually around the time of my period. 

I do notice though that it makes me thirsty and it dries my skin/chaps my lips. But it&#039;s totally worth it. Just be patient! I almost gave up after the first month. I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t.""",4
Ativan,Anxiety,"""Most subtle of the benzos i have tried.  Made me sleepy the first hour or two, but then stabilized anxiety and mood for about 6 hours.  Much longer lasting than it is given credit for.  Good PRN medication.  Other benzos cause some moodiness or depression even.  Although I think Lorazepam can, it is much smoother than others.  It again is too sedating for many people though.  I liked it about as good as Clonazepam, it is better than Valium IMO.""",7
Lexapro,Depression,"""About 5 years ago I noticed that I was getting extremely upset over little things. I talked to my doctor about it and we decided it was most likely depression causing the erratic moods and sleeplessness. She put me on Lexapro. The first 2 weeks were great but then the side effects were too much. I felt like I was on a roller coaster and when I got upset, I would be filled with rage. I had to stop taking it and switched to Zoloft. I like it but now I am looking for something else because I just don&#039;t feel like I am living life just cruizing through it.""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I started off on 20mg and it did not work very well. I was very angry and still very distracted. Although i felt like that was the first time I&#039;ve ever been actually able to focus on daily activities. Things peaked my interest more resulting in more productive energy. Due to my short temper when I started, my doctor prescribed me to Ritalin and that was THEE WORST experience of my life. After that, we tried Strattera which was even worse. I&#039;d get sick to my stomach and just feel so drugged up. After a few different dosages she prescribed 30mg of vyvanse. I&#039;ve never felt so productive and aware. I havent ever realized before this, how many impulsive decisions I make without thinking about the effects. Vyvanse has made me more self aware.""",1
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking lithium bicarbonate for a little over 2 years. My dosage has fluctuated because I am also medicated for manic depression. I am 37 and have been medicated, on and off, for depression since I was 18. Lithium seems to help with my bipolar symptoms, not so much for my depression. My side effects have been: increased thirst, tremors, weight loss &amp; occasional stomach aches if I do not eat enough when I take my pills. I am fine with these so long as I feel &#039;normal.&#039;  Frequent blood work is not bothersome as I understand they are screening for my own health...lithium toxicity levels, kidney functions, thyroid activity.""",6
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I took Adipex (37.5) from February 2012-April 2012 and in that span of time I went from 300 lbs down to 170 lbs. That is a loss of 130 lbs. I hardly ate  anything but grilled chicken, fruit, and powerade. I walked at least 2 miles everyday. I got Pregnant at the end May 2012 so I had to stop taking it. My baby is now 2 years and 5 months and my weight has gone back up to a very uncomfortable 240 lbs. I still exercise regularly but not as often as I should. I have an appointment in 3 weeks to get adipex again and I am hoping and praying that I have the same results as before. This is a great aid in loosing weight for anybody who struggles with loosing weight by diet alone. Wish me luck...will update in 90 days!!!""",2
Dexedrine,ADHD,"""Was switched from Adderall XR to generic Dexedrine. I got an ineffective brand of Adderall (yes, some brands are better than others). The positive effects were gone and the negative effects were enhanced. My blood pressure was great, around 102-117 systolic and 75-85 diastolic but my pulse was way too high 110-130. For the most part I loved Dexedrine, it worked very well and without the L-Amphetamine in Adderall my pulse rate was good 85-102. My only complaint was that the length of time it worked was inconsistent. Some days it would last 45 min other days it would last 2 hours. After speaking to my psych doc we decided to switch to Vyvanse instead of having to take 3 or 4 Dexedrine pills a day. Other than length of duration this is great.""",1
Tramadol,Anxiety,"""Several yrs ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder.  Had back surgery a couple yrs back and was prescribed Tramadol for pain. Turns out Tramadol (50-100 mg/day) works great for anxiety for me. If you take it for anxiety, make sure if asked that you say it is prescribed for pain as well. Several pharmacists tell me if you say it&#039;s for anxiety only, they &quot;have&quot; to report you and your MD and you both may be arrested. Not sure if the pharms are right, but if they are, it appears this is another case where a few abusers screw it up for the rest of us. It was not on the controlled substance list until very recently. In any event in my experience Tramadol is very effective to treat anxiety disorder.""",7
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I have been on Straterra for about two months.  It certainly has a subtle affect that creeps up on you. It is not a stimulant so does not have that quick hit affect.  While taking it I feel a little dopey... but if I have been on it for a while and then lower the dose to one every two days. I can really feel the difference in my performance and focus.

I went through a stressful experience which brought on some mania.  Stay off this medicine if you go through a similar experience.  It heightens panic and intensifies anxiety.

Other then that seems to be good.""",1
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Been taking Victoza since June.The beginning was kind a tired some, body aches, and major constipation and nausea. After a while all but the constipation went away. Started at 0.6 gradually increased to 1.2 then after a month was told to increase gradually to 1.8 which was so not good because once I increased I notice a change that cause me to crave. So I Reduced my dosage back to 1.2 and I Feel Amazing little to no appetite at all. Weight loss has been a Success down 22lbs  within 3 months and still have 28 more to go, so overall the Pen is amazing. I Will go in in 2 weeks to get my Pancreas Check just to make sure no damage or anything has been taken place within these last 3 months.""",2
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I was just diagnosed ADD by the Quotient test - I have always been successful but lazy and the kind of guy who always did the bare minimum but managed to squeak through life (school and work).  Fortunately I am an entrepreneur and have employees because I do not feel I could have ever held down a job. I have been taking Vyvanse for a week and my entire life has changed - I am getting my work done, I am happier, have less stress and anxiety about not getting things done and for the first time in my life I am able to sit and accomplish a task without getting frustrated, distracted and putting things off.  AMAZING!""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""We switched on the advice of the then new ADHD therapist.  It took longer to &quot;kick in&quot; and build up than other meds we tried but it has been a God send.  His grades are WAY up and he&#039;s not as hot or cold as he used to be.  My only issues are he won&#039;t eat while on it...not even a tiny bite.  Dr is keeping an eye on the weight.  Also, to me, he&#039;s not himself.  I don&#039;t like the flatness because his personality is so big!  At least it wears off!""",1
Tranylcypromine,Depression,"""I have found that people around me say that I have improved  and seem better yet, inside I still feel like I&#039;m in a deep dark hole. I&#039;ve only been on 40mg for 3 months however. 

As for increased sex drive!?! When does that happen? It&#039;s killed my sex life. 

Have lost a lot of weight due to food restrictions, but needed to shed a few kilos.

 I also find it messes with my bladder. Anyone else have this issue? Some days I can pee no problems, others, it&#039;s just painful and I struggle to pass urine even when busting to go! 

Though after reading others stories, it gives me hope, that this drug, will bring me out of the darkness...... As I&#039;m really over being in here. (I had a nervous breakdown).""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am about to be on week 2 of contrave. I have cut out all caffeinated beverages and sticking to a low fat/low cal diet and I am down 6 pounds! The first day was complete torture due to the nausea, headache and vertigo but I am determined to not quit and be successful at this! I want to be able to feel as though I can do anything, go anywhere and not have my weight dictate my path in life. I am 5ft 9 and weighed 262 and again on day 7, I am at 257! Just waiting on my scale now! Good luck everyone and don&#039;t get discouraged!!""",2
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I couldn&#039;t understand where all this bloating was coming from. Along with joint pain and blurred vision since my hypertension has been treated and under cover for years.  Well, I found out that the generic version of venlafaxine ER included a hydrochloride extended release that was also in the brand.  Thought I was in menopause - but I&#039;m not.  The increase in my blood pressure is causing quite a bit of other problems.  I don&#039;t know which is worse, uncontrollable hypertension with complications for my thyroid medicine because of the iodine from the sodium or the depression from the hypothyroidism.  Either way - my doctor is working on the problem because I just can&#039;t take myself off my medicines.""",5
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Update from my 3/5/17 post. 
So it has been one week since I started Contrave.  I have lost 9 lbs and I am very happy!  I am not craving sweets or junk food at all. My energy level is good although I haven&#039;t started any exercise yet, waiting until upper respiratory  infection is completely gone.( nothing to do with Contrave). 
Making sure to drink a lot of water everyday.  After day 4, had some constipation  issues but I just added some prunes to my oatmeal, and problem solved.  Definitely eating smaller amounts of good food because my mind is telling me I&#039;m done. I like that a lot!
Today I will begin taking 2. Hoping things remain the same, I&#039;m a little nervous reading the side effects that some others are having after increasing dose.""",3
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had periods of insomnia for most of my life, they worsen when I am anxious/depressed. I started to take this about four months ago and I have been very happy with the results. I take it at night, about 1.5 hours before I want to sleep, sometimes two hours depending on how much coffee I have had during the day or how anxious I am feeling. This medication does not &#039;zonk&#039; me out like most sleeping pills (it is not a sleeping pill), but my doctor thought it would work well for me without the side effects. I really never have any side effects unless I take the med too late, and then I find it a bit hard to get out of bed). I think it helps with my anxiety too, maybe that is because I am sleeping better. I take cipralex during too.""",0
Concerta,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 15 year old girl who started off with Vyvanse for a year but became anorexic. I switched off to Concerta! The first couple of years I felt so amazing because I have never experienced what it felt like to succeed after trying so much. Then I got to High School. My meds ended a relationship. I was always paranoid and extremely nervous. I am like a robot now. I&#039;m either extremely emotionless, really mad, or really paranoid. My friends tell me that it&#039;s like talking to a stranger. I get frustrated so easily and don&#039;t care about anyone or anything around me. I don&#039;t want to be taken off my meds because I&#039;m really successful. But should I really have to choose between my loved ones and school. I shouldn&#039;t have to pick.""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I have taken Adderall XR and Vyvanse. They both have a similar but not completely similar feeling when it comes to getting work done. But mainly my experience with Vyvance is quite good but not great. I take whenever I get up to go to school (6-6:30), and it takes an hour to kick in. I have been taking Vyvance for the last 4 years. It helps you focus a lot more than usual and it gives you the motivation to get work done. But the downside about it is that you feel depressed for a minute or anxiety, but after a couple of minutes you feel back motivated and happy. Also, I love that it gives you the mind clarity that I personally think everyone needs. Overall, my experience with Vyvance Is awesome. Btw I&#039;m 15""",1
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD very late in life, at 55. My main symptoms are depression, anxiety, insomnia, lack of motivation/energy and a raft of others. I have tried every anti-depressant available, most of which didn&#039;t work or the side effects were too bad. 
I always seem to have to take high doses of medication, and ended up on 120mg of Strattera. It didn&#039;t do much for my concentration or cognitive symptoms, but after a few months I noticed my motivation getting better. However, it caused my quite severe cardiac symptoms and the dose was dropped to 100mg. I needed to think straight, so Methylphenidate was added. This was a great combination for me, apart from the side effects which often go away given time, but in my case didn&#039;t.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been taking this medication for approximately l month  and have lost  23 pounds.  Have not had to take the tablet at night because I am not hungry.  I do have a little more energy but am having trouble with sleep.  It did cause me to have severe constipation.  My doctor told me to take pericolace. It is very expensive so I bought the cheaper equivalent.  I take one in the AM and 1 in the PM.  I take a bundle of medications which also cause constipation, tiredness, sleepiness, drowsiness.  So, I don&#039;t think the Contrave is  the problem, but it did add to it. I do forget to eat and am worried about getting enough protein. So, I bought ENSURE.  I seem to have more energy and forget to eat because I am not hungry.""",2
Celecoxib,Pain,"""If Celebrex ever falls to the legislative chopping block I will be the first in line in Washington to keep Celebrex available.
If I had to eliminate all but one of the fifteen (I don&#039;t believe it myself) medications I am currently taking then the keeper would be Celebrex.
I&#039;ve suffered from chronic pain and fatigue for over fifteen years now. After going through the roster of pain killers Celebrex was like a godsend. Instead of a massive area of pain that ran through my head, down through my neck and into my shoulder blades and upper arms I found that I had half a dozen distinct areas of pain consistent with the areas of damage from accidents and injuries.
I have no side effects with the two 200mg taken twelve hours apart.""",9
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Just been prescribed these as I have just had a manic episode with anxiety and insomnia. At first I was frightened to take them and had the prescription sitting for two weeks, the gp said getting some sleep will help with recovery. These definitely knock you out at 15mg. This is the third night and I feel rested although drugged throughout the day, having some amazing dreams.All my body feels calm and just relaxed which is an absolute godsend after the last few weeks. There is no way I could drive so I will have to contact the doc as I won&#039;t be able to take these when I go back to work. I developed a bad reaction to sertraline which I had taken for a couple of years, alongside lamotrigine and quetiapine for bipolar. I would recommend these.""",0
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Everyone&#039;s different and some folks won&#039;t need the 20 mg a day. This medicine makes you feel like you never had an issue with cravings. They are gone, 100%,. After a while you forget what it was to have cravings and you may think the medicine isn&#039;t really doing anything, but try skipping it for a day or two and it will all come back to you! I still want to eat, just not bad stuff or big portions. I get hungry, but never so much so that I can&#039;t make good choices. That&#039;s the beauty of it. I think it will have to be made available for maintenance, maybe a lower dose, not sure. I wish more doctors knew about it. So many people are missing out on something that could really help them.""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""My experience was this. I was practically dying. My body was giving up. My blood pressure was 205. Pre-diabetic. LDL off-the-charts. I had joint pain, could not concentrate, acid reflex, headaches constantly to migraines, could not sleep, in dead of winter I was always too hot, would walk outside at 2am in shorts just to cool down, snoring, could not get any complete rest, and many more. I found this YT site from a Dr. William Davies, Wheat Belly. I instantly decided to quit eating ALL wheat and grains. You will be happy you did. Then I went on Phentermine 37.5mg. I was 315. Since 1/15 to 5/12, I have lost 60 pounds. I&#039;m still losing. You will find out that you need to drink lots of water because it will be difficult to urinate.""",2
Mirena,Birth Control,"""DON&#039;T GET THE MIRENA IUD. I wanted to love the Mirena, I really did. I&#039;m 23, no kids &amp; wanted a low maintaince birth control. Insertion &amp; initial cramping were pretty bad but thats normal. I liked my IUD for the first year or so. Didn&#039;t gain weight like I did on the pill &amp; no real side effects. But my love for the IUD turned to hatred when I discovered it had given me an OVARIAN CYST. I started having an excruciating pain deep in my abdomen. The pain was right next to my hip bone and was unlike ANY pain I&#039;ve ever had. It would radiate down my leg &amp; up my back. Some days I couldn&#039;t even stand up or go to work. Finally got an ultrasound and discovered it was a cyst so now its out and I feel SO much better. Please don&#039;t get the Mirena!!""",8
Celexa,Depression,"""I have been taking citalopram 60mg for about 3 years.
At first it was working great, I was smiling more and laughing from the bottom of my stomach instead of just my throat. Now though I feel like it has completely stopped working. I have mood swings, anxiety, fears, not sleeping, waking up before dawn, etc. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me or is my medicine telling me it need&#039;s a change. What else can I try? I need my life back, my children need me.""",5
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I absolutely love it! And by the way its the only medication for insomnia that is approved by the FDA to be taken long term. I&#039;ve tried Ambien, temazepam, trazodone, OTC sleep aids, valerian, melatonin, EVERYTHING; and nothing else has ever came close to helping me sleep like Lunesta does. The only problem which really sucks is my insurance wont pay for Lunesta so if I want it I have to pay cash and its ridiculously expensive!""",0
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had insomnia since I was 14, I&#039;m 35 now. My insomnia stems from abuse as a child which led to PTSD. When I was about 23 I was diagnosed as bi-polar. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever really slept like a normal person. I&#039;ve been on so many different sleep aids. I have had 2 sleep studies, the most recent confirmed that I don&#039;t have sleep apnea but that I don&#039;t have normal sleep. I started Clonazepam a couple weeks ago after the combination of ativan 2mg and amitriptyline 300 mg stopped working. My doctor started me at 0.5mgs I took it for 2 weeks and it had no effect on me, so she raised it to 1mg and I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m supposed to feel but I&#039;m definitely not tired, I&#039;m up till 3 or 4 in the morning. It&#039;s honestly one of the most frustrating things.""",0
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 16. I was prescribed 36mg Comcentra  I took it at 8:30pm (was suppose to take it in morning) it worksd it helped me focus but 3 hours into it I started feeling anxiety and later I had a crash. Couldn&#039;t sleep stayed up the whole entire night. I also has many other side effects like lack of appitite and heavy breathing might be to large of a dose but overall without the crazy side effects it helped me get stuff done and concentrate""",1
Cariprazine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This is my second post, I was waiting for my insurance to approve this med....been on samples starting at 1.5, then to 3mg, and now 4.5mg, other then a little bit of restlessness, I am tolerating this med quite well (after trying over 40 other meds) it has been 2 months since I began taking it, and at least some of the suicidal thoughts have dissipated...I will continue to take it, and work up to 6mg starting next month....but by far, one of the best Bipolar meds I have tried in over 9 years!""",6
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""Took for 2 years. Seemed to help with GAD after a month or so, and was taking in conjunction with alprazolam. VERY expensive med, so I strongly suggest finding a prescription discount card or coupon ($41 was the cheapest I ever paid-WITH my insurance it was $75)!  Do NOT miss a dose or you will get what I call &quot;zilches&quot; (feels like a painless yet bothersome &amp; annoying electrical shock feeling from your shoulders to your fingertips). After I stopped taking it because I just couldn&#039;t afford it, and it didn&#039;t seem to be helping anymore, it took about a month for the &quot;zilches&quot; to go away. Again, they&#039;re not painful, just a very weird feeling. also caused some weight gain. Starting Effexor ER tomorrow, so we&#039;ll see how that goes.""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been taking contrive since August 18th and today is December 4th and I have have had great success. If you feel a little funny for the first week or two it is totally normal. Just a tiny bity jittery and a little constipation at first. It is all gone now. I originally started at 305 pounds and was able to get down to 275 pounds on my own. It took me a long time to loose my first 30 pounds, 6 months to be precise, I began to get discouraged. After talking to my doctor he thought I would do well on contrave. With contrive I have lost 40 pounds in less then 4 months. I don&#039;t have any side effects and I feel great! This medicine is changing my life and I am so grateful to have found it!""",2
Oxazepam,Anxiety,"""I have to admit when I was first perscribed this medication, I was very hesitant to take it. Like with all medications, I didn&#039;t know how this would effect me. And asking doctors and nurses, I still wasn&#039;t sure. After the first time I took it, I felt better than I have had in a long time. I was calm and very relaxed. I had a small headache, that felt like a mild hangover, but that was the only side effect I had. I highly recommend this medicine.""",7
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""My experience is limited since I have only been on this medication for a few days.  I am a medical resident, diagnosed with ADHD at 32. Got sick and tired of my mediocre performance at work. Tried Straterra, Viibryd and Wellbutrin, nothing worked. Just started on Dexedrine 5mg 2-3 times a day. My first day on it, I studied all day until midnight. I was so motivated, I felt great, on top of the world, I was so driven. I noticed an immediate difference in my performance at work and it made me a nicer, less cynical. The bad thing was insomnia, teeth clenching, some nausea, decreased appetite and the drop in my mood once it wore off. I am worried about intolerance which is driving up my anxiety level. """,1
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""My nurse practioner kept insisting I try Prozac along with Olanzapine for my severe bipolar depression because it was the gold standard (supposedly they work good together). So, I ended up taking Prozac all the way up to 60 mg for over 12 weeks (along with Carbamazepine, Olanzapine &amp; now Saphris) and I only got a partial response to the medicine. It helped get me functioning again but I wasnt happy. I still didnt enjoy the things I loved doing. For example, I would try listening to music or play video games but it wouldnt do anything for me. The euphoria was kind of missing. I know 80 mg is the max dosage but I shouldnt have to be on the max dosage or go beyond it to get a desired effect. Oh, and I lost my sex drive on Prozac too! Grr!""",5
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""It WORKS! I&#039;m at the end of my first week on Belviq, and I have lost 8lbs. I&#039;ve also been eating healthier with weight watchers and walking a couple times a week.  It don&#039;t have any side effects I&#039;ve noticed and it makes me not even care about food. It&#039;s a miracle pill. I eat when my belly tells me too, not nearly as much as I was..when I do eat I&#039;m full enough to last quite honestly till the next day. It&#039;s really wonderful and I highly recommend it.""",3
Adderall,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 31yr old female, 5&#039;4, 115lbs.

Without it I could sleep 18hrs for days &amp; still be wanting 2 sleep an hr or so after getting up! I can sleep while taking it, but don&#039;t have the strong compulsion to. The first day taking it I&#039;ve learned 2 only take half bc if not it feels like I&#039;m on cocaine, even after just a week of not having it. But the 2nd day &amp; thereafter is fine.I  never experiencd any &quot;comedown&quot; like some ppl. The only negative is without it I get agitated easily &amp; get on my own nerves when it comes 2 lack of concentration, forgetfulness,n sleeping 2 much.""",1
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""Latuda changed my life. I feel normal. I&#039;m 48 years old and have been on many, many different types of meds for Bipolar type 1. I was diagnosed when I was 28, and have had quite a roller coaster time until I was put on Latuda 80 mg as well as Wellbutrin XL 300. I also had to add Trazodone 100mg later for sleeping. It&#039;s been 3 1/2 years now and I&#039;m married now and taking care of both of my daughters, my grandson, and my husband. It truly has changed my life to stable and normal.""",6
Oxycodone,Pain,"""To keep this within limits I will not get detailed on the benefits of Oxycontin. As you can read on the other forums it works. I take 80mg 3x a day and it works great. Been on it for 5 years now and liver test done last month was excellent. I am tired of the bad rap this medicine gets though. There are even sites devoted to its removal by people who have lost loved ones who abused the drug. While I feel for these people, no one told anyone abuse this wonderful drug. When taken properly this medicine works excellent with little to no side effects. It is said that you become dependent on this medicine but it is meant for long term and a good doctor will bring you down properly. So withdrawals should be minimum. This is a true wonder drug.""",9
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""For 10 years I took a 50 mg of Diphenhydramine at bedtime.  It helped me to get to sleep most of the time.  Then it stopped working.  Now I take Trazodone and it works much better.   My initial dose was 100 mg and I slept fitfully with mild hallucinations.  I decreased the dose to 50 mg and slept much better with some dreams all pleasant and no nightmares.  Now I take 25 mg at bedtime, and another 12.5 mg (1/4 pill) if I wake up during the night.  I&#039;ve been on this regimen for three months and have not had any side effects; I wake up refreshed and don&#039;t feel sleepy in the mornings.""",0
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been taking Vyvanse for about a year now and it has been an interesting trip. At first I couldn&#039;t sleep for the life of me and would go days on only a couple hours of sleep that I could get. Then after a couple months I was able to sleep almost like I used to and I noticed that I was more mentally alert and energetic but, my appetite dramatically diminished to almost nothing and still felt like my body wasn&#039;t getting enough rest. On top of that, when I would skip a dose I would have EXTREME hunger where I couldn&#039;t eat enough and I would have terrible fatigue! After a year everything evened out and began to feel normal other than having no appetite, but I have a healthy food schedule so I don&#039;t forget to eat. I would also like to say that I think it should NOT be recommended for children!""",1
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I have had severe anxiety for a couple of years. My attacks get so bad, I feel I need to run as far away as I can. Taking Lorazepam 3mg a day has been a tremendous help. I have read comments about going off the medicine and the difficult withdrawls, but if something works in your personal lifestyle where nothing else has, why shouldn&#039;t you be able to stay on this medication as long as you need it? It&#039;s like high blood pressure. If you have it and can&#039;t get it under control, medications are key. No one starts telling you that you should stop the medication.
For some, Lorazepam is a lifesaver. Maybe not for everyone, but for me, in my situation it is.""",7
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Adipex 37.5 on May 29th, my first time taking this medication but I can&#039;t seem to lose any of my weight gained from my second pregnancy. I tried dieting, exercising and nothing happened. My current weight when I started was 248 and the first day taking this I felt like If I started moving I wouldn&#039;t be able to stop. The energy it provides was amazing. So far the only side effects I&#039;ve had was dry mouth. Starting to get a little constipated but I knew that was a possibility so I&#039;m prepared for it.  I weighed myself today and I&#039;m down to 241. I haven&#039;t changed my eating habits and I try to stay active for at least 30 minutes a day. I&#039;m hoping to lose between 50-70lbs.""",3
Neurontin,Pain,"""I had a work accident over a year ago. I have taken every pain medicine, had the spinal shots therapy. Now I&#039;m taking this and have virtually no pain. However, if/when you are taking this, be careful - about 2-4 hours after taking it, you will feel extremely drunk or high for a while. Don&#039;t drive on this stuff. But overall, it has worked better than all the other medicines I have been on.""",9
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""Awful stuff. If you have ever suffered with depression do not use this because it will make you very depressed - they don&#039;t tell you this. mood swings have been awful from angry to crying to anxious. I&#039;m like a psycho on it. constant headaches, tiredness, stomach cramps, heartburn, feel dizzy and weak, nausea.. and the hunger! Omg the hunger.. I constantly feel like I haven&#039;t eaten for a week and even after eating a meal I still have hunger pain. The only good thing it&#039;s done for me (except prevent pregnancy) is I am losing weight even though I&#039;m eating more because of the constant hunger. It seems to have made my metabolism go crazy. I&#039;ve lost 5 pounds in the 4 weeks since I had the injection. Majority of people gain weight though I read.""",8
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I just got my Skyla inserted a few hours ago. It was quick, less than five minutes. I&#039;ve never had a child before, but I was on my period. I did not experience any pain. The cramps people talk about is just your body&#039;s reaction to your uterus being poked. It&#039;s weird and a little uncomfortable, but only for a minute. I took pain medicine beforehand, and have not had any cramping. Overall it was quick, and painless. Don&#039;t let any horror stories stop you from trying it out, you can always tell your doctor to stop if you feel pain. Everyone&#039;s body is different.""",8
Pristiq,Depression,"""I&#039;ve suffered severe depression for the last 20 years. I&#039;ve been on Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Effexor, Celexa, Cymbalta and Lexapro. My neurologist prescribed Pristiq 2 months ago. I recently told her at my follow-up visit, &quot;For the first time in 20 years, life doesn&#039;t suck.&quot; I wake up in the morning well-rested. My mind is clear. When I go to bed at night, I&#039;m actually tired (no more insomnia!) and I sleep really well. I used to be a stress eater; now I only eat when it&#039;s meal time and have less of an appetite. The only negative side effect for me has been constipation, but it&#039;s manageable. I had pretty much given up any kind of hope that feeling better was possible. I&#039;m glad I was wrong!""",5
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Although reading the possible side effects can be scary, this medicine gave me my life back. I had a little hair loss, at doses above 1000mg, but it&#039;s been great in stabilizing my mood swings. If I go off of it, I have an episode within a month. I had no weight gain (actually lost weight I had gained from taking Seroquel previously). I take it with Wellbutrin SR and a little Abilify.  But the Depakote is by far the most effective. I&#039;ve been on it for over 3 years.""",6
Zoloft,Depression,"""Started sertraline at 25mg and have slowly increased to 200mg daily over a period of 9 months. My depression is totally gone, but have continued to battle general anxiety and a little social anxiety.  Just increased to 200 mg this week and have my fingers crossed!  I also take 1 mg Klonopin daily. I&#039;m a 55 year old female and as I look back over my life, I can see that I&#039;ve always had anxiety issues. Zoloft has been a tremendous help for me!""",5
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have PTSD as a result of the 1968 TET offensive.  It got much worse after I retired.  A good night&#039;s sleep became 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep.  VA had me on Prozac which did nothing for the sleep but helped in my awake hours.  Then I was given Trazadone 50 mg and told to split it in half 1 hour before bed.  I was also told not to increase the dose, but cutting in half again,may help.  I did this and now sleep the night getting 6 to 7 hours with only one short break.  Dreams are back after becoming all but nonexistant other than flashbacks.  My life is greatly improved.""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been using victoza then switched to saxenda. Been on saxenda for months.  Have continued to gain weight, not lose.  I am on 3.0 saxenda .  Was on qsymia prior to victoza, and lost about 25-30 lbs, until my insurance deemed it a diet drug and now won&#039;t pay for it! Any thoughts would be appreciated very much. I feel like a big whale, especially around my middle area. I want my qysimia back, but it is expensive and cannot get my pcp or endocrinologist--who prescribed it in the past- to prescribe it now due to being termed weight loss drug. My A1c went down a lot on qysimia as well.  Topamax  didn&#039;t work by itself as I have tried that too!!  I want my qysimia back!!""",2
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I felt more emotionally stable on this, meaning when I would have usually gotten to a certain point, the medication stopped it before it could escalate. For the first few months I was thankful for not completely crashing and burning every couple of weeks (I was in a particularly stressful situation in the period of time I was taking this so my hopelessness was exasperated), significant reduction in hallucinations and paranoid delusions, not being able to cry, sleeping consistently and having no memory of my dreams. The reasons as to why I stopped taking it were degenerated eyesight (my eyesight had been perfect prior to meds), severely effected long and short term memory and zero motivation in all areas of life. I didn&#039;t feel like myself.""",6
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I started taking this after having missed four periods. I started taking this on Tuesday and by Thursday I started my period. The horrible cystic acne I was suffering from disappeared and the unwanted hair growth stopped and reversed course. The joint pain I see people commenting on may not be from this pill. Have your physician test your DHEA and prolactin levels through blood work as deficiencies in these areas can cause severe joint pain, fatigue, memory loss, decreased libido and hair loss.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I need to lose 30 lbs. I tried every thing, even the HCG diet. I was so hungry on that diet, it made me gain more weight. I tried phentermine 37.5 mg 7 days ago, and I am down 5 lbs. the first day I took it, I didn&#039;t eat all day long. It was weird and scary at the same time. I just wasn&#039;t hungry at all. My energy level was at the highest I ever felt. I had to keep moving. The next day, my body started getting use to the pill. I don&#039;t night snack any more. My last meal is around 7pm. If I start exercising I will probably lose more weight faster. side effects: thirsty all the time, but that helps me to get my 8 glasses of water intake. Sometimes I feel kind of emotional. that&#039;s about it.""",3
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""Being un-diagnosed bi-polar for almost 40 years having many manic breaks until one was so big I wound up hospitalized.  I was put on Topamax, Prozac and Lunesta. With a Bi-Polar type II diagnosis I had to change my lifestyle.  Already in recovery I approached mental health in the same way.Topamax soon wasn&#039;t enough so my doc tried Latuda and it didn&#039;t work. Depakote is working great I am finally myself! Yes it makes me hungry I just keep my calorie count the same. The med doesn&#039;t cause weight gain -  my decisions do. With how well it works I&#039;d take some curves and feel this awesome any day!!""",6
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""So far I am not impressed.  On the first day I had a dizzy headache, but from the second day on I have had no bad symptoms at all.  That&#039;s the good news!  The bad news is I have been on Belviq for 6 days and I have GAINED 1 pound each day I have been using it!!  On the first day I cut down all portions, ate a salad or small cup of soup for lunch and a smaller portion of dinner--yet each morning I have gained a pound.  It is absurd!  I plan to take the full regimen of pills I bought (and what a bill that was!!), but I don&#039;t know if I will make it to my next doctor&#039;s appointment in 3 months with good news.  I have not been hungry at all, so you&#039;d think the weight would at least stay the same or go down.  Very depressed.. :-(""",3
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Like most people, I was extremely nervous about the procedure to get this birth control inserted. However, I was so done having to take an oral contraceptive everyday and just wanted something that was less of a hassle. After discussing different options with my OBGYN, we decided on NEXPLANON. It only took a week from talking with my doctor before the actual procedure. I had watched multiple youtube videos on the process and was extremely nervous. My doctor did an excellent job talking me through everything he did and I honestly didn&#039;t feel a thing. It was so quick and easy! I didn&#039;t have any bruising or side effects after the insertion. Its been a little over a month and nothing! Its awesome.""",8
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""Started on Jan16th 2017 and today is Feb 8th 2017 so far I&#039;ve lost 11 pounds but I have skipped days which is about once a week and on my period days. Start weight was 200 and today I weigh 189. I workout out at least twice a week based on my busy schedule. The pill works great on my appetite and keeps me drinking water a gallon a day. I barely consume enough calories usually about 500 to 800 a day and I&#039;ve noticed on my cheat days I end up losing more the next day. I need more motivation to get to my goal weight. Wish me luck ! 25 year old female 5&#039;2""",3
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""I received my first shot in March 2016 after being on the pill for 5 years. At first I loved the shot. I didn&#039;t have to worry about taking it at a set time every day (which I was terrible at) and my period has completely gone away. About a week before I was due for the second shot, I noticed an increase in my acne on my face, chest, and back as well as some spotting. That was the first week of June 2016 and I haven&#039;t stopped spotting since. My acne has also gotten significantly worse and I have never struggled with acne like this before in my life - even as a teenager. My stress level has increased significantly and I&#039;ve gained over 20 pounds since June 2016. I will NOT be going back in November to get my 4th shot.""",8
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have taken Latuda for about 2 weeks for Bipolar Depression. I also take Prozac and Depakote. I have never had a medicine work so quickly and dramatically. I can feel again...love for my family...optimism...although I am not sleeping as I did before. I have gone from 12-13 hours/night to 6-8 hours/night. I have had brief episodes of irritability but so far have been able to resolve them quickly. I feel better than I have in years.""",6
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""This is awful. I&#039;ve been on this for two years. Every thing was ok the first couple months but then it caused severe depression and I mean full blown suicidal thoughts on a daily basis for honestly no reason at all. No huge life changes just same old same old when the depression started. Also the bleeding, my God, the bleeding is endless. I can&#039;t with 100% accuracy say it&#039;s effective because of the zero desire to even have sex, which could be because of the endless bleeding.  I went from very sexually active to nothing almost immediately after having it put in. I&#039;m having it taken out early and DO NOT recommend this to anybody!!! There&#039;s got to be something better out there.""",8
Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,"""I took this from age 16 to 27, when I got married. Now I&#039;m 36, and my husband and I have tried for 10 years and I can&#039;t get pregnant. My periods have been torture since I quit taking it. It is nothing unusual for me hurt so bad within the first 48 hours of starting my period, I wind up passing out on my cold tile floor naked in a puddle of sweat. I&#039;ve spent a fortune trying to get pregnant, or at least find some reason behind the crippling effects of my period, which comes every 18 to 21 days. Maybe ortho isn&#039;t to blame, but I can&#039;t help but wonder if my inability to have a child is related in some way.""",8
Vraylar,Bipolar Disorde,"""A couple of weeks after taking Vraylar I started noticing that (as having Bipolar 2) my moods weren&#039;t really changing. Finally, sometime near the third week, I started noticing that I was pacing, couldn&#039;t seem to concentrate on anything, and had a hard time simply sitting down. I realized that it was making me manic. I DO NOT AT ALL would want anyone else to take this if anyone notices these side effects. I am going to stop it immediately, I nearly had a breakdown. Could not stop crying. Also going to talk to my doctor about it, but I can&#039;t continue it. I wasn&#039;t even paying for it because I was taking a sampler, and my doctor was going to give me a voucher to see if my insurance would take it.""",6
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I was put on Amitriptyline 10mg to help with severe back pain and trapped sciatic nerve affectng the lower right leg very badly. Had to stop driving.  I started to sleep extremely well but had not really had much pain to cope with at night so there was nothing special to note there. Daytime pain seemed unchanged until about 5 to 6 weeks into the course I did notice that daytime pain had lessened.  However I also noticed that in weeks 6 to 7, I was feeling extremely low, depressed, lifeless and started to have dull headaches, reread the side effects and decided to stop the drug immediately. I am a different person, feeling so much more alive and for me, the drug caused an effect more serious than the back and leg pain.""",9
Tretinoin,Acne,"""At age 36, my acne started to come back after a stressful time. It was concentrated on my chin, and was relentless. New cysts every single day. My doctor prescribed Tretinoin cream plus an oral antibiotic (doxycycline). I was so nervous about starting because I read so much about it getting worse before it got better. But to my amazement, after just a few days I started to see drastic improvement. Not a single new pimple, the existing ones healed quickly, and scars are fading fast. I&#039;m shocked (and extremely happy!) at how well this worked for me.""",4
Gabapentin,Pain,"""My doctors keep pushing this drug on me. Doesn&#039;t do a thing. I have osteoarthritis in my left knee after being assigned to USMC units for a number of years as a Navy Corpsman. Carrying over 80 lbs of gear on your back not including weapon, flak and Kevlar. Doin multiple humps and running like the wind has taken it&#039;s toll. But this drug does not work for me. The only thing it does is make me tired.""",9
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Second day taken Contrave. First day I had some nausea, my mouth started to get watery which for me indicates that I&#039;m about to throw up, mild cramps in my stomach but the stomach cramps soon went away after 20m. Sleepiness and tired. My head felt like it was heavy and my jaws felt tight after a while. I felt calmer than normal and somewhat high as if I took one puff of marijuana. My mouth was dry so I drunk a lot of water to relieve the dry mouth symptoms. Cravings were minimal. Today I took the pill about the same time as I did yesterday and had the same results along with diarrhea. I had a panic attack thinking about the side effects and thought about going to the hospital but luckily my mom calmed me down some so I&#039;m now writing this.""",3
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I am new to the anxiety realm, and have already tried a few different meds (xanax, ativan, buspar) and so far buspar has shown the most promise. However, even on buspar I still experience sporadic chest pressure, sharp pains in the chest, brain buzz, and muscle twitches. Today the chest issues were so bad that I had to take a xanax.

I am typically against prescribed meds, and this is really the first time in my life taking them. The side effects and other dangers scare the crap out of me, but I need to figure out how to subdue my anxiety.

Does anyone have any suggestions?""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I had struggled with moderate acne for 4 years. I tried every lotion and potion possible on prescription and every medicated facial wash available for acne prone skin. Nothing worked. Finally after a year of waiting for an appointment my dermatologist prescribed 30mg of isotretinoin (roaccutane).  It has taken about 3 months to start to see an improvement and now almost 6 months in my skin is completely clear. It has really helped my self confidence. The good thing is my clear skin will be permanently clear and the dreaded acne will not return. Other than severely dry lips and quite a few nose bleeds (although not as many as I thought) my side effects have been minimal. Stick with it, it definitely works, you just have to be patient.""",4
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks. I take Remeron for depression and Buspirone 15mg twice daily. I was on Xanax for 6 months but my doctor switched me to this because i will just continually need to be bumped up on the Xanax and it&#039;s not that effective in the long run, which is true. .5mgs do nothing for me anymore when they are supposed to suppress a panic attack and I really need them. The Buspirone puts up this big dam to hold back the river of emotions I have. I feel like I have emotions of steel compared to crying all the time. Part of my anxiety is racing thoughts. This helps me FOCUS. I haven&#039;t been this productive in 10 years. However this does NOTHING for panic attacks.""",7
Atralin,Acne,"""I have never written a review about a product until now! I&#039;m a 34 year old female &amp; started getting chin acne in my late twenties- nothing helped, I tried everything from Proactiv to Tretonion to antibiotics! About 4 months ago my dermatologist put me on Atralin &amp; oh my what a difference in 4 months! I even go without makeup now! I never get a pimple now it&#039;s wonderful &amp; it makes my skin look Dewey &amp; hydrated not dried out &amp; flakey as with the Tretonion I tried. Highly recommend Atralin!""",4
Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on immediate release version of Seroquel 200mg and the side effects were horrible! Everlasting hungover and craving for foods like if it&#039;s a drug or I would be going withdraw aka blood sugar crashes. So my Dr switched to seroquel 200mg extended release and it was a GODSEND form of drug! Barely any of sedating effects and even lack of any hungover.... And the best part was that I forgot to eat breakfast by accident several times in a week.... If for immediate release I would be going crazy for missing breakfast. Imagine that!""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have been using Zolpidem for about 6 mos for chronic nerve pain and anxiety. I take it before bedtime instead of another painkiller to help me relax before bed. You must be going to sleep at least 15-20 minutes after you take it because it will only initiate sleep, not meant to keep you asleep. I get at least 7 straight hours sleep without noticing my pain gnawing at me all night. It helps a lot!""",0
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""At first I was hesitant because of the price w/o ins (over $100 a bottle) and some people can develop a serious rash. However, after some contemplation, and knowing that the lithium I was taking was not helping my bi-polar depression, and knowing Lamictal helps increase energy, I decided to take it anyway... I LOVE THIS STUFF. Its helped me so much, I&#039;ve gone off lithium and am taking it exclusively for BP2. I&#039;m on a low dose of 50 mg because I experienced some itching at first, which did go away after about a month. Now, I have NO side effects, and my depression is GONE without me feeling numb. In other words, I can still be sad without spinning into depression. I haven&#039;t gone manic either, but I rarely go that way, so it works for me!""",6
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I am a 39 (soon to be 40) year old male. I stepped one the scale at the doctors office and I was horrified to learn that I had let myself get to 284lbs (I&#039;m only 5&#039;10). I asked the doc for some help, and she recommended a few drugs that might be able to help, Saxenda being one of them. I have been on Saxenda for 6 weeks and I have lost 23lbs.  I also stopped drinking any kind of soda, or sugary drinks, and not fast food. I let myself have a cheat meal a week, but I can&#039;t even finish it when I do have it. 

I did have a few issues in the beginning, headache the first week, and some sporadic nausea. The side effects have subsided, and for me the few days of discomfort have been well worth the reward.""",2
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I have been on Lexapro 10 mg  for a year and a half for depression and anxiety, along with generic remeron 15mg as sleep aid. Last summer I switched to only generic remeron (mirtrazipine) and my mood started to go up and down.  The thing with lexapro is it takes away inhibition. That also includes being more impulsive. So be careful when upset. It also ramped up anxiety in the first couple of weeks  and drives you nuts. I am getting back slowly on lexapro for 2 weeks. I got a few anxiety crisis so I take half 10mg and will try to increase slowly. Despite this minus, this is the best thing so far. BTW, generic escitalopram sucks. Tried and doesn&#039;t do the trick for  me.""",7
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had acne since like the 7th grade and I didn&#039;t really bother to do anything about it because it wasn&#039;t bad but at the end of 8th grade it got worse so I went to a dermatologist and she prescribed Epiduo to me and I used it and had clear skin for almost the whole summer, but in August when school started my face started getting horribly dry and peeling and it hurt. So I went back to the derm. and she prescribed Differin (0.3%) gel and I&#039;ve been using it now for 4 months and it works great! I have to say it does get worse before it gets better. """,4
Focalin XR,ADHD,"""Our Facts:  Son was getting into trouble at school every day. He was a terror around the house. His diet was exceptional, eating vegetables, fish, fruit, rice, and no sugary drinks or high fructose corn syrup.  Lots of love and discipline at home. Got in trouble all the time at home and school because he&#039;s uncontrollable.
With Focalin he immediately improved and is doing great in school.  He is actually happier and feeling better now.  While his appetite is down while on the medicine (about 7 hours), he eats a huge breakfast and a huge dinner to compensate.  Even his tick has gone away.   We are very relieved. Only downside is that it only lasts about 7 hours.  So when he gets home, he starts amping up again.""",1
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""Took Ambien for years but noticed increased short term memory problems, so I switched to Belsomra. Not the same kind of sleep you experience with Ambien. Took about 10 days for me to get used to this one because of the difference. It more mimics how you used to feel when you naturally got sleepy, not a dopey kind of sleep. Also, if you don&#039;t sleep because you&#039;re an extremely anxious person, you will not find this one as effective. I don&#039;t sleep as sound on this one if I have a lot on my mind, worrisome things, versus I just can&#039;t sleep because I&#039;m wondering if, for example, Tesla&#039;s ideas really will work :)""",0
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have been on every antidepressant in the book except the MAO inhibitors for  the past 20 years.  In the past year every antidepressant in the class SSRI OR SNRI has given me diarrhea and I quit taking all of them.  I am now on trazodone 225 mg which is partially helpful for insomnia and depression.  I am also taking neurontin 300 mg. 3 times per day for pain which isn&#039;t helping but it does help my mood.  I also am taking an old drug vistaril 50-100 mg. per night.  No one pill will help me sleep. I take Lunesta 3 mg. which helps most of the time.  My insurance won&#039;t pay the full amount because it is expensive.  Heaven help me when I get on Medicare because it will force me to take generics and their isn&#039;t one of Lunesta yet.  I tapered off""",0
Methadone,Pain,"""Methadone has been the only pain medicine that I&#039;ve found that relieves my back and neck pain and allows me to work and function without being high or loopy. The only problem that I have found is finding a Doctor who is aware that methadone is used for more than treatment of heroin addiction. I would also think there would be a lower incidence of abuse because you don&#039;t get the &quot;high &quot; you get with other narcotics. """,9
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I just started taking Vyvanse today and have already seen an outstanding improvement! I am an 18 year old mother that struggled throughout high school, not because of intelligence, but lack of motivation to complete things such as homework or projects. I failed quite a few classes and ended up having to take a second senior year. Since my daughter was born and I now have a house to clean and all other kinds of &quot;mommy duties,&quot; I really found myself struggling. It was to the point of a failing relationship and disappointment to my family and my significant other. I was unable to just focus on a task and complete it. But today, I did everything I needed to do and then some and I feel great. Very pleased so far.""",1
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had the implant for about two months now and I have not really had any problems except for strange bleeding patterns which I was told was to be expected for the first six months to a year. The only other thing that kind of bothered me was a weird bout of serious depression and irritability, but I just reminded myself my body is getting used to this new method. I had been using the depo shot since I was about 15 ( I am 20 now) and it&#039;s fairly similar. One thing I like is that I have not had any weight gain, but I&#039;ve actually been able to lose weight fairly easy. I know it&#039;s early but I love it, and if I have any weird problems in the future I can just get it removed, which I like!""",8
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I found the medication very helpful with only some nausea lasting a few days but constipation that continued. It was very calming and helped my sleep. Then after about 2 months I began to get pain in all of my joints especially any joint that I may have injured in the past. I was unable to get through a work out at the gym and that is the best treatment for me. The day that I opened a tube of toothpaste and wrenched  the joint in my thumb was when I had to say enough. It has taken now over 3 months to regain my range of motion and to be mostly without pain caused by this medication. After reading the other review about joint pain I felt I should also comment about my experience.""",5
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I tried Lexapro because I was very high strung, was easily angered over the most minor incidents and was always worried about everything. Was hoping for any sign of relief. I didn&#039;t really notice any significant improvements in the first few weeks but I&#039;m on the fourth month of taking it now and what a difference. It&#039;s not like a light bulb went off and I completely changed. I still get angry and worry but it goes away easily. You just don&#039;t care as deeply as you used to. For me it&#039;s worth it. I wouldn&#039;t call it a miracle but it most definitely takes the edge off. I am thrilled with it.""",7
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Saphris for about a month now. I started at 5mg at night and now up to 10mg. Helps me fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. First few days I had rough mornings but none since. The taste is awful. I use the black cherry but maybe I will try the sweet tart trick I have learned about. I also take 60mg Celexa and 0.5mg of Klonopin (twice a day for this one) every day. I am bipolar and have depression and since being on Saphris everyone has noticed a big change in my moods. Racing thoughts are a hell of a lot better too! Side effects: constipation, very gassy, bloated stomach, loss of taste, and sore and numb tongue. Hopefully my body will adjust but if not I think the pros out way the cons.""",6
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""Been on this for a few years now, taking 225mg/day. The side effects are unpleasant, but have abated greatly thankfully. When I started there was the WORST DRY MOUTH EVER. Persistent and I couldn&#039;t go five minutes without drinking something.
Had sleep problems with it, including ridiculous night sweats where I&#039;d wake up with a body imprint in my sheets (gross, yes) almost every night. Couldn&#039;t sleep more than 2-4 hours at a time. But trust me when I say these things were nothing compared to what I was feeling before (we&#039;re talking 0.5 on a scale of 1-10) and while I&#039;m not 100% it is certainly the single thing keeping me from killing myself, which is nice.
I can now sleep about 6 hours at a time and only have night sweats if I DON&#039;T take it.""",5
MS Contin,Pain,"""I have suffered for many years with AS and Degenerative Disc disease. With all the NSAIDs, Methotrexate, and pain killers I developed ulcers in my esophagus, stomach and duodenum. Thankfully my Doctor decided to switch me to Morphine because it is easier on the system. Now I take 60 mg MS Contin twice a day and 4 to 6mg Dilaudid as needed for breakthrough pain. The plus is that the ulcers have all healed and although the pain is not totally gone it is very manageable. The minus is that I have had to gradually increase my dosage over the years because your body learns to tolerate it. Adjusting to a new dose can take a little while and it causes constipation (Benifiber works great).""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Diagnosed with ADHD at 53. Who knew there was a reason for my quirky personality.  Tried Stattera and slept 15-18 hours a day, was switched to Ritalin and thought this was it. I really like how I feel, calm, focused.  My friends noticed. I did great for a couple of weeks and then became extremely impulsive and inappropriate.  I was focused, but on warp speed.  I gained 10 lbs in a week, because I could not stop eating once I started, I went on shopping sprees, driving jags, blurted out without the think before you speak button.  Once I started a task I had to finish, my kids were late to school, you get the picture.  This was definitely not the drug for me.  I stopped taking it a couple of days ago, I am still feeling the effect.""",1
Paxil,Anxiety,"""After 10 years on citalopram working brilliantly, it &#039;pooped&#039; out on me. I was put on sertraline which made me 100 times worse and I felt like I was losing my mind. There were times when I was suicidal which never happened before. After 18 months of trying different medications I decided to try Paxil. I was nervous to be honest but I wanted to feel better than what I was. I have anxiety, depression which led to my OCD, mainly intrusive thoughts which were very distressing. I must say that after 2 weeks I have felt better than what I had done in ages. Still not 100% but it is early days. I know everyone reacts differently to medications but do not be put off by negative reviews, this might be the drug for you. I am so glad that I tried it.""",7
Cymbalta,Depression,"""6 months of problems with Cymbalta/Duloxetine &amp; so sick and tired that I&#039;ve thrown them in the bin and with no help and advice from my GP. even though I know that &#039;cold turkey&#039; from snri&#039;s could damage my health. From the outset of taking this drug I had chronic diarrhoea. This lasted 4+ months and have now been diagnosed with microscopic colitis despite no previous gastric problems in my life. I&#039;ve gained the best part of a stone in weight, I was drowsy and sleeping during the daytime. The drug did not vastly reduce my anxiety or depressed moods and did not help with any pain that is caused by my osteoarthritis of spine &amp; knees. Withdrawal symptoms seem to be minimal,10 days of cessation, so fat experienced a little tearful and irritable.""",5
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I have low back pain and down my right leg from osteoporosis, arthritis and degenerative disc disease. For two years I have cried most of the night in severe pain. This medicine takes about 45 minutes to kick in and lasts about 3 hours at 5mg. The problem (I think) is that my doctor will not raise the dose, which I understand but only allows me to take it every 12 hours. After about 3-4 hours I&#039;m in severe pain again and just watch the clock and cry. The label on the bottle says every 4 hrs as needed but will not refill if I take more than 2 a day. """,9
Bactrim,Acne,"""I have used solydyne in the past, two different dosages. They worked at first then stopped working. Again they the increased dosage, even that stopped working. Then i was put on bactrim. The nice thing about bactrim for me was that it worked every time you use. I was give a strong prescription 100mg twice daily. And then 50mg twice daily for an year.

The nice thing about bactrim is you see it working. The acne where it used to be becomes dried out and you feel that the meds are working. With others i have seen it disappear and then appear again. With bactrim it was just really clean. I have recently started doxycyline and it has not worked so far. Not a bit. It does seemed working the first week but not any more.""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I can&#039;t tell you how great this has been for me. Slight disruption in my period but nothing serious.  Since that though I haven&#039;t had my period in 8 months. June was the last time.  March now.  No mood swings. SO MUCH BETTER than traditional birth control.  Used to be on tri sprintec and cried all the time for no reason.   I love nexplanon.  Will take it out when having a kid next year sometime, but going back in right after.  Oh, not painful either.  Kinda uncomfortable cause you need to keep it under wraps for a day or two after getting it, but honestly so worth it.   Sounds like I was paid to say this lol.  Really, I know everyone is different, but for me this was a god send.  Hope your experience is as good as mine.""",8
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""Been taking 100mg for around 6 months now for Depression and Anxiety. I felt an almost immediate effect from Pristiq, did have trouble getting to sleep for the first 10 or so days and felt weird and spaced out a bit but nothing bad. I now feel great, I have a clear head and great concentration. I&#039;m a lot more social too. I&#039;m much more relaxed and look at life in a positive way. Stick with it, its the best medicine I have used by far.""",5
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking Geodon back in May or June of 2013. It worked well enough but made me indifferent. Yes, it did help me get out of an incredibly long and terrible state of depression, but I lost the ability to feel anything at all. My legs would become restless (most often at night) and I was always exhausted. I would even doze off or completely fall asleep at work.  I stayed on it for a few months then stopped taking it when I started a hypomanic phase.""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19, and I&#039;m now 23. I have a &quot;severe&quot; case as my psychologist &amp; therapist would say in the 1 visit I met with them. I started out on Adderall and Adderall XR, but had to stop taking it due to the side effects like mood swings and Parkinson&#039;s like shaking in my hands. So my dr changed my meds to Vyvanse. I&#039;ve been taking it for 1 yr and I no longer have mood swings or shake which is awesome because I don&#039;t think someone would like a shaking dental hygienist. I like Vyvanse because it still helps me concentrate, stay organized, and remember things that are told to me, but it wears off quickly. That is my only dislike about Vyvanse.""",1
Trazodone,Anxiety,"""I have been prescribed trazodone for generalized anxiety disorder with insomnia. I started with 50 mg only at bedtime about for a week and now at 100 mg in a single dose at bedtime. It helped me a lot with the anxiety (it calmed me down) and also it improved considerably my sleep at night. Although the sedating activity is immediate, the anxyolytic activity takes some time to show effect and requires increasing dose. I have noticed no major side effects, except from orthostatic hypotension and some headaches mainly at the beginning of the treatment. It works well as a sleep aid, but care must be taken when you increase the dose (should be done gradually increasing the dose by 25 mg). The dose of 100 mg at bedtime works fine for me. I will continue on this dose and see how things go on.""",7
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""Dexedrine is a SUPERB medication for controlling ADHD Impulsivity. It&#039;s a 100% smooth and clean ride compared to Adderall. Unfortunately for me though I lack motivation so Adderall is a better choice for me. I did rate this out of Symptom control. If Dexedrine motivated like Adderall does it would literally be the perfect medication.

Pros:
Superior Focus
Reduced Impulsive decisions the best.
Side effects are minimal compared to Adderall

Cons:
Lacks motivational Kick that Adderall delivers.
Only comes in 5MG, 10MG, &amp; 15MG Capsules and is expensive.

Belviq,Obesity,"""So all of my life I have been some what chubby, but at  least couple of years I let my weight go out of control. I went to the doctors on May 26th and she weighed me at 261! :( That day she prescribed me belviq. I took my first pill that night. I weighed myself on June 2nd and I am down to 256.4! I don&#039;t know how much of that was water weight but it was definitely encouraging to see that on the scale! I will post again in a week :)""",2
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""It has been approximately 3 months and I am down 12 lbs. The side effects are minor and well worth the loss of weight. Although the weight loss has been slow, I never felt deprived of food ONCE. I plan to stay on it for a year as I have another 40 lbs to go. This pill definitely decreases my appetite. I have experienced a few headaches and yes, the coughing, but compared to having a heart attack from being overweight, I am fine with that. If you are overweight, I think you should give this medication a try for at least a month or two. Also, never felt jittery at all on this. The biggest downside is the cost. I think that is part of the plan - it costs so much that you can&#039;t afford food after paying for it. They offer a $75 off coupon.""",3
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I just started contrave on the 3rd of October, so I am on my second day. I&#039;m amazed at how quick my cravings were shut down and what I couldn&#039;t resist before, now doesn&#039;t even get a second look. My only negative response to this medication are the headaches I&#039;m getting on it. I&#039;m hoping that after my body adjusts, those will fade. I&#039;ll check in later and give another update as I continue this prescription.""",3
Sonata,Insomnia,"""After years of not being able to fall asleep or stay asleep and after trying Lunesta and Ambien I was tired. Sonata works great for me and I don&#039;t wake up groggy or hung over. I feel great for the first time in my life. I have fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome and it is essential to get sleep. I feel refreshed and ready to go in the mornings.....love it. Thankful my doctor said to give it a try. Hope this helps.""",0
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been using this for three months and I&#039;m finally taking this emotional draining mister out this next cycle. I was so excited to use this at first but as each month went by I felt more and more depressed and miserable. My labito went down incredibly low to the point where the thought of even having sex would just give me headaches. I was never like this and I&#039;ve become an emotional beast using this and it has effected the relationship I&#039;m currently in. I don&#039;t recommend this, although it has amazing perks and it&#039;s convenient it&#039;s not worth destroying you as a person and possibly you&#039;re relationship and own overall happiness.""",8
Xanax,Anxiety,"""Very helpful in reducing anxiety for me.  It is fast-acting, and it made a difference in me being able to keep up with my job.  Now, I&#039;m on Klonopin though since the doctor said that it stays in the system longer for anxiety.  However, the fast relief of Xanax works very well when an immediate spike in anxiety happens.  The effects usually only last a few hours for me, and I can understand how it can be addictive for this reason, but it&#039;s been great for immediate panic symptoms and helpful with focusing.  I did not notice that &quot;drugged up,&quot; foggy feeling on a small dose of .5 mg-1 mg as needed.""",7
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Retin-A truly did a 360 on my skin. I have mild to moderate breakouts with terrible hormonal flare ups. Hence when I first tried Retin-A over a year ago, it only worked for a short while and then I discovered I was expecting and had to stop using it. Glowing during pregnancy led to return of the bumps around my chin and forehead postpartum. Now I&#039;m back on 0.025% and am in love with my skin again. Smooth, healthy, and rosy looking even when that time comes. It started working immediately. I skip every third night to keep from over drying and desensitizing. Goodluck all.""",4
Celexa,Depression,"""I have absolutely no complaints about Celexa. I&#039;ve been on 20mg for about a month and a half now, and I feel like a huge weight has just been lifted off of me. I spend so much less of my day thinking about things that upset me, and I&#039;m much more capable of just letting negative thoughts go and not letting them affect me. As a college student, I&#039;ve dealt been dealing with a tremendous amount of social and academic stress. I was very weary about getting on an antidepressant out of fear of being &quot;judged&quot;, but in retrospect getting on Celexa may be the best decision I&#039;ve ever made. I couldn&#039;t help but to post on here and share my experience. It certainly took a little while to kick in, but be patient. I am feeling happy like I haven&#039;t in years!""",5
Abilify,Depression,"""Was on Prozac for the last 4 years to treat my depression, anxiety and intrusive thoughts until my Prozac pooped out. I upped my Prozac with no relief. I tried other ssris  Zoloft,Celexa Lexapro which only made my condition worse. I even tried an snri Cymbalta with no relief.  7 months later  I finally got to see a psychiatrist. He put me back on Prozac 10 mg and augment with Abilify. It took a month before I decided to try it because of the cost ($110.00 for 30 2mg pills) I felt it working 2 days later. After 1 week my intrusive thoughts went away and my depression lifted with anxiety gone. I had zero side effects. Its been 10 days now and I feel myself again, going out and doing things. For me Abilify is a perfect fit, I hope it lasts.""",5
Xenical,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve currently been on this medication for only 2 weeks and I have already lost a stone with no side effects due to sticking to a low fat diet but this hasn&#039;t stopped me from eating my naughty treats I just now make a homemade healthier version, which if I&#039;m honest I enjoy more there are a lot of healthy options of food out there to trick your mind into thinking something naughty I recently purchased some chicken sausages and they are lovely. Looking forward to continuing my journey on this medication""",2
Citalopram,Depression,"""I love Celexa and am grateful that it works for me. After my 1st panic attack in May 07, my doctor put me on zoloft. At first I liked it because it really helped with the anxiety immediately. I then noticed it made me feel like a zombie, the lows weren&#039;t as low, but there were not any highs anymore either. I had a few bouts of &quot;rage&quot; as well. After getting pretty depressed this winter 07-08, I went back to the doctor and it was actually the nurse practitioner who changed my medicines to Celexa. I was on 20 mg for 2 weeks and then she increased it to 40 mg. I have been on the 40 mg of Celexa now for 2 months and have never felt better. I am calm and happy but still feel like my funny self.""",5
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on nuvaring for almost 3 years and it has been the most convenient, with the least side effects. I&#039;ve have lighter periods especially in the last yr or so. I know others say it helps with cramps as well, but my pain hasn&#039;t decreased as far as I can remember. 

My husband says he feels it when we have sex, and when we get really energetic it tends to bruise him. I do find that the week before my period I get nauseous on and off during the day but that&#039;s may have nothing to do with the nuvaring at all.

Outside of that it&#039;s been a real awesome experience for me. No serious side effects.""",8
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I was so glad to see positive feedback on the Mirena. I have only had it in for 2 weeks but really am fine with it. I do notice I have been a tad dizzy and sleeping a little less, i.e. waking up at 4am, but that could be stress of life as well. Thank you all for posting something positive to read about this. I was really starting to worry I was going to have bad stuff start to happen. Insertion was  fine, slight cramping for a couple of hours then slight cramping off and on for the next couple of days but nothing major at all. Thanks again.""",8
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I am 36 yr old 5&#039;4 226 lb. Type 1 insulin pump dependent diabetic.  I was lost.  Nothing worked. I started Qsymia on 02/18/2013, the day after my birthday.  I needed help.  I had no will power.  So, after doing my research, deciding I had to make a change for me. I started Qysmia, a low carb diet, and joined a gym.  I am happy to report I have lost 22 pounds. I have many more to go, but I have also lowered my insulin in half, and am working to delete my other dependency on blood pressure and cholesterol medications.  Thanks Qysmia, you helped me get my life back. """,2
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I had such a difficult time getting this approved through my insurance, however, finally I did for $80.00.  What a huge disappointment!!  I have suffered with chronic pain, degenerative arthritis, and insomnia for years.  I was hopeful after watching the commercial, that finally I would find an effective medication.  To my surprise, all it did was help keep me up all night, some ringing in the ears, and absolutely no rest!!  Anyone who says this medication is helpful, must be experiencing the placebo effect.""",0
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal has been the most all round effective medication I have take and that is saying a lot for a patient of 40 years. What I mean by that is my system rejected all antidepressants and antipsychotics because of a side effect called Akathesia. I sustained on lithium and Klonopin alone for a long time.
Back then doctors were scared to death of Lamictal because of the rash that few to none got when properly prescribed. I couldn&#039;t find one to prescribe so I got it from my family doctor. That was the best day of my life. I titrated the lithium while slowly adding the Lamictal with no problems. I have been taking 450mg a day ever since. I also noticed how badly 30 years of lithium had hurt me. I no longer knew myself.""",6
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I talked to my doctor about Belviq and got a prescription last week. So far I have lost 4 pounds and feel great. It&#039;s like I am suddenly motivated to lose weight. I think as the weight comes off exercising will become easier. I am tolerating the medication without side effects. I noticed no appetite for food and a boost in energy without the nervousness I felt with some of the over the counter products I used to take. I have told my friends and family about Belviq.""",3
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got my IUD inserted Jan 4 2016, I am 25 and have no children. The implantation was painful but lasted less than 1 min. I did not experience cramping but I do have spotting. I am currently on my 1st period since getting skyla implanted. I&#039;m used to the pretty much non existent periods from my oral contraception. I&#039;m 6 days into my period :( .  Not having to take a pill everyday at the same time and filling a prescription is a plus but I&#039;m so over irregular bleeding. I will give this thing a full 6 months before I consider removing it.""",8
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""I am an adult, 54 years old, who was diagnosed with Adult ADD two years ago.  Adderall XR has made a huge difference in my quality of life.  I now have the ability to organize my day and focus on what I need to get done.  I fell very calm and can filter out all unecessary distractions.  I don&#039;t procrastinate like I use to whic has eliminated the unecessary anxioty in my life.  I work closely with my doctor to make sure that I am on the right dosage. i wish I had known about this 45 years ago!""",1
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I have suffered from severe anxiety for about 3 years now. I&#039;ve tried buspar for a little bit and it helped some but I didn&#039;t keep taking it. I just had to post what has taken 90% of my anxiety away and that&#039;s cardio exercise daily. I started going to the gym and riding the bike with the heart beat monitor on it.  I got my heart beat to 120 beats per minute and held it there til I got tired, then slowed down to rest a couple minutes then speed up again.. I&#039;m a crane operator and mostly sit all day in my crane. The very first day I sustained a higher heart rate by exercising for 15 minutes my anxiety levels plummeted. Every day after that it has gotten better. Before taking drugs for anxiety try fast walking for 15 minutes. It will help!""",7
Skyla,Birth Control,"""So I&#039;ll be 28 in 2 months....I am getting Skyla tomorrow, but, I&#039;ve had Mirena, after my 2 nd daughter I decided to get Mirena and it was the WORST thing in the WORLD....I was a major bitch I gained 20 lbs I was an emotional asshole and I bled NON stop...I can not be on birth control because I have a blood mutation so any pill makes me higher risk for blood clots...I just had my 3rd child almost 2 years ago and I had been getting SEVERE migraines and mood swings so I went to the doctor and asked her opinion, she said that Skyla is a lower dose and it may be better for me because she thinks the Mirena was too high of a hormone dose. BUT since I got Mirena in 2009, you&#039;d think I&#039;d forget the insertion I didn&#039;t..It wasn&#039;t that bad and I&#039;m a baby.""",8
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Prior to this medication it took me a month to lose 5lbs with strict dieting and vigorous exercise. I&#039;ve been on this med exactly 2 weeks and have lost 6.8lbs. Female, 5&#039;3&quot; and went from 204.5lbs to 197.7lbs. Keep in mind this is with absolutely no exercise (primarily because it&#039;s made me feel so nauseous) and no fancy diet plan and with a couple days dining out. I eat a fraction of what I used to eat and often have to remind myself to eat at all. This stuff is phenomenal and now I feel like it&#039;s actually possible for me to lose weight. Nausea has been the primary side effect, it&#039;s been rough at some points but manageable. I plan to start working out again next week so I&#039;ll definitely post an update after another month or so""",3
Sertraline,Depression,"""Side effects, both of which will go away eventually:  dry mouth, nervousness and jitteriness.

The other &quot;side effects&quot; that many mention are actually more in line with symptoms of depression and anxiety. It&#039;s very hard to come off of Zoloft as you WILL get the &quot;electrical shock&quot; effect (if you&#039;ve ever weaned yourself off, you know what I mean). Also, coming off any anti-depressant may cause/allow some rebound anxiety and depression.""",5
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been taking Doxy for a while until my face cleared up and I just had a lot of scarring on my face. Later on (mid-December) I starting to break out again and I had leftover Doxy. It doesn&#039;t seem to be as effective as before but it definitely works. You have to be patient and take when needed. I take 2x daily. You really want to eat a meal with this medication, not eating a meal could will you make you feel nauseous and could make you throw up.""",4
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I used to be on trazadone, Ambien, and Ambien CR. I enjoyed both Ambiens because I did get a lot of the sleep that I have missed out, but I did feel groggy when I woke up and still tired. When Ambien CR started to not work as well, I would ride a bike and end up in someone else&#039;s lawn. My body got so used to all of them that they now after 1 year of not taking them, still treats my body as if I am &quot;high&quot;. Everyone&#039;s experience is different.""",0
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""About 3-4 months of using this medicine I started to notice the way it effected my thinking. Things would come up in my life that would&#039;ve normally triggered my depression. However when these things happened, I felt a fake sense of relief. I felt like I wanted to be upset about these things that were happening, but my brain wouldn&#039;t let me. It felt unfamiliar and unlike myself. It was as though I could feel a whole layer of feelings that I was unable to express. My doctor switched me over to Zoloft and I&#039;m noticing better results.""",5
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""When I first starting taking abilify, I was about 14 and a half and 130 pounds, and it worked great. My mood was great, side effects were minimal. However, over the course of about a year I have gained almost 60 pounds, and that was while playing two varsity sports and a club sport that whole time, so I was active majority of that time. When I came off it recently, I lost about 10 pounds over two weeks, but I was much worse than I was before I went on it, (which I find weird), so I was put back on. It is impossible to get the weight to go away.""",6
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""Worst psychiatric drug I&#039;ve ever taken. I&#039;ve had bad side effects from regular SSRI&#039;s, so I was put on Mirtazapine 30mg. It knocked me out and turned me into a depressed zombie. I had SEVERE sedation, confusion, and dizziness which lasted all of next day. This continued for 4 days. It also made me extremely suicidal and I had to get an emergency Ketamine infusion which instantly lifted my depression and suicidal thoughts. Never taking this again.""",5
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been taking Lamictal as a mood stabilizer and a foundation to treat my depression. Found it was insufficient on its own so doctor started me on 40mg of Latuda. It worked very well but I just felt &quot;ok&quot; and it was quite expensive. Tried to switch to Abilify but the restlessness was intolerable and the therapeutic effect wasn&#039;t nearly as palpable. Switched back to Latuda at 60mg and don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever look back. Tried Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Pristiq, Effexor, and Cymbalta also.""",6
Oxydose,Pain,"""If your Doctor recommends this drug for pain please explore all other options before beginning to take it. I in the beginning thought that it was a God send and it did indeed work wonders on my chronic pain however after two hip revisions back to back , a spinal stimulator being placed then removed due to malfunction I find for me this medication for me takes the edge off at best. But I do not mean to ramble I am only one out of many millions that that this drug works wonders for. The other problem I had with this medication is when they changed the formulation. You see in changing it they made it harder for drug abusers to abuse and, for people like me who do not abuse it and really need it ,made less effective. HARD TO DOSE DOWN!!!!!""",9
Methylphenidate,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on celexa and a fentynal patch for a few years during and after battling cancer. but the fatigue from pain meds and anti-depressants left me feeling so tired through out the work day. I was to the point of almost falling asleep at the wheel driving home from work.  Weekends consisted of laying around doing nothing, losing all interest in even going for a haircut on Saturday. I asked my oncologist about ritalin and he put me on 20mg 3 times a day.  I had no idea how well it cured my depression as well as kept me going through out the day without feeling tired at all!  I never thought the Celexa worked for my depression and wonder if i should talk to my doctor now about weaning myself off the celexa and just go with the ritalin.""",5
Pristiq,Depression,"""I don&#039;t know how I have lived for 34 years without this medication. Pristiq has for me been a God send. I am now 5 weeks in, and have never felt this clear and focused. It&#039;s not a miracle worker, the situations I face daily still get me cranky and stressed, but I don&#039;t seethe anymore. I used to get angry with my kids for being &quot;naughty&quot;, and stay angry for ages, just getting worse and worse. Now I take the time to be a &quot;Mum&quot;, talking to them and not stressing about the little things they do. As for side effects, I had a little nausea, and irritability (which I still have at times, but I have 4 kids under 4, and my husband works away from home) but overall it&#039;s much more pleasant in our house. Good luck to everyone.""",5
Actiq,Pain,"""I have been on Actiq for over 2 years. I&#039;ve been on the same dose the whole time and I must admit, without it, I would be bed ridden and contorted.
Actiq is a very serious medication that each prescriber/user needs to be educated, responsible and accountable for. 
I truly thank the good Lord for it because my quality of life has improved tremendously, without it my life would be full of pain and agony and I would be just a shell of who I am now. So, Actiq is great, just use with care!""",9
Trintellix,Depression,"""I have tried over 20 different medications, and Trintellix is the best fit for me. I always describe its effect for me as &quot;being able to turn everything down in my head.&quot; I can see how this might not be a good fit for others as it might certainly aggravate &quot;feeling nothing&quot; or &quot;feeling detached.&quot; However, as my issue is primarily that I feel TOO much and am unable to step back from my emotions and intrusive, racing thoughts, Trintellix&#039;s &quot;detachment&quot; is extremely helpful for me. 

I do get nausea for the first week upon taking Trinellix or upping my dosage; however, this subsides for me. I was on 10mg for 8 months and have now increased my dosage to 20mg in hopes of it being even more effective.""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am 5&#039;4&#039; female. My starting weight was 217 lbs.  I have been using  contrave for 3 weeks now.  My current weight is 200.  I was experiencing really bad headaches for the first week and went away.  I did notice my mood is a lot better. I&#039;m more relaxed.  I sleep all night.  Before I had insomnia.  I  had the hardest time going to sleep, so that would lead my having a drink at night or take some sort of sleep aid.  I would also wake 2-3 times a night and stay up at least an hour each time.  Now I sleep all night and have not had to drink or take any sleep aids. The only complaint I have is the constipation.""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on this for about 3 months and thus far have lost about 20 lbs. Slow and steady, just the way it ought to be. Side effects are minimal. A little nausea but not intolerable. I have another 40 or so pounds to lose. It&#039;s great to finally have something that really works.
Downside? Does anyone&#039;s insurance actually cover this stuff? Cash pay it&#039;s $1000 a month. I have put that out for the last 3 months, between having crummy insurance for the first 2 months and then the deductible on my new insurance. NOW I am finding out that it is &quot;an excluded drug.&quot; Great! I guess they&#039;d rather treat me for diabetes, hypertension and the coronary I&#039;ll probably have from being fat. Does anyone else&#039;s insurance jerk them around about paying for this?""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""Wanted to give an update on the review I wrote 10 months ago. If you are an adult female with acne involving the jawline, hairline, neck, back, chest or upper arms, there is a great chance it could be hormonal. I had mild to moderate acne that suddenly worsened at the same time I started having irregular periods. It literally went from controllable to a disaster. I started researching and asked my doctor about trying spironolactone. This was almost exactly one year ago. First month consisted of a nasty initial breakout, but following that, I saw gradual improvement and am 100% clear for the first time in my adult life. My life is completely different. I used to hide. I can wear any clothing I want now. I will NEVER give up this medication.""",4
Reclipsen,Birth Control,"""I first started with Reclipsen a year ago for 2-3 months and experienced extreme mood swings. Very emotional and sensitive to everything/anything. I&#039;m not an emotional person. I also did get frequent headaches. I decided to switch to a generic (similar to Reclipsen) which alleviated all side effects. I started taking Reclipsen again this month after my annual check up (my doctor refilled for name brand) I&#039;m on week 2 and I&#039;m having the same side effects. I had a major melt down which made me question what is really going on? I realized it must be the birth control. I&#039;m going back to generic asap. I had no weight gain, cramping nor acne issues while taking Reclipsen only mood swings and headaches.""",8
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was taking Geodon with Cymbalta and Clonazepam.  I was hospitalized 4 times in a year! Never has that happened  (I go inpatient maybe every 3-5 year&#039;s for a med adjustment). They kept increasing Cymbalta and Geodon.  I believe my last increase had me at 100mg of Geodon.  Not only did it MAKE me act bi-polar,  I also had full body tremors 24/7, heart palpitations and tachycardia  (mainly at bedtime). The last episode lasted 3 hour&#039;s.  I iced my body (to lower core temperature), took very deep breaths and massaged the main artery, left side of the neck. I was about to call 911 when it finally stopped. I seriously thought I was dying! I wouldn&#039;t recommend Geodon for anyone who doesn&#039;t require a mood stabilizer based on diagnosis.""",6
Minocycline,Acne,"""Due to a huge amount of stress that has taken over my life; I have been getting extreme acne lately. I&#039;ve tried everything I possibly can to rid these nasty Zits. My boyfriend luckily is completely non-judgemental, or I&#039;d be single if I was with an idiot. My doctor just prescribed this huge bottle of orange pills. Monocycline 100mgs 3 times daily. I&#039;m hoping there are no side effects. I will update how my recovery goes in the near future. :) let&#039;s hope for the best because I need clear skin... I&#039;d die for it. I swear it&#039;s something in the water that causes me to break out. I do everything normally and shower almost three times per day. There&#039;s no reason I should have acne because I&#039;m completely hygenic. Oh well... Let&#039;s give this a go! %u2764%uFE0F""",4
Gabapentin,Pain,"""Okay, I want to start off by clarifying that this med won&#039;t work for everyone. But when it does work, it is amazing. This drug has been a godsend. 

I have Lupus which has caused me to have horrible pains to where I can&#039;t sleep.
I now can sleep through the night because of this med. I was on 400 mg of methadone and I still had pain. So, the doctor added gabapentin and started to taper the methadone. I am now only on gabapentin and it is wonderful.

With that being, when you first start taking it, you will feel drink and clumsy. However, those side effects go a way.

This medication works best the longer you take it. Good Luck!""",9
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I have nothing but good things to say about this product. I first started getting small pimples around my nose when I was 13 which then gradually turned in to more persistent moderate acne. I am currently 18 and have been on so many different topical products such as Differin, Dalacin T, Clindets and other topicals, which did nothing for my skin. My dermatologist was so hesitant to prescribe me oral antibiotics (which is understandable because of antibiotic resistance) and prescribed me birth control instead (Alesse 28). This caused my acne to worsen and I was not happy at all. Anyhow, I&#039;m off that now and on Doxy and tretinoin cream. I have had no side effects so far. Happy.""",4
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I started Belviq after first losing a significant amount on Weight Watchers, so progress was sort of slow for me. I lost about a half a pound a week for the three months I was on it, but my motivation level was low. The problem for me came when I tried to stop taking it.  I had the symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome pretty bad. These included lightheadedness, dizziness, tingly hands and feet, and blurry vision. This all scared me very much - I thought I was going to have a stroke. I even had what felt like an electric shock shoot through different parts of my body a few times.  I was really relieved to find out that this is a fairly common condition and only lasts 2-3 weeks, but it was pretty uncomfortable.""",3
Lidoderm,Pain,"""My doctor gave me a couple of these to try out before I filled a script for them (for shoulder and lower back pain). I cut them up because they are HUGE. Put &frac12; on my back and &frac12; on my shoulder the first night. I hadn&#039;t slept more than a couple of hours a night for the last week because of my back (that&#039;s with oxymorphone and oxycodone) and WOW, slept like a baby! Took my back pain from an 8 to a 3. I didn&#039;t even notice the patch was there. 

Now for my shoulder though, these things aren&#039;t very sticky and so the movement makes them come off in just a couple minutes. I taped it down, but it&#039;s kinda bubbling in the middle and I&#039;m having a hard time keeping it in contact with my skin unless I&#039;m holding my arm just so.""",9
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been taking 10mg Endep for 2 weeks for bladder pain. I may have a mild case of interstitial cystitis but I haven&#039;t been officially diagnosed yet. I have found it has worked really well with the pain. I went from being in pain all the time to only a couple of times and it&#039;s been manageable. I have dry mouth and an increased appetite from Endep but the worst side effect is constant drowsiness and a general feeling of being drugged up.""",9
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have had SI on and off since I could remember. This changed my life. I&#039;ve only had a suicidal thought once or twice in the last 8 months of treatment. I&#039;ve had a lot of stressful situations pop up during this time and I am thrilled with how well I was able to manage. Only on 100mg once daily was with 60mg duloxetine and 150 bupropion. I wish I didn&#039;t waste all these years struggling. Why wasn&#039;t this in my life 15 years ago?""",6
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I had a work accident over a year ago. I have taken every pain medicine, had the spinal shots therapy. Now I&#039;m taking this and have virtually no pain. However, if/when you are taking this, be careful - about 2-4 hours after taking it, you will feel extremely drunk or high for a while. Don&#039;t drive on this stuff. But overall, it has worked better than all the other medicines I have been on.""",9
Doxycycline,Acne,"""Eh.. will not say I hate this drug but honestly I did not love it. I started taking it in the winter last year  and took it all the way up until about May, my results were nothing what I expected. Some days I thought it was working but really I don&#039;t think it ever did much. Anyways in the summer I stopped taking the medication and the sun did all of the work. But now I am not outside getting sun so my acne is getting awful. I was prescribed  to take spironolactone a medication know to help people with high potassium. I waited about a month before I took the prescription, I finally convinced myself to take it after reading the rates and results. I am excited to use it and hope for the best results. Also this medication is used to treat hormonal acne""",4
Vilazodone,Depression,"""Have completed 1 month on viibryd, but no change in mood. This weekend I will go from 20mg to 40. I was on highest doses of Lexapro, then Effexor, so might need 40 b/f seeing change. I&#039;ve come this far, so I&#039;ll stick it out and see what happens. Have had vivid, detailed dreams every night, but no nightmares. Did forget to take med 1 morning and had terrible day at work--extreme irritability, even anger. Took med when got home, and next day back to normal. Also experienced increased depression &amp; sadness when took med too late 1 Saturday. Whole time on med, have eaten less, but only feel like eating salty, sweet, and/or high fat foods. No interest in salad or veggies, which I normally eat. Hopefully that will change.""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""We are disappointed.  My 14 year old son has taken 40 mg 1x/day for 18 days and his skin is worse than ever.  He seems more moody than normal and his lips are super chapped (I feel like the chapped-lip police with my chapstick in hand).  We really hoped for results of any kind with his cystic acne.  We are going to try a higher dose after he gets the blood test in a week or so. He is discouraged. The cost of the higher dosage is almost prohibitive.  Our insurance doesn&#039;t cover meds because we have a high deductible but we feel that clearing up his acne is important for his self esteem.  It seems criminal to charge so much for meds.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""53 year old female, 5&#039;6, 202 lbs. Lost 30+ lbs in 9 months by eating all &quot;fresh&quot; food (nothing from a package) and walked 10 mins 2x a day (bought a cheap bracelet pedometer that kept me motivated.) Got down to 186. Back up to 202. Asked my Dr if I could try this. Want to get to 170. Started today at 5 am! :) Will keep you posted!  Thank you all so much for sharing your stories...it is very comforting to have so many in the same boat! :)""",3
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My 9 year old daughter has been on this for about 2 months.  We switched from Adderall XR due to severe weight loss.  This seems to work much better and also does not affect her personality like Adderall.   She has some loss of appetite but not as bad.   Yesterday I forgot to give the medication to her and she had a severe crying spell last night and did not know why.  I believe she may have been experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  She is taking 40 mg.   I may switch back to 30mg.  Be aware that you may not be able to stop this medication abruptly if on it for a long time.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""The drug is no doubt very effective in clearing acne . But you cannot avoid the 2nd time break outs which may come after 2-3 years and that will be the worst break out because accutane lowers your immunity and it cannot fight against the breakouts next time. Also accutane has got lots of side effects and it risks your life to lots of health issues and it can destroy your life forever. It is the worst drug ever to have. I urge to people who are reading this review to please not to consume this drug and please warn your friends, relatives, near and dear ones not to consume this drug. Your life is more important than anything else. If you want to survive and have a healthy life . """,4
Spironolactone,Acne,"""Update from 8/26/13
My 16 yr old has been on spironolactone for under 3 months. Bye- bye concealer and make up. Skin is now clear on face and having to wear make up is now an option verses a must. THANK GOD self esteem is back. She went off pill she had side effects. So far side effects from spironolactone are small. She is more tired than usual. Also has 2 periods a month.  Dr said it should stabilize in next few months.  Her skin is truly clear. Not just sort of but clear. Let it work and be patient.  Can take 4 to 6 months to work.""",4
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was prescribed 200-700mg for bipolar with psychotic features. At 200-400mg I slept well and woke up happy and felt content. Some symptoms remained, thus the increase to 700mg. At that level I had nightly blackouts where I would write belligerent texts to loved ones at night, and have no memory of it. I was horrified to learn of it later. I&#039;ve tried Geodon and Zyprexa with bad results like drooling somnolence and tachycardia. Next doctor visit I will ask to be put on 300 Seroquel. I had good results at that level, and wish to return to that. Looking forward to it. I&#039;m not on any anti-psychotic currently and I feel anxious.""",6
Metadate CD,ADHD,"""My 9yr old son has been on it Metadate 20mg for over a year now. Only side effect is lost of appetite so I make him eat a big breakfast. He only takes it on the week days for school it has really helped him to focus. My sons grade improved from 60&#039;s to 90&#039;s. I like Metadate because by the time he&#039;s out from school the medication has warn off and he&#039;s back to his normal active self. During the summer I also give him a break from the med and we do not have to tapper off in order for him to stop. We&#039;ve tried other medications that which had not so good side effects. Metadate so far is the best.""",1
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""Began having thyroid issues years ago which in turn caused a progressive weight gain.  I do not have heart problems, diabetes (showing some tendencies) or any severe diseases but have become very obese.  My endocrinologist suggested Belviq as a way to help me lose weight and regain some energy &amp; mobility and to prevent any development of full blown diabetes.  I began back in November and as of yesterday I have lost 19 pounds - this was through Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas.  The first two weeks I experienced some dizziness but it was mild.  I also have experienced &quot;very active&quot; dreams nightly but not enough to prevent rest.  The weight loss has been wonderful and my clothes are fitting more comfortably.  It has been an answer to prayer!""",2
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Lexapro saved my life. I have been on this medicine for about 7 weeks now.  At first, I was hesitant because I have tried them all--Effexor (constantly exhausted and edgy), Paxil (worked great for anxiety but had horrible sexual side effects and brain zap feelings), Zoloft (didn&#039;t help), Celexa (helped a little but Lexapro is definitely better for me).  Finally I found one I can rely on! The first week my anxiety got worse, which my doctor warned me of.  Luckily I had Xanax to get me through the first couple weeks. But now, I find myself not needing the Xanax at all anymore. I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since the 2nd week I started this medicine, and I am loving life! Thank you Lexapro.""",7
Amphetamine,ADHD,"""I enjoyed Evekeo.  It was great when it came to improving focus.  I also have shift work disorder so for me stimulants are great as they help me overcome the hump I hit every morning when I just want to go to bed and sleep all day.  My wife complained that I was getting really hard to live with compared to normal.  I knew I was more irritable than normal.  Over the 5 months I took it I did feel like the level of irritabilty and arguementativeness was steadily increasing.  Stopped taking when my wife told me I was starting to become unbearable.   I usually get 2 migraines a year but while on evekeo I had 3 in 5 months.""",1
Quillivant XR,ADHD,"""The dosing was 0.5mg x 2 doses, daily. 
The first few days (1-4) were great. We noticed more our 5 yr old soon looking at us for longer periods of time when speaking to him. Also, he seemed to turn his work (kindergarten) completed, the teacher was impressed with that. However, his ODD (more defiant) became worse at the end of the first week, he began hiding under his desk saying &quot;don&#039;t look at my face,&quot; and more emotional all around. At the end of the week, he had 2-3 full on accidents (urination on himself, in the daytime.) This was where I put my foot down and dropped this drug. My son did not have any problems with bladder control before this drug. I am not going to continue this with out reassurance from prescribing doctor.""",1
Copper,Birth Control,"""I had the iud inserted yesterday and I was not expecting the pain I was about to go through. She first had to look inside my uterus to see if it would fit since I haven&#039;t had any kids before and she did that by opening my uterus and feeling around. It was some of the worst pain I&#039;ve gone through and the doctor ensured me that what I was feeling was normal. After she inserted it I felt nauseous from the pain and felt cramping afterward. Worst cramping I&#039;ve ever felt. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;ll get better.""",8
Tretinoin,Acne,"""This stuff is amazing. Not only for acne and acne scars, but for its anti-aging benefits too. I experience moderate hormonal acne breakouts on my chin/jaw area. While Tretinoin doesn&#039;t exactly stop my breakouts completely, it helps control my skin when I do have a breakout. I feel any pimples clear up and heal much quicker and any spotty discolouration that occurs after spots heal disappears much quicker. This stuff has especially done wonders for fine lines around my eyes and between my brows. My skin tone is more even, pores are smaller and condition of my skin/complexion is far nicer. My skin peeled a lot during the first few weeks- use once every few nights until your skin adjusts. I use nightly now with no problems.""",4
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""I have severe chronic insomnia associated with FM/CFS. I have been unable to fall asleep or stay asleep for nearly 10 years. Tried many other medicines for sleep that didn&#039;t work or had unacceptable side effects. Sonata served me well for 5 years. Was taking 10 mg to get to sleep and then another 10mg to get back to sleep during the night. Our health insurer changed and they will only pay for 1 pill per night. My health and quality of life has deteriorated.""",0
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I have had mirena for 6 months, insertion was not painful just a slight pinch feeling, had a continuous period with severe cramps for 3 weeks after with worse cramps than ever before. I have had weight gain, spotting and bleeding for weeks at a time, headaches, severe lower back pain and cramps that feel like contractions for the last 4 months or so. The side effects have gotten better, still with bad cramps and weight gain, have not had a period in about 2 months. It is convenient and easy if your a forgetter like me, and if given enough time to adjust it is a good thing.""",8
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""Many doctors seem to be convinced that if you have an AD disorder, you simply can&#039;t get high on stimulant medications. This is NOT the case at all.

First off,  stimulant medications in general work well... very very well. 

The first day I took adderall I was at school. About an hour after I took my dose of 20mgs I started to feel this awake, alert, energetic feeling inside. I liked, a lot. For the next 5 hours all of my boring subjects became very interesting and I became a very social person. After about a month, those effects started to go away. I went to the doc and asked for a dose increase. Without any hesitation, he DOUBLED my dose to 40mg. I quickly found my self abusing adderall. 1 year later and I&#039;m now in rehab for drug abuse.""",1
Nuvigil,Bipolar Disorde,"""Nuvigil is a great medication. I have Bipolar disorder mixed state. I was often drowsy before taking Nuvigil. The first few days of taking 250mg of Nuvigil I felt better than ever. I was working out at the gym for an hour. Before taking the medication I couldn&#039;t even run. Depression sucked the life out of me. One of the bad side effects of Nuvigil is it induces mania/hypomania. I became hypomanic until my mood would drop down to depression and I had to take a mood stabilizer in order to normalize my mood.""",6
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got it on April 24 2008, the afternoon of the day I had my baby girl. I must say that IT was new to the birth control scene and my doctors had recommended it for me. I must say I really like it. I had it for 6 yrs now and I am about to get it replaced for a new one. They last for 3 yrs. I don&#039;t get a period every month I get it every 3 to 6 months and when I do sometimes its heavy but most of the time its light like enough for panty liners. """,8
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am a 17 year old female who was diagnosed with ADD about 9 months ago. I had mainly B and C grades, I was scatter-brained, easily distracted, and extremely messy. Since I started Vyvanse at 30mg, I have bumped up to 40mg and I have no complaints. I have all A and B grades, I can focus on my school work, and get things accomplished in a reasonable amount of time. Only critisicm I have is the fact that is caused me to go from messy to borderline OCD. However, I like cleaning and I see it as a plus side to the medication. As is usual for ADD and ADHD medicines, I experience easy mood swings and sudden out bursts of anger, loss of appetite, and lack of sleep. However, overall I am extremely pleased as a high schooler who was struggling.""",1
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I was given this medication to help my daily chronic headaches. Started it a little over a month ago. Three days in I had one of the worst headaches ever. After that the headaches started to diminish. I now have weakness and loss of feeling in my hands arms and legs and feet, seizure activity, confusion, and sleeping all the time. I don&#039;t feel like myself and I&#039;m super miserable all the time. Dr doesn&#039;t want to take me off this medication but I cannot live life like this. I don&#039;t recommend this medication.""",9
Bupropion,Anxiety,"""Was prescribed the generic for Wellbutrin, and the first day I felt great. But when I woke up the next morning and went to school, I was dizzy, nauseous and anxious. I had to go home early, and it felt like I had zero energy. Barely left my bed. I took it again and symptoms didn&#039;t seem to ease up. Now on day 3 I have been throwing up, and weak. I didn&#039;t feel like I had depression before, just anxiety. Now I have symptoms of both. Pharmacy told me to stop taking it.""",7
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m currently 27 years old. Just Had a baby girl. Mother of 3. Drs told me that I have to wait 3 months before implanting the IUD, Mirena. So I went ahead and got on the depo shot today. The shot was quick and painless. I haven&#039;t felt any symptoms yet. Will keep you updated. Im currently breastfeeding as well. So I honestly do not want any more kids. So hopefully this birth control won&#039;t be as bad as the reviews.""",8
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Hi,
I just started my Retin A experience. I know it will end well because the reviews are really good. Well, I can&#039;t say it is a miracle product because I am in the &quot;purge&quot; at the moment. You say it will return to smooth acne free skin in a few months? Can&#039;t wait! I have been using Acne.org&#039;s routie for about a year and it really did work. However, it is time for a permanent solution. My mom said she started Retin A when she was a few years older than me. I am 18. I am on 0.025 Treitonin cream. I apply at night and a little extra dab on new pimples. My mom gave me some pointers: BE SURE to wait 20 mins after you wash your face before you apply. Always wear sunscreen during the day. I like the Babo Zinc block. Apply on neck too.""",4
Tramadol,Pain,"""I was prescribed Tramadol because I couldn&#039;t tolerate other pain meds with codeine or Tylenol.
Tramadol is great until you run out.

I have taken this drug for approximately 7 years now.
I wish I&#039;d never started it.
It&#039;s just been a roller coaster for me it helps me feel better, but does zero for the pain &amp; then you build a tolerance up &amp; it just gets worse from there.

I&#039;ve had withdrawals from this a few times. I&#039;ve never had such horrible withdrawals as with this med, sneezing, coughing, hot, cold, chills, sweats, restless, depressed &amp; irritable to name a few with lethargy.

I am due for a refill tomorrow I&#039;m not picking it up. It&#039;s really hard right now, but going through this agony isn&#039;t an option again.""",9
Citalopram,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for almost a year now and it&#039;s been wonderfully helpful.  I&#039;ve had depression/anxiety on and off for years (as well as hypothyroidism).  However, I was always hesitant to take any medication that I didn&#039;t feel was &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;, so I never took anti-depressants before trying Celexa.  Initially, I started with 20 mg and that worked well for a couple of months, but then I needed to go up to 40mg and that has been the dosage that works consistently for me.  Other than the first few weeks of treatment, I&#039;ve had NO bad side effects whatsoever. It has really increased my sex drive (which has been non-existent for years).  """,5
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve taken Ambien more than 10yrs ago had a scary reaction,  I&#039;ve also taken OTC Sleep Aids including Benadryl is a complete waste sometimes with Benadryl I&#039;d end up waking up in middle of night having to take more &amp; so on!  LUNESTA IS THE ONLY THING THAT EVER WORKED FOR ME. I&#039;d take it 30 mins before bed but my husband would literally have to pick me up off couch and put me in bed because it worked faster than 30 mins I&#039;d wake up feeling fabulous...I also can tell you when I was pregnant in my last trimester they gave me 5mg of Ambien bc they didn&#039;t know much about Lunestas effects during pregnancy...so I took half of 5mg didn&#039;t work took entire 5mg didn&#039;t work!  LOVE LUNESTA!""",0
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""What you read about Lunesta&#039;s taste is so right. Lunesta is GROSS. Is took about 20 minutes for the &quot;taste&quot; that everyone complains about to show up. It did not help me sleep at all. I was half awake all night and when I was asleep I was having weird dreams. It&#039;s 12 hours later and every time I sip water or anything it still tastes like I chewed a tylenol or something. &quot;Bitter&quot; or &quot;metallic&quot; taste is an understatement. Did not work, tasted horrible. If I could give this back to the pharmacy I would. Back to Ambien for me.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hey everyone! I found all of these post super helpful! I just started phentermine 37.5 yesterday 04/12/2016 and I&#039;m super excited to see how it will work for me. I currently weigh 248 and it drives me crazy that I let myself gain so much weight. I have always been smaller in size &amp; I gained a lot of weight fast. I first tried toprimate but I took myself off of it because it made my face and hands feel like the pins &amp; needles after your foot falls asleep! So far with phentermine I have had a super dry mouth, hopefully that is the only side effect I have to deal with. I will re post in about a month with my progress. Wish me luck!!!""",3
Contrave,Obesity,"""6&#039;3&quot; and 314 lbs when I started Contrave nearly 3 weeks ago.  I&#039;m still ramping up the dosage.  Right now I&#039;m at 304.  No side effects so far for me.  Appetite is way down and cravings nearly gone.  Have to watch my blood sugar closely from getting too low.    Ramping down on diabetes meds.  Blood pressure is lower than it has been in years.  Portion control is much easier than I ever remember.""",2
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I took one 20mg pill. It works, I slept better than I had in years, sleep quality better than anything I had ever taken before. The problem was the next day. I was so sedated that I literally couldn&#039;t think or remember words. I felt nauseous all day and that night I almost fainted after eating dinner.

I didn&#039;t take the pill the next night and couldn&#039;t sleep at all. I had to take a double dose of benzos, melatonin and an Aleve because I was so achy. The next evening I went out with friends and had a few drinks. I was acting aggressively, obnoxious and completely out of character. 

I hope they come up with a better version of this drug. I&#039;m sad I can&#039;t take it due to side effects.""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have tried many different options for weight loss including weight loss surgery. Nothing has worked so far. I started taking Contrave 6 weeks ago and have lost 12 pounds so far. I am so pleased. The only side effect I seem to have so far is some sleepiness. As long as I am up and moving this does not bother me. What it seems to do is stop the cravings and give me the will power to keep me from eating. I stop when I am full and have no desire to snack at night. I am not really doing much for exercise at this point as I have such back problems because of my weight that anything I do is painful for me. I am hoping once I have gone down in weight a little exercise will be easier.""",2
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Manic bi-polarism for 7  years.  Know I&#039;m a type &quot;A&quot; person,  Depokote, Effexer, zanix.  I come from the medical field, lab and had seen people come in for blood work on everything from lithium to thorazine.  I have (with M.D. agreement) backed down from 500mg ER Depokote, to 250mg ER every evening along with a sleeping pill. The sleeping pill is new, so next time I will give the name.  When &quot;they&quot; found me, I was so gone into what we call our &quot;BLACK HOLE&quot;. I truly have no idea what all they tried....BUT the Depakote, according to my wife (Nurse for 34 yrs)
was my marriage and life saver.""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I take Ambien once a night...so long as I don&#039;t eat 2 hours or less before I take it...it seems to work great. I get a good 9 hours sleep. If I eat after I take it then it only makes me sleepy..not enough to fall asleep. So I don&#039;t eat before or after and I have great results. When I first started taking Ambien, I had bad dreams and nightmare. I even sleep walk and drive and did not remember a thing...but that stopped about 2 years after taking them..scary! You have to control the medicine..not let it control you. I&#039;ve been taking since 1997 and still taking them.""",0
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am 28 years old. I&#039;m a cook in an extremely fast paced, high profile kitchen needless to say celebritys love to have their weddings there. When I take my Vyvanse I can cook at a 100% capacity for the whole 8 hrs. Laser focused, good mood, feel I can do another 300 covers after we&#039;re done, don&#039;t need any help in the line. It&#039;s just wow. If you work in a place where you&#039;re under high pressure and quality is demanded this is your drug. I&#039;ve always had ADD since I was small. My mother was too negligent to do anything about it I was a failure in high school and it really sucked. I would read things and be like &quot; what?&quot; Lol I was bad now I take 60mg I take one around 1pm to help me through my work.""",1
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""I have been taking melatonin every night for about 3 years and it works good for me! I have never had my sleep problem &quot;diagnosed&quot;....but I can tell you that if I don&#039;t take something to MAKE me fall asleep I can easily stay awake for at least 36 hours and then in order to fall asleep I still have to take something! I have tried Tylenol PM and sometimes use pain pills and muscle relaxers (ruptured disc in my neck) and I still need melatonin with any of them! 
I have noticed that I seem to need more than I started out taking.""",0
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I have started taking Adipex 5 days ago and I have lost eight pounds already. This is a wonderful drug. I have been on and off of it for years. You can lose weight very fast with this pill. It really works if you want to lose weight. You may experience dry mouth. You don&#039;t feel hungry, you have to make yourself eat. I haven&#039;t been doing any kind of workouts, but plan to start. I go back to my doctor 8-26-10. She said that I would have to lose 6 pound if I want to get more. I started out at 187 and now I am 179.""",3
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I have had my battles with the inability to stay asleep of 10 or 12 years.  Go to sleep just fine but wake up at the 5 hour interval and cannot get back to sleep.  I would get very tired during the day - it was terrible.  I heard of this at Costco and started taking 1/2 tab per night.  Bang!  8 hours of great sleep!!!  I don&#039;t have drowsiness and feel like I used to.  It doesn&#039;t know me out - I can wake up to go to the bathroom. ( I am over 55 and a guy) but I go right back to sleep.  Love this stuff.  I hope it&#039;s not bad for ya because I need  good sleep.""",0
Concerta,ADHD,"""This medication is amazing!! Be patient and try it! All ADHD medications (like any other medication for anything) have side-effects but I have learned Concerta&#039;s do go away once you let your body do the talking: push through the 1-6 days of anxiety/depression/hyperactivity, etc., and be open to what it can do for you once your body gets used to it. I am 21 years old and I am on 54mg AND I take a side-effect medication called INTUNIV XR (2mg) that cured the anxiety side-effect which I found to come about half way through the day and when the Concerta was wearing off. This side effect comes about because Concerta is not a gradual release but 2 releases of the medicine- it drops off and may cause anxiety for a short time during the day.""",1
Abilify,Depression,"""I took Abilify with Celexa for one night. It seemed to work pretty well as soon as I took it. However, only three hours later, I was sitting on the couch when suddenly my arm lifted up and flung itself over the arm rest. I didn&#039;t even feel a muscle twitch. I wouldn&#039;t have even known had I not seen it move and felt it flop against the rest. It was bizarre. Two other incidents happened that same night, so I called my doctor in a panic who told me not to take the next dose. They took me off it immediately.

It allowed me to feel more relaxed. However, the side effect was so bad I couldn&#039;t even attempt to do a month of treatment without possibly injuring myself.""",5
Sronyx,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Sronyx for 4 months now. Everybody has a different reaction to different birth control pills but Sronyx is perfect for me. No bloating or weight gain, no breakouts, no mood swings, no period cramps at all (I previously had debilitating ones for several days out of the month), I know exactly when my period will start and end (used to be irregular), and best of all, no pregnancy! My breasts got slightly bigger and ached for about a month and a half, I did have breakthrough bleeding the first month I was on the pill, and the two times I&#039;ve missed a pill and had to take 2 in one day it did make me nauseous, but all those things are completely to be expected. Overall, this pill is perfect for me.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started phentermine 37.5mg in March 2011 and weighed in at 180. By the end of April I was down 20lbs to 160. It gave me energy and really suppressed my hunger, but I had horrible dry mouth, constipation, irritability, and had to force myself to eat. Since I stopped, I have gained 10 lbs back in 7 months and is entirely my fault. I have started it back up again because to me the side effects are worth the outcome. It loses it&#039;s potency after a couple of months, but still suppresses the hunger more than without it. As long as I am dedicated to the program, I should be able to take off the 10lbs I gained and then some within 2 months time. My realistic goal weight is 145 and is totally doable with healthy habits.""",3
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""I HAVE MY LIFE BACK. Currently taking 2mg day 8, with 50mg Lamictal, 50 mg Seroquel, Lexapro, elavil and Klonopin. Started with the 5 mg, 1st day slept all day, 2nd day increased back pain, 3rd day woke up with severe sweats lasted 7 hours. The nurse said don&#039;t take it tonight and come in for 2 mg. IT WORKED. I am no longer sleeping 12 hrs a night and playing computer games 7 hrs a day. I WANT to go out, shop, dress up, wearing makeup doing hair. People literally don&#039;t recognize me. Everybody wants to know what I&#039;m doing to feel so good. FINALLY! I have CPTSD, MDD, Bipolar 2, OCD that I know of. I pray it lasts. I am a little on the manic side, but I suppose I will mellow out in time. THANKS MAKERS OF ABILIFY!""",5
Desvenlafaxine,ADHD,"""Wow. Pristiq is AMAZING. I&#039;ve had severe depression since I was 13/14 and have been on everything under the sun. Nothing has worked as well as Pristiq. The only side effects I have noticed are:

1) Increased happiness
2) Easier to organize thoughts
3) Increased motivation
4) Decreased appetite
5) Lows aren&#039;t as low 
6) Less irritable 

I&#039;m currently looking for something to pair with Pristiq to get my ADHD in check. Hopefully I can find something!""",1
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""This is a very good diet pill.  I have been able to lose 15 pounds fairly easily combining Adipex with the Atkins diet.  I don&#039;t have cravings, my appetite is normal and doesn&#039;t drive me crazy all day.  I&#039;ve been taking Adipex for about 8 months now and have no side effects whatsoever.  I did try the generic brand which was made by a different company and I did have the side effect of not being able to sleep.  So I stick with the name brand.""",3
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I started taking this medication since I was 18 years old on and off. Let me put it in simple terms it is highly addictive. Yes it cured my anxiety but temporary only as long as I was on it. Miss a day and you want to crwal out of your own skin. The withdrawls are horrendous. Xanax just masks the problem. As soon as I got back on it my brain just wants it and thats all I think about. Valarian root is healthier and natural think twice before taking Xanax. Go for natural products if you can.""",7
Topiramate,Obesity,"""Excellent!  My doctor has combined this with Phentermine and I average a healthy 1.75 lbs of weight loss per week without excercise (due to pulled hamstrings).  I do not take the Phentermine full dose, nor do I take it every day.  My doctor follows me closely and I pay close attention to how I feel and go by instinct.  My overall health and well being is more important than losing weight.  I am very cautious and choose the right foods e.g., protiens, green veggies, lots of water, fruits and fiber.  I am sure to get proper rest to stay mentally sound.  Losing weight is good for me, but is taxing on my body and I am going to do what I have to in order to develop healthy long term habits (which take at least 30 days to develop).""",2
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been diagnosed with Bipolar.  Initially, I really did not believe that I had this disorder.  However, I feel so much better after 1 month on this medicine.  I feel normal for the first time in 4 years.  I am happy and energetic.  I also notice a significant improvement in my memory and concentration.  Since the medication has made a significant improvement in my quality of life, I am no longer in denial.""",6
Duragesic,Pain,"""I started on the patch approximately 6 yrs ago with a 0.50 patch for low back pain. Due to withdrawal symptoms on the third day, (sweating, chills, fatigue) I was increased to a 0.75 patch and then again to a 0.100 patch. I&#039;ve been on it for two years and with the exception of the first 36-48 hrs. I have side-effect problems that are terrible. I have lost all my upper teeth due to gum loss and decay, this just after spending $2000 to get my teeth put into shape.  I go from hot flashes and drenching sweats to chills every 10 to 15 minutes.  I have severe backache, headache and urine retention. The patch did wonders for my pain, but long term, the side-effects aren&#039;t worth it for me.""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""This drug has changed my life. I have ADD and depression. I used to not be able to get out of bed for a week at a time. Now I&#039;m loving life hanging out with friends and happy for the first time in a long time. I&#039;ve tried a few other ADD medicines they didn&#039;t really help me. I like the Methyln generic much more than any of them.  The only problem I have with it is that I don&#039;t like to stop taking it and go to bed, kinda like addicted to it while on it, but ONLY when I&#039;m on it. Before I could go all day and not crave it, been on it a year now. It&#039;s just when I take my first one hard for me to not want to stay on it because I enjoy life so much more.""",1
Accutane,Acne,"""I  am 24 and have had med. level acne on my face for many years, and more recently on my shoulders. I started Accutane March 2016 at 20mg. Apr 30mg and next week -May 40mg. Symptoms in March; chapped lips, dry face, body aches, blurry vision, new oil pimples. April- My symptoms changed to; eyes sensitive to sunlight, heart burn with greasy foods, body aches, dryness, dry hair/split ends/thinner hair, and my skin has a slower healing process now so any pimples I have touched will stay for weeks. Also, I have noticed that on the days I do drink one gallon of water or more my symptoms go away. I also eat healthy and I try to take daily vitamins. Choose a reputable derm!""",4
Butorphanol,Pain,"""I was given butorphanol for severe abdominal pain related to Crohn&#039;s disease when none of the typical meds worked for me. It is amazingly effective. The first time I took this nasal spray my pain disappeared in about 7 minutes. Nothing has ever worked for my pain before until taking this. And since I have Crohn&#039;s disease, the nasal spray is brilliant because it doesn&#039;t go through the digestive system and cause other symptoms. Made me a little sleepy, but less each time I take it. It&#039;s been a miracle for me.""",9
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""I absolutely had to share that after taking this medicine, I too cut my hair in the night. I&#039;m over forty years old. 
Not being aware I had cut my hair, I woke up and when I hopped out of bed that morning, both feet landed in a pile of hair. While funny, this is not good at all. I understand this is the same class of drug that is used for sedation during surgery. Look up the risks involved to memory and comprehension. Long term, permanent side effects. 
I admit, this medication put me to sleep, but never through the entire night. Oh, yeah and then there was the time I woke up with a chocolate candy bar melted to the side of my face. Again, funny but I was really angry to have wasted a candy bar. Ok ok, yeah I ate the candy bar. Come on, I had to.""",0
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""By chance I started taking Depakote around the time that my SAD normally kicks in and after a month it had stopped it dead in it&#039;s tracks; no depression and only very mild manic episodes. I&#039;m also now experiencing a sense of inner calm and mental clarity than I ever thought possible. No side effects other than vivid dreams and some weight gain, which is par the course for me this time of year anyway and a small price to pay for the improvements I&#039;m seeing.""",6
Desvenlafaxine,Bipolar Disorde,"""My doctor replaced Prozac with Pristiq in hopes it would be more effective in fighting my depression.  At first I thought I was in heaven.  I&#039;m in my late 50&#039;s and never felt this good ever.  I also lost 30 lbs!  As time passed, I became more and more manic. (not a feel good manic either).  Had to get off of it.  Shame.  When it was working for me it was better than anything I&#039;ve ever tried.""",6
Citalopram,Depression,"""I suffered from depression for 4 years and started taking Citalopram 6 months back. I&#039;ve never felt better. I could finally rid myself of the voices in my head and feel positive about my myself and people around me. This has improved my relationship with my husband greatly.

Side effects: I started clenching my jaw while sleeping and used to wake up with a jaw ache. It continued for about 3 months but luckily has gone away.

The more serious side effect is the dip in sex drive. It has gone away completely and I don&#039;t feel ANYTIHNG. I can&#039;t reach orgasm, don&#039;t get wet and don&#039;t get aroused at all. I am hoping it will come back after I stop taking it.

Overall I am very happy with the medicine for turning my life around.""",5
Lutera,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this pill for about 3 months.  In this time, I&#039;ve gained some weight.  I go to the gym 5-6 times a week and am a pretty health conscious person so there is no reason for this to happen.  I&#039;ve never had a problem with my skin but over the last 3 months I haven&#039;t gone a day without a pimple on my face, and my back and chest are not okay.  I feel so gross.  I do so much to take care of myself and after looking at my daily life, the only thing I can attribute these things to is my pill.  It is also the only medication I take.""",8
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I took Adipex (37.5) from February 2012-April 2012 and in that span of time I went from 300 lbs down to 170 lbs. That is a loss of 130 lbs. I hardly ate  anything but grilled chicken, fruit, and powerade. I walked at least 2 miles everyday. I got Pregnant at the end May 2012 so I had to stop taking it. My baby is now 2 years and 5 months and my weight has gone back up to a very uncomfortable 240 lbs. I still exercise regularly but not as often as I should. I have an appointment in 3 weeks to get adipex again and I am hoping and praying that I have the same results as before. This is a great aid in loosing weight for anybody who struggles with loosing weight by diet alone. Wish me luck...will update in 90 days!!!""",2
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got the nexplanon against my better judgment. I just don&#039;t feel like having a mini surgery for birth control is worth it and niether do I feel like having small scars on your arm is worth it as well. I had the nexplanon for about six months and I immediatly started having crazy heavy periods not only were they heavy as a wind storm they would come and go in the same month. I had brought so many pads it was ridiculous. I gained a bunch of weight, I started having pregnancy side effects and that is what made me take the stick out. I was so scared I thought I might be pregnant and  I feared for my baby. I hurried and got it taken out. I won&#039;t use anymore birth control I&#039;m concerned about health side effects in the long run.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""Been on Contrave for three weeks and have lost 8lbs. I just started taking three pills a day. It took me longer to go up on dosage than it should have,but it took my body longer to adjust. I did have the jitters and did get nauseous when I upped the dosage, but now I feel ok. I definitely get full quicker and no longer snack. I also noticed my craving dissipating. I am training with the couch to 5k, bc on May 16th I&#039;ll be doing my second 5k!""",2
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Loestrin 24 for about 8 months. Since I&#039;ve been on it I have lost my sex drive, can&#039;t sleep, slurred speech, headaches, you name it. I was happy to see other users have had similar side effects. I have been going crazy thinking something was wrong and now I know it&#039;s the pill! I have to say an upside to the pill is I started with short, light periods and now I don&#039;t even get my period at all. But the side effects are just too much to handle so I&#039;m getting off this pill.""",8
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""I have had an extended bout of situational depression after my mother died.  Abilify definitely helped with motivation for me, so far it has been the best medication in this regard.  However, the constant sensation of heat and flu like symptoms are quite bothersome, (worse than a hot menopausal hot flash) but the insomnia will ultimately prevent me from taking this medication as I need to be able to drive.""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""When I was a teenager I suffered from terrible acne and scars.  I was put on Accutane and while I was quite moody, it was totally worth it because when I was done my skin was flawless.  I was never happier.  My skin stayed this way for years until my doctor informed me that the hormone changes during pregnancy were probably the cause for my acne resurfacing.  My birth control was helping. It wasn&#039;t until I got a blood clot in my chest and was told I could never take birth control again that it got worse.  I never realized how much the birth control was helping.  My skin got so bad I never wanted to leave the house.  I am going back on Accutane in a few days and praying I get the same results I did 15 years ago.""",4
Focalin,ADHD,"""My daughter (8 yrs old) started taking Focalin 5 weeks into this school year.  Her teacher agrees that it is working wonderfully for her.  She is focused and her grades are great.  She was struggling to read, to make it through a regular school day, to do homework and to get along. We asked her how she feels on Focalin and she said &quot; I feel so much better&quot;.  She is on 15 mg once daily and it is SUPER.""",1
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on Latuda for about 4-5 months, after taking myself off Seroquel. Latuda seemed promising as it has less metabolic side effects than other atypical antipsychotics. However, Latuda immediately gave me severe anxiety (which added klonopin to my daily regiment). Towards the end of the 4-5 months, I began developing recurring and intense dark thoughts immediately after increasing my Latuda dosage. I instantly took myself off of the drug and am searching for a new atypical antipsychotic to fill its place. I know that Latuda has worked very well for some, but I want to add a warning that it can cause severe anxiety. Monitor your symptoms carefully with your doctor.""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Got the Skyla 10/1/15 and it all took 10 minutes. I had two mild cramps then one last sharp cramp(lvl 6) as insertion was happening then back to mild(lvl 2) day-long cramps along with spotting. Had cramps off and on for the next couple of days then they went away. I get PMS and very mild cramps for a bit when my period is about to start. Period lasts 4 days followed by spotting/brown discharge. So far I love everything about Skyla. I do not have any mood swings, no acne, no weight gain, same high libido I had before I was on Skyla. The only concern I have is with spotting. I&#039;ve been spotting nonstop since insertion. Had only 4 clear days on 2nd week of November then back to spotting. Will give it more time and post experience soon again!""",8
Minocycline,Acne,"""I was put on minocycline for my acne. About 2 weeks later, I woke up and could not move a bone or muscle in my body. I went to the doctor and they did not know what it was. My acne cleared up however, this pain in my bones was horrendous. I was told I was just stressed by one doctor, had arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis. I am a very active 20 year old girl. It actually got to the point where it was ruining my life. I went to TEN doctors and I finally figured out myself I had drug induced lupus from forums like this which the doctors agreed. It took me a year for me and doctors to realize. I was injected with 2 cortisone shots in my buttocks and feel better but still not 100%. This drug has ruined my body. Please be careful.""",4
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I have gave quitiapine 5 stars as it definitely allows me to sleep right through the night. But I have been on it for 15 years and still experience dreadful side effects. I have reduced from taking 800mg in the morning to 300mg in the morning yet in the evening and the morning I can barely function and am tired and groggy all day. I have tried to take it earlier and earlier in the evening in the hope of having less side effects in the morning but nothing works. Plus it gives me the appetite of a racehorse. I also have nasty withdrawal symptoms whenever I try to taper off completely. For me this drug is a necessary evil and I really wish I didn&#039;t have to take it.""",0
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""Well this medication worked well for me for the first few years but as time went on the side effects got gradually worse. I&#039;m am now totally paranoid and suffering from severe anxiety disorder. I am trying to come off this medication to deal with these side effects. To anyone taking this medication get off it now before you end up like I did. And despite what your doctor tells you it is a addictive!! Worst mistake of my life..""",7
Differin,Acne,"""I began to have breakouts after the mastectomies...had to take hormonal pills.  I tried so many things, went to dermotologist and tried stuff.  What really worked was a skin regimen and taking a low does antibiotic (doxycycline)  Then my daughter told me about Differin.  I have been on this for almost 3 months.  There has been some good clearing up, dry patches where the blemishes were.  My face is very oily and so this didn&#039;t bother me.  I never moisturize because of the oil..all of them make my skin break out even more.  Expect to have some breakouts as you get used to this.  I am almost down to the wire, things are clearing up slowly but surely.  Medicare doesn&#039;t not cover lots of meds like this so OTC""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started Phentermine on 4/18/12. Starting weight at 170 lbs. I started taking it because having changed my diet and exercising, I could never lose weight. I have always had an athletic build, but after my third child, I could not lose the weight and gained more. So when I started phentermine, I changed my diet again, starting with a light breakfast such as oatmeal, one hour after I take the pill. Every few hours I have a light meal. And I exercise about 2 hours a day. Usually walk 2 miles and then an hour of weights. I just started my 4th week on phentermine and have lost 17 lbs. All phentermine is really doing is training me on how to eat properly again. Weight loss is about portion control and exercising.""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started the pill on 10/9/15 I was 172.2 at the doctors, I&#039;m a 24 year old female, 4&quot;11 tall, weighed myself today 10/29/15 and I&#039;m 11 pounds lighter! I&#039;m 161.3!  No cravings for sweets which I have/had a HORRIBLE sweet tooth, stopped eating fast food as much, cut it out more than half, can&#039;t wait to see more progress. I work 6 days a week as a stylist and have a 5 year old in school full time, working out is hard but I try to fit 30 min in either in the morning or at night, I use myfitnesspal to track my calorie intake, 1200 a day mostly less, dry mouth but as long as I drink my water all day I&#039;m good. Will update next month!""",2
Accutane,Acne,"""I was prescribed Accutane when I was 17 years old for the first time. In the beginning of the treatment it got worse but after that it just got better and better and better. I am on another 4 month course. I am currently on my 6th week and my skin has just gotten bad breakouts but I know it will all clear up. Accutane is the best thing anyone can ever do for themselves. It does have its side effects but so does everything in life. For the dryness I use Blistex medicated lip ointment and Clinique moisturizer. Stick it out. It is all worth it at the end of the day. I love Accutane.""",4
Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""I have only been on the patch for about a month, but I think that it&#039;s long enough for me to have a somewhat legit opinion on this medicine. So far, so good. I was on the pill before I started this, and I never remembered to take it. I would be hours late, sometimes missing it all together, and being sexually active, that&#039;s pretty risky. I love that I only have to change it once a week. I hate how sometimes it sticks to my underwear, and when I pull them down to use the restroom, they pull on it. But that&#039;s all about where on the butt you put it. I&#039;m on my patch off week and I&#039;m having awful cramping. That&#039;s the only downfall. All in all, great.""",8
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""After several years of Zoloft use for GAD, I went off of it, under my dr&#039;s supervision. Felt Ok, then last year, had a lot of chronic pain, back &amp; arthritis...heard that Cymbalta was good for all those--pain, depression and anxiety. Psych doc gave me samples, seemed to kick in pretty well &amp; quickly. I have gone through 3 major surgeries in the last 18 months--and went off the Cymbalta b/c I thought I could handle it...Nope, I&#039;m a mess. Needed daily clonazepam to cope. I just went though a 3rd and (Hopefully!!) final surgery 5 weeks ago. Hadn&#039;t taken any Cymbalta for months. I am going back on. Just got thru the worst anxiety attacks in my life following the 3rd surgery. I think the dose for me was 60mgs, and I will start it up again.""",7
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""Just found out after 4 months of using this drug 40mg a day for anxiety that it can cause HEART FAILURE in otherwise healthy adults. In low dose this drug will definitely stop the pounding heart beat but I notice if I have a panic attack my heart still races. I&#039;m sure if you took 80mg a day that wouldn&#039;t be a problem though. Shortness of breath too after taking, I&#039;d strongly advise against this drug. Find something else.""",7
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Belviq since around the end of Aug. 2014. (I&#039;m unable to do much exercising because I am disabled so I&#039;m guessing this is why my story isn&#039;t like everyone else&#039;s.) I have lost around 25lbs. give or take since I started. NOT what I wished for BUT so much MORE than I could EVER do on my own. (especially with all of my medical problems). For this, I AM VERY HAPPY with this product and can only hope it WILL continue to work as it has, or if I&#039;m lucky, even better! Either way it&#039;s been great!""",3
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Abilify on two separate occasions along with other medications to help with depression and bipolar. BOTH times was a disaster. This time I&#039;ve tried to tough out the side effects (working on three months now) and I still can&#039;t deal with the way it makes me feel. I feel flat, tired, depressed, low motivation, worthless, hopeless. You name it. I see my doctor tomorrow And plan to demand stopping Abilify.""",6
Concerta,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD in 8th grade and put on 20mg of Concerta which has since risen to 54mg extended release in the day and 10mg immediate release in the evening for when I do my homework. At first the medicine was great- it allowed me to focus and my grades went up significantly. However over the past year or so I have been experiencing negative side effects such as depression, headaches, and loss of appetite. I can manage the headaches and appetite problems but as for the depression, it is so bad that I am considering switching to another brand or changing my dose because when I am on Concerta I become virtually emotionless, and as a result I am struggling to maintain good relationships with my friends and family members.""",1
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started with Duromine 30mg on 27/03/2014 weighing 84kg and I am currently (23/04/2014) 79kg which means I have lost 5kg to date. I only exercised once a week for two hours. I changed my diet a little bit by taking 2 slices of toasted brown bread, 1 egg and a fruit, lunch fruit &amp; a small portion protein, supper would only be 3 colorful veggies e.g.: carrots, beetroot &amp; spinach.  What I like about this is I can choose what I want to eat. I would highly recommend it to anyone who did not have the ability to control their appetite and crave for everything around.""",2
Opana ER,Pain,"""My insurance co would not fill a rx for oxycontin until I have tried opana &amp; a couple of others I&#039;ve never heard of. I was in a near fatal auto accident younger, I need a knee &amp; hip replacement, breast cancer at end of 2013 &amp; have had terrible time with infections, causing more surgeries.  I lay in bed usually 16 hrs a day (including sleep) because I hurt all over &amp; even more w/ house or yard chores . I&#039;m allergic to morphine, codeine, delaudid, Fentanyl, CT scan dye - I can take only Demerol after surgery. At home the only med that I am not allergic to is oxycontin &amp; ultram. I am now trying opana, because of my insurance company.  I&#039;m supposed to take 1 -20mg 2x/day. I am very disappointed. What little relief in gave me was only for about 2 hrs.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started the pills August 20th. I haven&#039;t been to the gym yet, but I eat SUPER healthy now and a lot less than I used to; and I have lost 8 pounds within 5 days!!! It&#039;s so crazy. I barely am ever hungry and I get so full so fast. I do have dry mouth, but I drink a lot of water for it. My doctor said by eating good and exercise here and there I could loose up to 20 pounds in one month. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to loose another 50 pounds by the next 3 months!""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Been on this for a year and some change. Overall I love it, my boyfriend be I don&#039;t have to worry about any unwanted pregnancies and it helped regulate my BPD since I no longer have a period or should say didn&#039;t from before I put this in (depo shot previously). When on depo I had 1 period in 2 years and it was rough. Yesterday 7/31 I got one on nexplanon it&#039;ll be bad I can tell but still beyond worth it. 1 period every 2 years? Awesome. Not worrying for 3 years? Amazing. 

Just make sure you are aware of side effects. What works for me might not for you.""",8
Viibryd,Depression,"""I have had depression from age 12 and am now 40. I have used all SSRI&#039;s, Welbutrin, Effexor, etc., but would have to quit each one due to various side effects. Buspar &amp; Xanax helped but weren&#039;t strong enough. I was fed up! So I quit all depression medicines for 3yrs (not advisable!). I became more depressed than I had ever been in my life. I went back to a doctor and he put me on Viibryd. I was sceptical! But he explained how it was different. So I tried it. I used the gradual dose increase and I had bad nausea but it did eventually pass as long as I took it with a high protein breakfast. That was my only side effect. I have been on it for over a year and have never felt this well! I do get withdrawal symptoms if I miss a dose but to me it&#039;s still worth it!""",5
Topamax,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started this medication for weight lose, bipolar, migraines. Seems like it may just be perfect...hopefully. I just finished my first week and lost 3 pounds! I workout 5-6 days a week but due to antidepressants making me gain so much weight, regardless of my diet and exercise I am fat. So today stepping on that scale and seeing 3 POUNDS LIGHGTER! I am a very moody person but the medicine seems to be making it right, moods seem to be very level. And haven&#039;t had one migraine! No side effects other than weight loss and loss of appetite..can&#039;t complain about that!""",6
Vicodin,Pain,"""I had appendicitis and the pain after I had surgery was horrible. I&#039;m the sort of person who hates taking medicine, but I gave in and took some. It worked very well. I&#039;m not sure if it was because I couldn&#039;t sleep because of the pain or that the Vicodin made me drowsy, but I fell asleep around 30 minutes after I took it every time. A few months later when I had my wisdom teeth out, I also took Vicodin and it let me get sleep then too. No other side effects.""",9
Viibryd,Depression,"""I had tried everything.  Other drugs affected my sex life, made me gain weight, made me slow.  Viibryd has been a life saver.  The only thing that bothers me is that there won&#039;t be a generic for 3-5 years and without an HMO or Healthcare plan it is about $270 a month.  I am lucky to have been employed continuously the time I have been on it.  A tip - ask your doctor for sample packs and hoard them. A second tip - always google for coupons on any prescription.  Viibryd has some &quot;first year&quot; discounts""",5
Viorele,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on viorele for the past year and a half. At first, it was great! It got rid of my cramps, it regulated my period, and it worked in respects to preventing pregnancy, but for the past 6 months, I experienced a severe decrease in my libido, almost it was nonexistent. When I did want to have sex, I experienced severe pain, which I didn&#039;t experience prior. I was agitated and my anxiety and depression were worse. I&#039;m now looking for a different birth control.""",8
Gabapentin,Pain,"""First I must say this page and all the reviews I have just read helped me SOOOO much so thank you to everyone on here. I have suffered with lower back disc pain for about 30 years but I lived with it, I spent a crazy amount of money on physical therapy, chiropractors, and doctors with zero results. I finally was referred to a surgeon in Feb. of this year and told I have 3 herniated discs that would require surgery in July to repair them with metal ones. At that time I was put on 2 x 10mg of Percocets every 4 to 6 hours.  After 4 months I ended up in the E.R in excruciating pain. Dr. put me on gabapentin 2 times a day, I&#039;m on day 6 and I&#039;m pain free! Dry mouth is only side effect and slight dizziness, and down to 1 Percocet a day!""",9
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I&#039;m back on my journey. I started belviq Jan 3, 2017 start weight 372.4 I weight in every Monday week 1 down 11.4lb to 361,week 2  354 down 7lb,week 3 weigh in Monday morning will post up date.This comes from the HEART, before I drank so much coke it was shameful and ate how I wanted.  I had to change my way of thinking about food. I count calories like a mathematician, the loose it app is my holy grail. I know this is a journey.  Thank goodness  for the weight that will to come off. Don&#039;t give up under any measure.""",2
Accutane,Acne,"""I have struggled with severe acne since 12 years old, I am now 30. I tried EVERYTHING possible on the market, whether it be prescribed pills, or all kinds of prescribed lotions, but nothing worked. My acne was so bad that I contemplated suicide because of my shame. I thank God that Accutane is still available. I took it for about 5 months, and the acne vanished. It really brought me out of my shell, and house. I don&#039;t care about the negative remarks about it, I&#039;m thankful it&#039;s around.""",4
Strattera,ADHD,"""Diagnosed with having ADHD in my early 20&#039;s. Dr. wanted me to try out Strattera before a stimulant since I also have anxiety and he feared a med like Adderrall would make it worst. 

This is my second month on it and it does seem to be working. I am better able to concentrate and my head seems more &quot;clear&quot;. I&#039;m on 80mg. 

Stomach-aches and drowsiness started off horrible when I first began taking this med but these side effects are almost gone. Still get dry mouth which ranges from mild to &quot;it feels like I&#039;ve eaten cotton and sand&quot;.

Unless the side effects are too intense for you, I would at least give this med two months. Think it gets such a bad rep because people don&#039;t give it a chance.""",1
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""I am now able to focus, not as inattentive. For the first time in 23 years I am able to read and write without losing interest after a sentence. My brain no longer feels as though it is racing or &quot;Pinging&quot; like a party. I find I am more settled in social situations and my impulsiveness has reduced 80%. My dosage is 5mg (first dose) then 2.5mg every 3 afters there after. If I skip my dosage for more than a day, my mind starts wandering and I am severely inattentive and by day 2 my brain and body feels so full of energy I just want to be a menace and scream at everything whilst running a marathon (except I&#039;d get bored of running after 2 minutes ha ha). I wish I had not gone untreated for so long as this medication has saved my life.""",1
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this gel for probably about 2 or 3 years now. I started getting acne in around 6th grade where as I didn&#039;t start my period until 9th grade. I&#039;ve never had SEVERE acne, there&#039;s just always been at least a couple zits on my face for as long as I can remember. I had no significant peeling or dryness when I started using differin, and I also had no immediate results. Slowly over time, however, my acne is becoming less severe and less often. Maybe it&#039;s because of the differin, maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m growing out of it. I did stop using it last summer as a test and my skin got worse and worse for the entire month I stopped using it and it took a solid 3-4 months after I started using it again for my skin to return back to normal.""",4
Prozac,Depression,"""I am a 46 year old male. In 1988 I was going through a very serious bout with anxiety and depression. Luckily - there was a place called Freedom From Fear on Staten Island that was able to counsel me (free of charge, as was affiliated with Columbia University), and a doctor there prescribed for me a new drug that was just approved and available...Prozac. I took it for eight months or so and recovered - so much so that it helped me deal with the tragedy of my mother dying only a year later. Yes, this medicine saved my life. This is are the reason I am here right now. I only took the medicine for that eight months, and slowly got off it. Here I am 20 years later, totally fine!""",5
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I suffered from chin acne for about 5 years. The spots (I think hormonal) varied from the big under-your-skin ones to white heads and I would literally get a new one every few days. I&#039;d tried loads of different treatments from the docs, including antibiotics, and even went for face peels but nothing helped long term. My brother recommended tretinon and I was dubious at first but decided to give it a try. Bought the gel online (but I think you can get it from your doctors too). First few weeks I saw a huge improvement in the amount of I was getting although my skin did peel a fair bit. I started moisturising on alternate days and two months later the difference is incredible! Had no new spots for a month and even my acne scars are fading!""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the implant inserted in Feb of 2015 and have had it for about 10 months now. I have had no period since then. I have not experienced any spotting or mood swings. It is so convenient. I don&#039;t have to worry about condoms, taking a pill everyday, or spending money on tampons. Two of my former co workers had gotten it before me and loved it which convinced me to try it out. I am very happy with my choice.""",8
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I am someone that does NOT like to take medication.  I am an adult and I found out I was ADD back about 5 years ago and started taking Strattera for it.  I  am a slow metabolizer so was using 10 mg per day of Strattera.  Recently I felt the need to add some additional medication to help me focus a little better.  In reading about Daytrana, the thing I liked about it was that I knew I could cut the patch down in size (to 1/2 or 1/4) if I felt the dose was too high.  I usually am VERY sensitive to adhesives, but I&#039;ve been on it about 2 weeks now and have not had a problem at all. I clean the site where the patch had been with alcohol after I take it off and have not had any skin reactions.  The product is GREAT (10 mg dose patch).""",1
Vicoprofen,Pain,"""It is amazing pain relief. I built a tolerance so quickly! I could take 1 and feel so much better and soon it was one and a half 7.5s and weeks later two 7.5s. Lidoderm patch and TENS unit helped some but you feel like you need the medicine so very easy to convince your body that you NEED it. Gained 10 lbs. After 3 years and some physical therapy plus Neurontin. PM doctor switched me to Nucynta. No tolerance to that yet! They have injected my intercostal nerves with cortisone to see if it was nerve damage from the back to back pregnancies. Constipation has been horrible. I need two Vicoprofen 10s every 8 hours but oh well. Some relief is nice.""",9
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""After being on Ambien for years, at least years, for sleep, I decided I hated the mental fog.  My doctor prescribed Remeron. After several months of weight gain, I decided I had to lose the weight. I&#039;m 6&#039;5&quot; and I went from 310 LBs to 360 LBs in a matter of three months. Crazy, I know!
What I couldn&#039;t figure out was why I had an insatiable hunger. How bad was it? Usually, when I go out for wings, I order a ten piece. If I share an appetizer, I only eat 4; take 6 home for the next day. A few weeks ago, even after sharing an appetizer, I ate all ten wings, and when I got home I ate my wife&#039;s leftovers! So I ran out of Remeron and didn&#039;t get it refilled. After four days of being off it, my appetite is normal. Awful RX!!!""",0
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I starting taking Monodox to help with a acne breakout. It worked within 3 days and started drying out my acne, but after 2 weeks I stopped because it was irritating my stomach to much. My face was pretty cleared up but not perfect. I was supposed to be on it for a month. The weirdest thing was the day after I stopped the drug I began have extreme static electricity in my hair. I still have it and it has been 4 days. I Googled to see what it could be and found that people who are on Accutane have experienced the same. I hope it goes away, it is very irritating.""",4
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Knocks me out cold for 10 hours with no break in between. I wake up in the morning with my bladder ready to explode. But the sleep I got was not restful. I did not wake up feeling fresh. I started with 15mg and moved to 30mg after 2 weeks. It worked for 8 months that I took it. Then I stopped it to test myself. Have hardly slept in 2-1/2 months since then. May have to go back to Mirtazapine. But I am thinking of trying something else before I do that.""",0
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I tried buspar in addition to 200mg of zoloft. it was meant to enhance the zoloft. Unfortunately , it didn&#039;t work for me. I was on it for about 5 months, and during that time i kept having on and off discomfort , like my heart was beating harder,my stomach was always really bloated, my body heat would rise and I&#039;d have a hard time cooling down. The symptoms were so mild I didn&#039;t really pay much attention to it, but after a while i got tired of the negative side effects and decided to call it quits. Almost immediately after i stopped taking the medication, all of those negative symptoms went away so I definitely know it was the buspar. if anyone has similar side effects, just stop the medication after two weeks max, its not worth it.""",7
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I started Nucynta 100mg 3x/day because I have severe back problems. Norcos/Vicodin were not working. First day I was on it, it took about an hour to kick in (about 12am I got my prescription at 11pm). I had had bizarre/violent dreams. I took it before work (I didn&#039;t drive) and I have a desk job. I spent most of the day drooling. Day 2 great night sleep, no bizarre dreams fell asleep no problem. Went to work and was hot and sweaty (the office was at 69 degrees and it was raining), worst dry mouth you could imagine. No appetite and drank a ton of water. Day 3 diarrhea, sweaty, no appetite. As for the pain management it worked better than Vicodin but I still feel a burning.""",9
Demerol,Pain,"""I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s me or what but I was given Demerol (along with Vistaril and Vicodin) after my ankle surgery and it hasn&#039;t helped at all. I was admitted to the hospital twice where I received Dilaudid. That did the trick. I had a screw removed from my ankle, which had shattered and the doctor drilled through my fibula bone. After I was released, I was given Vicodin to be taken one hour after my Demerol and Vistaril. That seemed to work. I was surprised that the Demerol needed a &quot;kick&quot; so to speak. I would definitely ask my doctor for something more again if I ever had to go back on it.""",9
Citalopram,Depression,"""I am 28 year old female. I was prescribed 10 mg.  I read a lot of reviews on Celexa where people said they felt a difference the first week and was starting to get really disappointed when I felt no different in that time frame.  I have been on it for exactly 7 weeks now and am just now starting to notice a difference. My interests have returned, I have more energy, and I am able to focus.  Overall I am definitely happier and don&#039;t feel down in the dumps anymore.  The only side effect I had was it made me very tired in the beginning but that has gone away completely.  For me, Celexa is working!""",5
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""Hated it. Was prescribed 30 mg. Slept 14 hrs a day, restless leg syndrome, gained 40 lbs, moody and irritable constantly and anxiety ridden. Finally tired of this horrible drug, I researched a replacement. There isn&#039;t one. It&#039;s in a class of its own.  Desperate, I cut my pills all in half and let me tell you! 1 week later, I&#039;m the old me again, I feel energized after 8 hrs of sleep, no middle of the night candy cravings and I&#039;m finally able to talk to others without wishing they&#039;d shut the hell up! I feel like remeron took 2 years of my life from me.""",5
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I did a lot of research on different birth controls prior and Nuvaring seemed to be the best. So I gave it a try. I&#039;m taking it to control my hormonal mood swings and acne. The first 3 days, my sex drive was through the roof, mood swings gone but bloating instantly but then 5 days - a week later, bloating, depressed, angry mood swings, acne has gotten 10x worse especially on my back, weight/water gain, and now a week and half later I have cramps randomly. I also have been eating like crazy and crazy food at night and junk food. So basically its like I&#039;m on my period! I&#039;m going to give it another week or two until my cycle then I&#039;ll stop taking it. 

""",8
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I am an adult female. I was prescribed 10 mg once a day. My counselor advised my Behavioral Health MD to treat me for possible ADD/ADHD. I&#039;m also taking clonopin and Ambien, which might account for my reaction- Ritalin made me sleepy and kind of depressed! I was really surprised, as I&#039;d never heard of that reaction. Also taking Lamictal and Trileptal for bipolar. Hm.... I sure would like to know if others have this reaction, or if upping the dose would possibly make me not so depressed.""",1
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""Effexor was a mixed bag for me -  it was very numbing, and the side effects (which lingered for years after I stopped taking it) were awful. I attempted suicide a few weeks after starting it, because I was still depressed but was more numbed to the guilt I would usually feel. Be careful of this, make sure someone is aware if you feel at risk. It took a few months, but I began to feel positive things again, but eventually I was stuck in a zombie state where the side effects outweighed the good. I tried it on a few occasions with the same result: taking myself off them because I wanted to feel again. The best advice I can give is to see a psychiatrist, not a GP. There is a range of medicines, make sure you get the one that is tailored to YOU.""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My 8yr old daughter has been on Vyvanse for almost 2yrs. She started on 20mg a day, she seemed to be doing better as far as focusing, but very emotional. Her doctor decided to up her dose to 30mg and now 40mg. The 40mg also seemed to help at school her grades went up and she was able to pay attention. I&#039;m now noticing that my little girl is not the same person, she&#039;s has become rude, depressed, emotional, getting in trouble, suicidal and just out of control. Parents really should keep a journal of changing side effects they notice. Needless to say my daughter is no longer taking this medication and not yet found one to replace it.""",1
Doxycycline,Acne,"""Update!- As below I stated that doxycycline and Epiduo did an outstanding job. It continued to do so for 1 and a half months but they say all good things come to an end. Because I was getting used to the tetracycline antibiotic,  I started getting little pimples-definitely not as bad as before so my dermatologist switched me over to Oratane for the cure. I really am so happy doxycycline kick started my clear skin. Don&#039;t forget to moisturize and sunscreen!""",4
Adapalene,Acne,"""I have combination/acne prone skin but have only ever had a mild problem until I bought a &#039;natural&quot; ebay kit that changed everything. It completely ruined my skin with a huge flare up and immediate dark marks. After that experience I bought tons of other acne products to combat this problem to no avail. My mom works at walmart and told me about differin gel so she brought it home in the morning. I washed my face with my zinc soap prescribed by my derm and dabbed a small amount of gel on my right cheek. In the morning I was beyond surprised to discover a painful cluster of RED acne on that spot so I stopped using this (I&#039;m a light-skinned black girl btw)""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I have just completed my first month of Amnesteem (I had moderate acne) and I am extremely happy with the results this far. However, I experienced stomach ache, nausea, constipation, chest pain, head aches, lower back pain, sore throat, dry skin, extremely chapped lips, and fatigue. They all hit me at the beginning of week three. The good news is they all subsided by the end of the week except the constipation.""",4
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had my Kyleena in for approximately 30 hours, and I am very pleased with my decision so far! I am 19, and have never had any kids or been pregnant, so I feared that the pain would be unbearable. Overall, the insertion was super easy and I only had a tiny cramp during the whole process. I received numbing shots and took ibuprofen an hour before. I was able to immediately get up and ended up going to work about an hour later. Since then, I have only had a few minor cramps and some spotting. Overall, I am very happy that I didn&#039;t listen to some negative reviews and decided to go through with it! I will update if anything changes in the coming weeks.""",8
Kapvay,ADHD,"""My 6 yo tried this after Intuniv failed. It made him constantly tired and irritable, and actually made his impulsiveness worse since he just seemed cranky and emotional all of the time. It also constipated him to the point that ended up with fissures.

It never made a meaningful dent in his ability to concentrate or sit still, and he became more argumentative in school and less willing to comply.

I&#039;ve yet to meet anyone that these work for, but it sure would be nice if there were a non-stimulant that worked. We&#039;re on stimulants now and still haven&#039;t found a miracle there, either.

I will say that it didn&#039;t affect his appetite, which was nice.""",1
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been prescribed to take this medicine twice a day for 15 days and have really bad cystic acne. I&#039;m about a week in and I think I&#039;m in the purging period. All of the deep cysts in my face are becoming nodules!! I hope this goes away fast. I suggest not using many other products with this as it makes your skin super sensitive and I&#039;ve been having a really red face if I use anything too harsh.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have now been on Phentermine for a week. I have already lost 5 lbs. I need to lose another 20. I am not obese but am on two cholesterol medications. I always weighed the same until my thyroid medication was too low and I gained 20 lbs. I could not get it off no matter what I did...until Phentermine came into my life. I am experiencing none of the side effects except dry mouth. What I am experiencing though  is 1) higher energy; 2) better sleep; 3)a feeling of well being; 4) more focused; 5) less appetite; 6)more stamina. I am only on 15mg per day and feel wonderful.""",3
Trintellix,Depression,"""I just started this medication today and felt the nausea and upset stomach within an hour of taking it. Food felt to heavy for my irritated stomach so I decided to make a protein shake with a scoop of Matcha green tea powder and some Almond milk. After finishing the shake I felt relief from the nausea and my energy went up. It seems like it would work great if it didn&#039;t irritate the stomach. I&#039;m going to give it another few days and if the nausea continues I&#039;m stopping it.""",5
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I&#039;m 19 and have been taking this medicine for insomnia since I was 8 or 9 years old (It&#039;s been so long that I can&#039;t recall exactly when I started). It is the only thing that can put me to sleep as my insomnia is so bad that if I don&#039;t take amitriptyline, I will be up for days. The only issue is that it does make me very groggy in the morning, but that could just be due to the fact that I am a teenager.""",0
Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am 25. I have been taking gabapentin sense I was 17. I must say that I can&#039;t live without it. It makes me feel &quot;my normal&quot;. Anyway, it calms my nerves - but not like a volume ...it makes me feel really good. I feel like I can do and achieve just about anything! I wouldn&#039;t want to be without it. I am prescribed 800 mg gabapentin. I take 1600 mg when I get up in the morning.  Gabapentin changed me..personally..for the better. I love my medicine!""",6
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""OK. This drug isn&#039;t to be underestimated. Its Dangerous. At first I thought it was good because don&#039;t get me wrong it removes depressed emotion - problem is it takes away every other emotion too including good ones. It was hard to stop taking them because it does sort of work and I was scared to withdraw. Then I realised they were effecting my conscience and desicion making skills - they make you not care which made my quality of life worse, making me unable to communicate and also gain weight - then I had to up the dosage. Ironic right? So I decided I&#039;d stop and I did, all of a sudden my sexual pleasure and ability to think straight came back, I&#039;m happy again. Not recommended.""",5
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""Everyone reacts differently to medication. Dosage: 10mg, Sex: Male, Age: 58, Diagnosis: Chronic Insomnia. I&#039;ve take Belsomra 3 nights now with 1 to 2 hours of sleep each night. This is strange stuff, be careful. You feel tired but it does not shut your mind off, I laid in bed for 4 hours awake. At that point after 2 nights of not sleeping I think I would have fallen asleep any way from exhaustion. I did not think I was asleep but started to experiencing the strangest nightmares I have ever had. After another hour of this I did fall into a dream state sleep for sure. The dreams were extremely unusual and lucid ( like when taking Restoril) very strange. I fell in and out of sleep for about 2 hours then woke at 4 am and that was   it.""",0
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I talked to my doctor about Belviq and got a prescription last week. So far I have lost 4 pounds and feel great. It&#039;s like I am suddenly motivated to lose weight. I think as the weight comes off exercising will become easier. I am tolerating the medication without side effects. I noticed no appetite for food and a boost in energy without the nervousness I felt with some of the over the counter products I used to take. I have told my friends and family about Belviq.""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""I have been on this for a week.  Day 1. Blurred vision and feeling like I&#039;m in the matrix zoned out after 2 hours and severe nausea. I wanted to quit. But it calmed me and I felt unbothered by things what would normally make me cry. I take it at night and wake up with SEVERE anxiety as I had before taking it but I can feel my body trying to compress it. I pray and hope it gives me the happy energetic feeling I need. Right now it&#039;s keeping me calm but I still can&#039;t get out of the bed""",5
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I started using clonazepam years ago, recommended by my partners psychiatrist at the time to help me with insomnia. I was using 0.5mg only on occasion and it was a miracle. I would fall asleep within an hour of taking them and have a great nights sleep. Loved it. Years later the dosage is now 4.25mg (as my resistance built up and the lower dosage no longer helped).  I do take them about three times a week to sleep, especially Sunday night before the work week begins.  However, I am now worried that my dosage is too high and I will have trouble getting off of them. """,0
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Four weeks now and it&#039;s amazing, I&#039;m just not hungry at all, not able to eat anything as much as I used to do, for example I used to eat 1x roll with cheese and tomato for breakfast now I can&#039;t finish it and only eat half. Same with other meals, lucky if I can eat a third. I&#039;ve lost 5 kg so far without exercising. Yes it&#039;s expensive but I save on less food! Ok,so the needle is nothing to worry about, it&#039;s tiny and it doesn&#039;t hurt at all, I started injecting in my hip but the absorption is a lot slower so I went on to inject in my tummy and it&#039;s fine, just squeeze a roll of fat and inject :) In the beginning I had problems with constipation and I mean BIG problems but now it&#039;s a lot better but you need to drink a lot of water.""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""Citalopram  works great for me. I&#039;ve been on and off of it for about 5 years. When I was on it several years ago it was like night and day. I have major depression and general anxiety. When going back on it most recently (4 months ago), I started at 20mg for the first month. The first dose helped my anxiety immensely. Within a few weeks my depression lifted some. I&#039;m now on 40mg again and it is definitely helping, but I feel like in the past it worked better for the depression. So Today I&#039;ve started 5mg Abilify  in addition; hoping it will help some more.""",5
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I love this medicine. I have bipolar II disorder, and this medicine does everything it&#039;s supposed to do. It keeps my manic moods completely in check, and works very well in conjunction with Zoloft. I have been on both drugs for years, and I have not had any serious depression or mania for over 20 years! The only side effect that I experience is fatigue, but so worth it. The side effects are minimal. I feel and act NORMAL.""",6
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was prescribed 250 mg, but to take three times a day (every 8 hours).  I don&#039;t think that&#039;s really too high.  Perhaps it&#039;s because I was on such high doses of other things in my past--who knows.  So, to me, my body is used to truly high doses of such medicines.  Either way, 250mg of Depakote DR is the lowest you can be given, and that will only carry you through part of the day.  This is why the doctor has to make you take it three times a day.

I haven&#039;t had practically any side effects, except for a little &quot;wet noodly&quot; feeling, but none of the side effects (yet) that are listed.  Guess it&#039;s different for everyone.""",6
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I ruptured L5/S1 disc at work (I&#039;m 58 years old).  Nothing seemed to  help with the pain until I asked about Gabapentin and started taking 300 mg three times a day along with Ibuprofen 600 mg.   It does help a lot but only when I combine it with Ibuprofen...without I really don&#039;t get relief.  It does take some time for your body to adjust to it - I felt very foggy, and drugged.  I had trouble forming sentences for almost 2 weeks.  It&#039;s a lot better now.""",9
Effexor XR,Depression,"""I was on this medication for about a year and never felt like it ever did anything other than make me irritable and kill my sex drive. It was extremely hard to wean off the 75mg dose which is a comparatively low dose. All up it took me about 6 months to come off it completely and the withdrawal effects after missing a dose would begin within just a few hours (brain zaps, twitchy etc). What I&#039;m amazed about is the fact the doctor who put me on it initially didn&#039;t tell me any of the side effects and didn&#039;t warn me how hard it was to come off. I realise it probably works for some people but as a dispensary tech I see people coming in who are taking 300mg of this stuff a day. I shudder to think how hard it will be for them to stop this drug.""",5
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I started Belviq about 9 days ago. I found a savings card online on the belviq website that will save me approximately $140 each time I fill my prescription. I have experienced a significant mood lift (i can see why it&#039;s a controlled substance), subtle doziness, and better sleep. Sometimes I forget to eat because I just don&#039;t feel hungry. I feel the effects of not having eaten though, I feel tired, sluggish and my stomach hurts a little from being empty, but the terrible &quot;hunger&quot; feeling is completely missing. It&#039;s strange,  but extremely helpful. Overall I have lost 6 lbs in the last 9 days since I started Belviq, and it surely is helping with my appetite. I am very thankful. Belviq does exactly what it&#039;s supposed to.""",2
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I first got the Implanon in March of 08.. wasn&#039;t bad at all. I loved it up until March of this year. For the first two years I had my period at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year. In March of 2010 I began having very heavy periods that lasted a good week or two. Then things really picked up this summer and after talking with my husband I decided to get it taken out and see if things straightened it (only time will tell). Thinking about getting a new one sometime next year. I really loved having it!""",8
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I had 2 different nexplanons in my arm thru a 4 year period. This is why I regret ever getting the nexaplanon. 
1.) It made me have awful acne
2.) the hormonal changes made my hair thin and cause great hair loss.  
3.) it made me a CRAZY BEEOTCH and very irrational.
4.) I would spot all the time
5.) I had scars in my arm from getting the first one removed.
6.) Made me gain a lot of weight.
7.) Made me depressed.
Its not worth it. at least for me.""",8
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""I believe this medication saved my life. I did feel extremely sleepy at first while my dosage was being raised but that went away quickly. I have a new feeling of wanting to get up and do things that wasn&#039;t there before. I also feel a sense of calm and peacefulness. The only side effects so far that were troublesome is constipation and sometimes it&#039;s hard to concentrate if someone is speaking.""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed 5mg ambien after 3 months of not getting more than 2-3 hours of sleep in each 24 hour period. I had tried benadryl, hydroxyzine, and Valium previously, all of which kept me wide awake. I took the 5mg right before bed, as instructed, and laid there awake all night. The next night I decided to try 1 1/2 (7.5 mg) as I keep reading horror stories about 10mg. I took it, waited about 10 minutes, then went to bed. It took me over an hour to fall asleep, but once I did, I&#039;m thrilled to say I slept all night! Unfortunately even after a full night of sleep it was very hard to wake up. I&#039;d wake up then doze back off. That happened several times for about an hour. Once I was able to wake up enough to get up, I was fine""",0
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Doctor suggested Saxenda and this is week 4 @ increased the injection to 2.4. Total loss is 6.5 kilos.  Side effects are extreme tiredness, constipation &amp; heart burn. Due to knee replacement 10 months ago &amp; fractured back I&#039;m limited to exercise so walk every day &amp; night &amp; incl hill climbs. I eat 1000 calories per day &amp; satisfied. However this week I have developed red welts at the injection site. I&#039;ve put ice on it but as yet will not subside &amp; concerned about another injection. I can&#039;t see my doctor till next week so was wondering if anyone else had this experience &amp; why?""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I went to my doctor because I was 128.6 kgs. My knees were starting to give out, I had terrible insomnia, sore spine, I was constantly sick all the time due to a low immune system so because I never exercised, I always developed a swollen throat and developed constant fevers. 

My doctor prescribed me duromine (which is the equivalent of phentermine) and saw the results pretty much immediately. It took me 6 months but I managed to lose 30 kgs just like that. And it keeps falling off. I exercise everyday now, I eat 1400 calories. I&#039;m happier, healthier, I never get sick. People talk to me since I give off a different vibe. I recommend Phentermine to those who are having trouble losing weight.""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have been on this BC a little over 4 months.. the pill made me completely insane. So I switched.. it didn&#039;t have hormones in it and I don&#039;t want kids for a while if really at all,I&#039;m uncertain, FIRST month- great no symptoms nothing. SECOND- was bleeding every so often, hairloss, appetite change, hardly any sex drive, moodiness. And had heavy chest and heart issues (still unknown at the moment) THIRD- bleeding got worse. Would bleed for a week, stop for 1 day or 2, then start again and it&#039;s been like this since, very dark blood but very light but it&#039;s more than spotting. NOW - I&#039;m very irritable, still losing hair, losing weight, no sex drive, can&#039;t sleep much at all, basically losing faith! No sex really bothers me!!""",8
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""I started Loestrin 24 a few months ago and was nervous about some side effects I&#039;ve always heard of from the pill. I was nauseous for only the 1st week, and only got my period for 2 days and had zero cramps even though I used to have to take 3 Advil for the 1st 3 days of my period. No weight gain, only in my breasts (grew a cup size). HOWEVER, this pill made me break out horribly. I&#039;ve always broken out a little before my period, but while on this I got multiple huge cysts on my chin and under my nose before my period and my cheeks which have never broken out before were breaking out as well. Really no side effects but the acne was enough to make me go off of it.""",4
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I have a sleep eating problem and hypothyroidism, so I struggle and have gone from 130 pounds to 172 pounds over the past 7 years but I am 5&#039;2&quot;. That&#039;s a problem plus I recently turned the big 50. I can eat 20 salads or 20 cheese burgers and the scale doesn&#039;t move. I have only taken the pill for 7 days and have lost 3 pounds which is huge. I have zero side effects, no cravings and no night grazing. I think I finally found the help I needed in order to stay motivate to a healthy diet and life style. Couldn&#039;t be more pleasantly surprised and satisfied that this will change my life.""",3
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I was hesitant to get this after reading all the reviews, but I am the world&#039;s worst at trying to remember to take pills, so my husband and I agreed to give this a shot. I got it put in back in June. I had my period for 3 months with maybe 2 days a month where I didn&#039;t bleed. I wanted to rip the thing out, but we agreed to try it for a little longer. In October, my period went to about 2 weeks and when it ended I haven&#039;t had one since and it is now December 7th. I had bad headaches for the first month. I had no weight gain or mood swings. If you can make it through the first couple of months, in my opinion its great. But something you have to remember when reading all these reviews is everyone&#039;s body does not work in the same way.""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Blood sugar has gone through the roof. From normal range (for me, about 100 pre-meal to 140ish 2 hours after a meal) to steadily around 300.  Some weight gain.

Mood is improved quite a bit, so high marks for that.

Sexual side effects are extremely frustrating. Everyone says they will diminish in time, but it&#039;s been 6 months. Not a problem with ED or stamina, but getting to orgasm has proven elusive. 

The blood sugar is the major concern, so if my doctor can help me get that under control I may continue. Otherwise I&#039;ll talk with my psychiatrist about dumping it.""",7
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I have SEVERE chronic insomnia. I alternate between Ambien, Belsomra and Trazodone - so as not to build a tolerance to any one of them. After nearly two years of following this protocol, it turns out that the lesser of these evils is Belsomra. At first it didn&#039;t help, but after a few months it started working pretty well. Ambien causes rebound insomnia. Trazodone causes horrific nightmares. Belsomra is gentle and increasingly effective.

Whatever you do, don&#039;t take Benzodiazepines. It&#039;s easy to become tolerant and then form a physical dependence. Anxiety and insomnia WORSEN. Withdrawal is a living hell. I speak from experience.""",0
Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking Klonopin recently, and I&#039;m mixing it with Vybriid and Lamictal. It helps so much. At night it takes the edge off. I take 0.5mg, sometimes 1mg to help me out more. I haven&#039;t had as bad of racing thoughts while I&#039;m trying to fall asleep and I end up sleeping like a baby. The after effects is a little bit of groggyness but it&#039;s worth it. The only thing that bothers me is that I feel like smoking cigarettes after I take it. Overall, it&#039;s great and stops the mania as well as depression.""",6
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""Today is my 3rd day on medication. I was prescribed it for social anxiety (despite being a beautiful 6&#039;2 male with no reason to be anxious about appearance) generalized anxiety and panic attacks. Talking to people in malls, convenience stores and being around large groups of people frighten me. I havent noticed much of a difference other than lack of sleep, crazy amazing lucid dreams for the first two nights and my jaw clenching. So far no effect on anxiety and took a benzo because Im feeling restless but still feeling restless right now. I pray this works as Im unable to work now due to my anxiety. Ive always had anxiety but after having mono for 2 months it has spiraled completely out of control. I will update this soon. Please work!""",7
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""It works! I&#039;ve been on Contrave three months and I have  lost 27.5 lbs. My beginning weight was 219. The key is to drink plenty of water at least 80 oz a day, eat small healthy meals and please don&#039;t eat high fat foods. If you should over eat expect to pay for it. The food does not stay down and you will feel sick. I take the pills as prescribed by my doctor to reduce any side effects. This is a life change for me and I will not go back to eating heavy meals ever. I do plan to add an exercise program or start  walking  every day to maximize the weight lost.""",3
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Before I started taking clonazepam, my therapist and I worked for 2 years on CBT. It wasn%u2019t working. I was hesitant to take medication for fear that I would be dependent and eventually addicted to medication. After assurance from both my therapist and PCP that Klonopin was not as addictive as other anti anxiety medication. Clonazepam has allowed me to effectively used CBT and other coping mechanisms more effectively, so much so that I am able to use these methods and calm myself down without taking them. If I take one close to my bedtime it helps me fall asleep, however, I take one during the day. I do feel sleepy, but am able to function. I also do not find myself addicted to them. There are times when a 30 day prescription will last for more that 3 months.""",7
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""Have been taking Lunesta, 3mg, for over five years getting 7 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. The last prescription my provider filled was a generic made by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, believe me it is not the same as Lunesta,  I only get about 4 hours of sleep before waking. I recommend that if you have stay away from this brand of generic as it does not have the same effect on your sleep as Lunesta.""",0
Belviq,Obesity,"""Woman of Cuban and Puerto Rican heritage 5&#039;1 and 179 pounds. I wish I could say this was genetic but I just always seemed to be famished and liked my sweets. I have seven months experience and am 43 pounds lighter. I started with diet but once the pound came off I got excited and started biking after the first month to speed things up. Side effects few headache and I was tired initially. Now I sleep easily and don&#039;t get tempted by pretty much anything.""",2
Wellbutrin,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been annoyed all the time since I can remember. Always a pessimist. I figured if I expected the worst possible scenario anything better was a win.
It was as if I was at war with the world, everything was a battle. Been on Welbutrin for 6 weeks now, 300mg a day in 2 doses to start.
Gave me ridiculously bad headaches (I suffer from migraines already) but my mood, interest, and general sense of well being were better. Doc changed me from 2 doses to 3 doses a day (still 300 mg). No more headaches but slight insomnia so far. 3-4 hours a night now, usually get 6-7 hours of sleep.
And I have the dry mouth as well. I will deal with the insomnia and cotton mouth. To me this is worth it.""",6
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda in November 2016, the week before Thanksgiving. It is January 31, 2017. I am 5&#039; 1&quot; and when I started Saxenda I weighed 205 lbs. I now weigh 178 lbs. I have been able to come off of my blood pressure meds and I no longer need my CPAP when I sleep at night. I have less joint pain and I no longer get winded walking up a flight of stairs.The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced are nausea with each titration up of the medication, mild headache the first few weeks, nasty sulphur burps, and diarrhea. I haven&#039;t had any constipation. None of the side effects were severe enough to make me consider stopping the medication.""",2
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""Had a problem with anxiety after a major surgical complication. Doctor 1st tried a SSRI (Escitalopram). Wow, HUGE increase in anxiety and a full on panic attack. No previous psych history before this. Had to stop after 3 doses. Once I settled down tried some mirtazapine at low dose (7.5 mg). Now we&#039;re talking! Almost immediate relief of anxiety and no side effects at all!

Here&#039;s a tip. Mirtazapine can be very sedating in some due to its anti-histamine effect. 1st try 50 mg of Benadryl in the daytime on a day you can afford to crash if needed. If the Benadryl zonks you avoid mirtazapine; if you aren&#039;t too sedated it is worth a try.""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m 14 years old, and my dermatologist prescribed Doryx for me for 2 months and all it did was create worse acne. I have no idea why it didn&#039;t work, but I was put on Sulfamethoxazole about a week ago, and I already see a difference. My dermatologist said this drug is almost the same as Doryx, but has a different molecule in it. If you are going to try Doryx, I would definitely take it with food. With Doryx I threw up 4 times because I didn&#039;t take it with enough food.""",4
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I had been on generic Lexapro 10mg for about 18 months and it treated my depression well, but I gained almost 40 pounds, was a bit sleepy, and was experiencing sexual side effects.  I was scared to try something else but the weight gain was just too much, especially since it seemed to continue.  My doctor gave me Trintellix 10mg samples which I&#039;ve taken for a month and what a difference!  I no longer feel sleepy all of the time and the difficulty in achieving orgasm is gone.  As for the weight issue, i&#039;ll have to see if it helps.  I feel much more &quot;normal&quot; than on Lexapro as far as energy and mental focus.  The only downside is I do feel more anxious and have more nervous energy, so I don&#039;t know how well this drug would treat anxiety.""",5
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I am taking 54mg for inattentive ADD its only been a month of taking Concerta without breaks, but I feel I have the general feeling down. I can focus with minimal distraction. After 3 weeks I am feeling the loss of appetite, lost 6lbs in one week and there is only a period of about 5 hours I can feel it work, during that time I love the motivation I get and am more social. All in all it does what it&#039;s supposed to but for only around 5-6 hours, after the working period I am easily aggravated and my ADD is worse than ever. My anxiety was high at first but after a month I feel like it is less of a problem for me. """,1
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I have severe insomnia. I wanted to try a new drug because my Dr. suggested it. No way will I take another 10 mg tablet. It took 2 hours to take effect. I started feeling sleepy so I crawled into bed. Within 30 min of laying down, my body was unable to move but my mind was racing. I tried to tell my husband what was happening and I couldn&#039;t get the words out. It lasted about 10 hours. I had a hard time getting up. I have been confused and foggy all day. I will never do it again.""",0
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I have been on this medication for one month and my cystic acne is completely gone as a result, but it didn&#039;t clear up completely until week 3. I give this a 10 for the results. However, there is a long list of bad side effects for this medication and I suffered many of them. I had severe stomach pains. The pain wouldn&#039;t last long but it came on quick and strong before stopping. I also had some digestive issues, and an upset, gurgling stomach non-stop for the first week or two. I also got bad headaches and had no appetite for two weeks. It also made me nauseated at first. After week two, the side effects stopped, but it was a rough start.""",4
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""the alternative, which was 5 months of back to back Plan B, followed by a surgical abortion, which was followed by yet another dose of Plan B.

This is my first experience with birth control other than condoms. It&#039;s only been 2 months for me, but since getting paragard my sex drive is super high and I&#039;m really glad I did it. I spotted for 2 weeks after insertion. Then 2-3 weeks later, my period came. My first period was long- 2 to 3 extremely mind bogglingly heavy days, 3 normal days, and 5 extremely light days (spotting). No cramps though.

My insurance covered the entire cost. My only concern is I&#039;ll end up being part of the 0.8% that gets pregnant.""",8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I was on Clavaris for 5 months for my moderate acne that only got worse with age (I am 26). It worked wonders. I have been off the medicines for 3 months- not one pimple and even the old scars cleared up. One downside though was that I started getting depressed and anxious especially during the last month so I stopped taking it. The depression went away but I have trouble with speaking in public forums and in interviews now. I know, kind of ironic to have less self esteem now even with the perfect skin. Just watch out for those signs, they could be dangerous if not controlled or even acknowledged. Overall I am still happy I took the medicine.""",4
Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Loved Tegretol, kept my moods stable, worked well, felt calm and happy and in control for the first time in years,
Until a Dr decided it was ok to mix this with antibiotics along with the pill, and sinus medication, I suffered from TENS, after being told 3 times it couldn&#039;t be that I was so suck ended up in hospital for 2 months.
Now I remain untreated due to fear, however, what works or some doesn&#039;t work for others.
This worked for me until my body decided I was allergic to it and everything else.
Please be mindful of what you take any medication with!""",6
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I have been on Spironolactone 50 mg a day now since August 2016. After being blessed with clear skin the majority of my adult years, I suddenly was stricken with deep, painful acne, all over my  checks, mouth and forehead. I originally tried doxy for three months with little to no success. Transitioning to Spiro was the best thing I ever did. Warning: It WILL get worse before it gets better!!! My skin was the worst it ever was the first two weeks starting it. But it slowly started clearing (noticable results within 2 months), and now after 6 months my skin is the best it&#039;s been in years! I take this in conjunction with clindamyacin (which I&#039;ve been on for 10 years). Stick with it!!! It WILL get better!""",4
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I was prescribed Topmax for migraines but I have had weight loss being on it. I take 50mg twice a day. I had the same problem with the pop it tasted flat (Still have). I had (have) the tingling in certain body parts and the tired feeling at first. I started taking them July 2015 and by January 2016 I have lost 40lbs. I was 190 and am now 147 and going down every day! The only thing that I have changed is I drink water. I eat whatever I want some days I eat more some days less. I used to go through a 12 pack of Mt Dew a day. It was hard at first but I honestly don&#039;t mind now. Because when I look in that mirror every morning its worth drinking that bottle of water.""",2
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I think Klonopin is the bottom-of-the-barrel of benzodiazepine anti-anxiety/anti-panic medicines. This is from personal experience with it &amp; other benzodiazepines. Klonopin, for one thing, lacks the muscle-relaxant effect that&#039;s an additonal benefit of other benzodizepines such as Valium (diazepam). But what&#039;s worse is that Klonopin caused me to lose 2 jobs. It has this strange effect of prompting me to &#039;speak my mind&#039; -- a little too much! Not the case with Valium, which has a much more pleasant effect. With further research I found out that Klonopin was intially marketed for seizure disorders *only*. But, because it didn&#039;t sell well for that, the company basically pushed into the anti-anxiety market. There&#039;s much better out there.""",7
Intuniv,ADHD,"""This is a great medicine. I have known that my daughter now 7, has always been extremely energetic and talkative her entire life, but her impulsivity, inability to concentrate on work (or play), and energy were really interfering with her school and home life. I was so stressed out every day. The behavioral problems were never ending. I mean this child was ALWAYS in trouble, poor girl! She is now like the little girl that I always knew was hiding away in there, but would only rarely come out, she has all of the same positive personality traits plus more. I feel like I can finally connect with her, like her brain just clicked and she is now living in the same reality as everyone around her instead of lost in her  mind. It does make her sleepy.""",1
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My son has been taking Ritalin for around 6-8 months and the difference in him is just unbelievable, he&#039;s school work has improved, he&#039;s spelling and comprehension has gotten a lot better and he has excelled in maths and can actually remembers what he has learnt. He socially gets along better with other children and is less destructive when in a group setting. I was very hesitant to put my son on meds but now realise I made the best choice for him.""",1
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Through testing, I was determined to have Adult Attention Deficit Disorder (AADD). I had gotten to the point where I could not read, and reading has been the love of my life since age 6. I&#039;m 70 now. I found it hard to get anything done, hard to remember what I was doing. It&#039;s hard to say how much of this was caused by five year abusive relationship, finally ended in Jan 2015. I am now reading like I used to: novels, studies for school, keeping on on world affairs, etc. What a gift! My psychiatrist wants me to continue Ritalin. Past history shows I snowballed into depression without it. I do take her advice, but it makes me so hyper! I have to take xanax to calm down. Taking one drug that requires taking another is not a good thing in my book, but what can I do?""",1
Vilazodone,Anxiety,"""I get panic attacks at least once per day, and my doctor didn&#039;t want me taking Xanax on a daily basis. I&#039;ve tried a few other medicines in the past, but can&#039;t handle the sexual side effects- supposedly this medicine has less of them. 

My experience:
10mg per day I had zero side effects, but after a month also zero noticeable help. My doctor told me to up it to 20mg. At 20mg, I was so sick to my stomach I had to call in sick to work. Tried it one more time with the same results. So I compromised and took 15mg per day. Still little to no noticeable help- and I was always mildly nauseous (always took with a full meal). As far as sexual side effects- I never got aroused on my own, but I could orgasm, which was better than others.""",7
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve tried lunesta, ambien, and trazodone for insomnia. None of these worked very well for me. Thank god I found Belsoma. I received a trial pack and experimented with different doses. The 5 mg and 10 mg seemed worthless and had no noticeable effect. I decided to go with the 20 mg and wow, what a difference! 

It usually takes me over 1 hour to fall asleep, but with the 20 mg belsoma, I&#039;ve been consistently falling asleep within 20 minutes!!

I understand this medicine has not performed well for a majority of other people, however, my body chemistry has responded very positively to it.

So my opinion is if other insomnia medications have not worked for you, give this one a try and make sure you go with the 20 mg.""",0
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I have Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). It&#039;s a painful condition that keeps me up all night long. I take narcotics (least possible) &amp; other CNS depressants. I have tried everything 4 insomnia &amp; ambien was my fail proof last ditch for 7 years. But ambien stopped working. I was taking 20mg a night. For the 1st time I took Belsomra last night - 10mg (supposedly ineffective dose) &amp; I slept better than I have in years. Lunesta sucks. I&#039;m really not ok w/taking anti-psychotics/seizures or benzos for sleep as they can affect  your mind later. What&#039;s the point of sleep if you don&#039;t heal? Benzos change REM sleep anyway and your memory fails in 10 y. I slept last night. I&#039;m grateful for the med. $10 a pill is expensive but worth it. I will keep trying them. Downloaded coupons.""",0
Prozac,Depression,"""I started this in the hospital at 20 after a few days they upped it to 40. I felt weird the first week or so then somewhat normal
 I didn&#039;t have an appetite for the first couple of weeks
 The major side effect has been insomnia.  I woke up at 2 or 3 in the morning.  I don&#039;t fall alseep because I have to get up at 6 and my spouse will get up at 445 am
I&#039;ve taking my son to school and then coming home and sleeping. I tired tea, melatonin and some liquid sleep aid but morning has worked to help sleep through the night
I dont want to take another medication""",5
Doxycycline,Acne,"""This medication is a miracle. I suffered with cystic acne and had breakouts all over my cheeks and jawline. Just after three days of taking the medication, my face was less red. After two weeks, I had no acne. I&#039;ve been taking the medication for three weeks now and I&#039;m so satisfied with the results. I still breakout, but I only get 2-3 pimples now and then. I had no side effects when taking this medication, and for me, it did not make my acne worse before it got better. I recommend this medication for anyone who is suffering from acne!""",4
Concerta,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been taking Concerta for over 5 years now. At first it helped me focus and get my mind together. It also kick started a great social life and got me A&#039;s through High School. After the first year though I took a downturn. I became almost emotion less and robotic like, that eventful social life degraded, and I felt like a complete loser. It&#039;s a terrible feeling. After 3 years of use I worked to get my social life back and slowly found it once again. Even though I was lacking feelings I learned how I could access my emotions through certain mental triggers. Now five years later my social life is siralling once again and I&#039;m still getting A&#039;s, but instead of feeling robotic like I now get intense rushes and euphorias followed by depression.""",1
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I was on this for a little over a year, as a birth control it worked, however I would get 2-3 week long periods that were awful! Or I would be on my period for about a week it would stop 4 days then start again. My acne didn&#039;t get any worse but I did randomly get depressed, especially for about the first 3 months mood swings like crazy. I&#039;m sure it works great for some people I was just not on of them.""",8
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I have been taking phendimetrazine 105 capsule for about 3 weeks. I am on a 3 month cycle and I am not going to weigh myself until the 3 months are up. I am 6&#039;1&quot; and 298lbs. I put on 98 pounds in 18 months due to various stress related issues in my life ranging from a new house to a new baby and the death of my father. So now I am on the road to recovery and need to get back into shape. People are telling me I look like I lost weight and I can tell that my pants are fitting a little loser and my shirts aren&#039;t as tight, so I guess its working. I don&#039;t have any real side effects I already suffer from anxiety and the pill does not really get me anxious so that&#039;s a plus. I am going to continue with the medication and hopefully lose 100lbs.""",2
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am a nurse. I was already on wellbutrin SR-150mg 2x daily.  I concur with the dieter below. Have your Dr prescribe these meds separately.  No side effects.  The dose of naltrexone is way too high in contrave  (just my personal. .not professional opinion!) 4-5 mg of naltrexone 1-2 times a day is plenty.  Naltrexone will only work if you truly have a binge type actual food addiction.  It works on the reward center of our brains just like that of drug addicts and alcoholics. The grandiose feeling we get when we eat and all is suddenly right with the world. It turns that off for us. (And..prescribing this way? Super cheap! :)""",2
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I started taking this medication to replace Xanax in the early 90&#039;s.  I am now 44 and have been on .5mg-2mg/day of this drug for almost 25 years.  I also take sertraline (Zoloft) and buspirone (Buspar) for my depression, anxiety, panic, and OCD- all of which I&#039;ve suffered with since childhood.  The Clonazepam has been a wonderful drug which has allowed me time free from the agony of anxiety.  It has also caused me problems with drowsiness and memory.  Withdrawal has been manageable on a couple of occasions.  I am currently on .25mg/day/prn and am trying to get off of it completely per my MD.  The couple of time I came off of it precipitously to avoid drug screenings at work were some of the worst times of my life.""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started this Medication on October 6th 2015.  So far I have gained 2 pounds. The first week I took the one pill and everyday I was sleepy around 3pm at work. I am now taking 1am and 1pm, I have diarrhea but that&#039;s about it. My eating habits has always been irregular I do notice I don&#039;t snack in between meals. I just received my scale, I am still excited so I will check in to give an update.""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""So I started saxenda March 5th 2017 and it hasn&#039;t been a week yet but let me tell you these side effects are AWFUL. I&#039;ve woke up twice now vomiting,  I have to eat every bite incredibly slow to make sure I don&#039;t get sick from that bite, nausea, vomiting, sweating. I will definitely give this a go anyway and take my nurses word for it that the side effects will pass. I haven&#039;t been able to take my weight yet so I&#039;m not sure how much I&#039;ve lost. Good luck people it&#039;s pretty rough in the beginning. By the way I&#039;m taking this because I am an autoimmune disease patient and had my thyroid removed""",2
Benzaclin,Acne,"""I had mild acne until I went on Benzaclin. Usually 4-5 pimples at any time. After using Benzaclin for a week, I can say my acne has completely cleared up! I apply a thin layer all over my face. It is very tempting to apply more to troublesome areas but additional product will only cause dryness. I still have red marks from where the pimples were but am sure that within a month or so they too will be gone!""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been trying lose weight since I had my son two years ago. I worked out with no results. I have been taking Adipex for two and a half weeks and I have lost 13 lbs. I had a big burst of energy the first day I took Adipex, but could not sleep that night.  The next day I did not have any side effects or burst of energy. The only problem I still have is the dry mouth.  This has been a miracle drug.""",3
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Qsymia in the end of November.  It&#039;s now nearing the end of May and I&#039;ve lost just shy of 40 lbs.  I&#039;ve been watching my diet and also incorporating moderate amounts of exercise.  I have hypothyroidism and was unable to lose weight using any other method alone.  This medication has been a life saver!  I no longer have to take blood pressure meds and will likely be stepping down the dosage of my thyroid meds soon due to lower body weight.  I still want to lose another 30-40 lbs. to be at a healthy weight.  My rate of weight loss has been steady...not too slow but not too rapid, either.  I can&#039;t say enough about it.""",3
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My 6 year old son has Aspergers and ADHD. He takes Strattera and 3mg of Intuniv daily for about 3 months now.  While it seems as if I can actually get his attention now while before I could not hardly at all, he is still having trouble paying attention and completing work in school. He is getting in less trouble, fewer outbursts and staying in his seat. Though I feel I should credit that to the Strattera which he started just a month before the Intuniv. He can hold conversation now too. The big issue has been headaches and stomach pain, including vomiting and heartburn. He would say his stomach and chest burns and is hot. Well recently an ulcer was found. """,1
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had insomnia for years. Finally had a sleep study done and it turned out I have moderate sleep apnea along with restless legs syndrome.

Was prescribed a CPAP and Trazodone. Currently taking 300mg per night. It puts me to sleep fast but I always wake up after 3 - 3.5 hours of sleep. 

After reading others comments I&#039;m considering trying 450mg to see if that will keep me asleep.

My wife can sleep 12 hours easily. Wish I could experience sleep like hers!""",0
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have taken lamotrigine for about 5 weeks.  I tapered from nefazodone to lamotrigine over the course of 3 weeks.  I am currently at 100 mg of lamotrigine.  I was feeling better than I have ever felt in my entire life for about 2 weeks, now I am back to where I was before.  No, I was not feeling manic during those 2 weeks but I felt that my anxiety had been greatly reduced and I had a true appreciation for life.  I feel a bit cheated that I got to feel normal for once in my life and then poof it is gone.  I kind of knew that it  was too good to be true or to last.  Oh well""",6
Nefazodone,Depression,"""My PCP prescribed Serzone for me after I described typical symptoms of depression. As an RN I didn&#039;t want to feel &quot;medicated&quot; &amp; never did. This medicine gave me back  myself. I was on it for about 4 yrs then switched to Paxil for about 2 yrs and then taken off all together. I haven&#039;t been on any medicines for depression in 7 yrs as my divorce is long over &amp; I am well healed - Amen! I would recommend Serzone   regular lab work &amp; doctor&#039;s care. Also, talk therapy helps too!""",5
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I had a terrible experience with this bc. Once I started taking it, I was very nauseous daily for a week. Once I got my period, it was so painful and so heavy, I couldn&#039;t even do anything. I would also get a full blown period twice in one month. My period was never like that before. I stayed on it for 3 months or so trying to let my body get used to it but it was not working out. I started taking this birth control to shrink ovarian cysts. I had two small ones that did go away but I had another bigger one pop up. But Everybody is different. I just felt like sharing my experience. I am now taking minastrin 24 fe. So we will see how this works for me....""",8
Morphine,Pain,"""I have muscle atrophy and have been taking MS Contin for about a year now. I started taking 15mg in the morning and 15mg in the afternoon. That stopped working. So we went to 30mg in the morning and 15mg in the afternoon. That stopped working so now I just started taking 30mg twice a day and so far it&#039;s working. I have a lot of pain but we will see how long this dose works for. I think it has a lot of side effects as well. But I couldn&#039;t live without it.""",9
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I am about two weeks into taking escitalopram.  The first two days were side effect free. But after that I was vomiting constantly and could barely eat anything. I have lost five pounds and I am already a small girl. I experience very mild headaches here and there. Mostly at night when I am trying to sleep. One minute I am constipated and the next I have diarrhea. Not cool. I cannot eat much at all, have NOT lost any sexual interest. Now that I am two weeks into the medication I am experiencing additional anxiety like heart palpitations and feelings of wanting to break down crying over nothing.  I used to be on a higher dose of &lsquo;citalopram&rsquo; which caused no side effects but this one is hard on my body. Hope it works for my anxiety eventually""",7
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I haven&#039;t been able to fall asleep until after 2 or 3am for about a year, even if I was extremely tired I would just lie in bed for hours. I would be lucky if I got 3-5 hours of sleep a night. My doctor prescribed me Ambien 2 weeks ago. I&#039;ve been getting the best sleep ever. I even wake up after 6-8 hours fully refreshed and awake. I&#039;m just happy to be getting a normal sleep. This really works. I have no stories of waking up in the middle of the night doing odd things.""",0
Copper,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had my Paragard in for 8 months so far. Same as everyone else, pretty crampy when getting it inserted. However love the fact that it works. The only downfall is I bleed WAY more. I bleed through super+ tampons in less than 8 hours. I&#039;m going to a doctor to see if I need to change the device. Also, my mood swings are pretty crazy lately. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the excessive bleeding or what. I want to love the paragard, but if you have known problems with low iron or thin blood it may not be right for you!""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on this med just over 3 weeks. I initially was put off by the side effects (feeling a bit off, nausea, body aches) so started at one tab every other day. That seemed to make the transition better. But still not without side effects. The worst of which are: dry mouth (which helps up water intake so not too bad), hot flashes (which are NOT fun but manageable ), and constipation (the worst of them all and nothing I do seems to help).   
But to date I have just hit my 10 lb lost mark!  Within the first few days I could walk by cakes or donuts that were brought in to work and it was like it didn&#039;t even register as &quot;food&quot; in my mind.  Cravings for soda and junk are gone and I can eat very little to feel full.""",2
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""Since I started taking 15mg of Adderall XR about 2 weeks ago I feel like it&#039;s changing my life for the better. I can&#039;t say it is having a huge impact on me but I can definitely notice a difference when I&#039;m on it as opposed to when I&#039;m not. My concentration has definitely improved. I can stay on the same thought pattern a lot easier and also follow through with the task at hand. I feel more aggressive towards events that happen it definitely gives me a different outlook.The only symptoms that I am getting with Adderall XR is a loss of appetite. It&#039;s really strange how I went from having a huge appetite to just not even thinking about eating or making it a priority. I don&#039;t like it but it saves me a bit of money.""",1
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking Saxenda since March 1, 2016.  In the last 5 months and 1 week, I have lost 48 lbs.  I started out at 268 lbs and am now at 220 lbs.  This medication has been life changing for me.  The only side effect I experience is constipation.  I try to combat this by drinking lots of water and taking Senokot at bedtime.  If anyone has better suggestions for this, I&#039;d love to hear as this is my greatest struggle at the moment. I give myself the injection at night before bed.  My goal is to lose another 40 lbs before I re-evaluate where I am with the medication.  My appetite has drastically lowered, so I find I really need to ensure I&#039;m making smart choices when eating, like adding healthy fats to give me more calories.""",3
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""My Anxiety symptoms before Lexapro
I was always paranoid of people judging me and just wasn&#039;t myself because I always felt panicked.  I would socially isolate myself from friends and family, which then drove me into depression.  My anxiety inhibited myself from learning and grasping new knowledge because I was too anxious to even learn.  Even doing the smallest tasks (paying bills) would cause an overwhelming amount of anxiety.

Now (after 4 weeks on 10 mg)
- I&#039;m mellow, feel confident. Someone I just met pegged me as an intellect! God knows how long anxiety has made me doubt my intelligence.  I&#039;m able to do tasks easier, which has reduced my procrastination.  It hasn&#039;t completely reduced my depression, but Im thinking of trying 20 mg.""",7
Paroxetine,Depression,"""It was pretty efficient.

WORST experience in the world it&#039;s very physically debilitating: nausea/ dizziniess/ wierd feeling ON my head
had to take xanax to combat the withdrawal symptoms, couldnt leave the house for 2 mnoths!""",5
Clonidine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve found clonidine to be unparalleled at preventing anxiety of the restless and impatient type. I.e. the kind of anxiety that keeps me from sitting in one place. I take clonidine before any engagement where I must sit for a while, e.g., waiting rooms, court rooms and so on. Places where some patience is in order. Clonidine is the best for this. The only side effect is a very slight dry mouth, and that only happens sometimes.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Phentermine was just what I needed to help me lose the weight I needed to lose. I have high family risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and stroke, so when my blood sugar showed that I was pre-diabetic at 168 lbs. My doctor put me on 1200-1500 calorie diet and phentermine. I&#039;ve always exercised three times a week. I lost 20 lbs. in three months and lost another 10 lbs. in the last year. At first I experienced side effects of dry mouth, trouble sleeping, and constipation by that subsided over time. I am still taking the medication, gong in for monthly weight and blood pressure checks, but lately have been feeling like it is losing its effectiveness. I&#039;m a little concerned about its addictive qualities and plan to ask my doctor about it.""",3
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on Belviq for about a month now.  I can&#039;t take anything with a stimulant in it, so Belviq was really the only option for me.  

I lost 5 pounds in first week and then nothing the next.  Was starting to get discouraged and then it started to work.  I have fewer cravings and do feel full sooner.  I&#039;ve lost about 13 pounds and can see the difference in my legs and abdomen.  

Primary side effects for me (some of which might have been caused by increase in Metformin at same time) were slight headache in first week (went away), mild diarrhea in first week (also went away), dry mouth/eyes (already had an issue but got worse) and very tired in evenings (falling asleep at 9:30 instead of 11:30) and in mornings (but ok during day).""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""* EDIT last entry didn&#039;t include score

I&#039;ve been on Lomaira for about 8 weeks and have had success. My doctor first put me on 37.5 mg generic phentermine, but I couldn&#039;t stop sweating and it was giving me anxiety. I was definitely eating less, but I hated the feeling. My doctor told me a new weight loss medication was now available that was more targeted to evening when I tend to over eat after work. It&#039;s definitely a bit more expensive. I&#039;m paying $29/month and the generic was about $18/month. I prefer the brand and I like starting on this low dose. You can go all the way up to 24mg with this so I will probably stay on lomaira for a while. I&#039;ve lost about 18 lbs in 2 months. I don&#039;t like drugs so I&#039;m happy to use less phentermine""",2
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My son started Vyvanse two weeks ago and the difference is incredible. He has never had behavioral issues and only suffers from ADD. He just couldn&#039;t concentrate or stay on task. Reading was a nightmare and he was barely managing to pass. We were scared of trying any medicines but are so glad that we did. He did experience a few side effects such as headaches and nausea the first few days, but those have passed. Most important, he is still my son, no zombies. Homework is easy and his teacher already reports better grades. I encourage any parent to at least try this medicine. It has improved our quality of life even. We have more time for fun stuff and I don&#039;t have to nag him constantly to do his normal chores. They get done the first time.""",1
Belviq,Obesity,"""I just picked up Belviq over the weekend and I can say that I noticed a big change in my appetite. It&#039;s as if I have no energy to eat more than I have to and my stomach feels more full sooner into the meal so I eat less. Now I have tried many diets, many weight loss supplements without success so I was skeptical. Belviq is different. Instead of messing with your metabolism, it focuses on the appetite center and nothing more. I have had no side effects! Unlike the others I have tried in the past such as anxiety, nervousness, headaches, palpitations. I&#039;m motivated to finally lose that 30 lbs my doctor keeps yelling at me about!""",2
Adderall,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia over two years ago, have been struggling with it for about 7. Recently went to a psychiatrist because my pain doctor and pcp suggested it because of me complaining about concentration and fatigue issues. I have only been on this a short time but so far it&#039;s been A LIFE SAVER. I was started on a low dose of course just 10mg once a day IR. I could easily take 3 of these a day. My pain doctor recently put me on the lowest dose of a butrans patch and it&#039;s made a huge difference but my energy was still gone and I still struggled (I only worked on average 20 hours a week because doing much more has been too hard and I have an easy job in an office ).

Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I wanted to add another good review to the sea of bad ones. This was my first form of birth control other than condoms so I had no idea how I would react and was absolutely terrified! I decided to try it anyway since it can be removed anytime and my insurance paid for it in full. 
Granted its only been one week, but if I couldn&#039;t feel it (which is reassuring to know its there and intact) I would forget I was on birth control! I&#039;ve had absolutely no side effects. If anything changes I&#039;ll edit this review.""",8

Any ideas what I can do??""",9
Strattera,ADHD,"""At first I hated it because it didn&#039;t give me the energy of Vyvanse and I desperately wanted my Dr. to switch me back. After a couple of weeks I realized that even though I was a little tired and not really focused I was calm and happy. This medication doesn&#039;t really do much for my ADD but it eases my anxiety that I always have had. I&#039;ve tried many other medications and nothing worked for anxiety except for this one. It feels great to be calm and not worried about nonsense. Hope it keeps working for a long time to come.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am on week four and have zero side effects. The first three days I was a bit jittery, but that&#039;s it.

Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Started on by vyvanse after I was diagnosed with ADD at an age of 19. I had been on Strattera to previously which worked well, but I was still a bit lathargic. The first few months were great, but as the doses started increasing I became delusional &amp; physcotic. It go so bad at 40mg that I thought the mafia was coming to get me, but in reality it was just a car driving in front of my house. This drug ended up with me being sedated by the cops, and being placed in the psychiatric ward for a month. The withdrawals I got from this drug were horrible, I imagine it&#039;s what it&#039;s like to quit a harder recreational drug. I know this drug works great for some people, but not for everyone.

Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""In response to Natalie- why didn&#039;t your doctor wean you off this medication?

My daughter just started taking this for panic disorder brought about by MIf the RX only comes in capsule form at those two doses- then there needs to be advocacy to change this so there is a way to wean off this med! So many people report negative side effects- withdrawal shouldn&#039;t be torture and you might need to find a more compassionate doctor- it astonishes me the lack of empathy some professionals have- considering their career choice- if they can&#039;t be compassionate, they should stay AWAY from patients and stick to reearch!""",7

I wasnt hungry at all, most days I wouldn&#039;t feel like eating untill lunchtime, then I would take a pill with a bottle of water before lunch then eat a small lunch, and an even smaller dinner.  I would try to walk for 20-30 minutes a day, sometimes more, sometimes I wouldn&#039;t get a chance to walk at all. The doctor was very pleased, as was I.

So far, I feel great today. A little bit revved up, but not too bad.  Absolutely no hunger at all. Very thirsty - but that&#039;s a good reason to slam water instead of soda. I&#039;m giving up all sugary foods and drinks.  I want to get back to my comfortable weight of 130-140, and then see where it goes from there. FINGERS CROSSED! I will update more in a couple days.

Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I took this and it&#039;s the best thing I have ever tried. The first couple of days I went by the directions then I doubled the dose. And I lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks.  It did make me feel very jittery and my heart rate was going 90 to nothing but I was determined to lose weight.! And a little information DO NOT I repeat ( DO NOT ) take Fastin before you get in a tanning bed. Tan first then take it. It made me very very strange in a bad way.  I&#039;m no doctor but when I increased my dose I had the shaking and the increased heart rate. But It never harmed me.""",3
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I take 100mg as a PRN for extreme anxiety/panic attacks. It works almost as well as Ativan but without the unfortunate inevitability of building up a tolerance that happens with taking benzos.The only downside is that my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it while it does cover Ativan, otherwise I would just switch over completely.

The sensation is a bit different than using benzos to stop a panic attack. Where Ativan will work very quickly in 20-30 minutes tops and smother and separate you from the sensation of panic in your chest, with hydroxyzine it takes about 45 minutes and the way the anxiety slowly petering-out sort of creeps up on you. You have to be more patient which can be awful when you&#039;re panicking but the end result is nearly identical.""",7
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got nexplanon after my surprise son and had no periods for a year however I had no sex drive, it was painful even, and cramping but no period. Then the flood gates let loose and I started having 2 week periods with hormone fluxes, hot flashes, weight gain and acne. So after a few months I got it removed and got a non hormonal IUD and I bleed for 3 weeks. Then had a week off. Then had ANOTHER period. Still having issues and I don&#039;t see them going away any time soon. Super unhappy with this product.""",8
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""At one point, I was on regular seroquel as needed and seroquel XR daily. During this time, I gained a lot of weight that I just could not take off. I was prescribed the seroquel as needed, 25 mgs up to 3 times a day. 
Later on, I was going through something else and seroquel had just gone generic. My psychiatrist put me back on the 25 mg pill as needed. I rarely used it and this time I didn&#039;t gain any weight from it, which I was relieved about. I know they say that the lower doses are supposed to make you really tired, but that didn&#039;t seem to have any effect on me.""",6
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medicine has been amazingly helpful. After being misdiagnosed with depression I began taking this once my bipolar symptoms were diagnosed correctly. For those of you who may not think the drug works, I wonder if your doctor is doing a blood test to determine if your dosage meets the therapeutic level. Also, I learned the hard way that birth control pills totally negate the effect of Lamictal. It took a while to straighten that one out. Thanks to all for writing in.""",6
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Please, please, please do your research before ever taking Klonopin or any drug in the benzodiazepine family.  Klonopin has caused me great hardship and nearly cost me my life.  And I am not alone - thousands of people have had horrific experiences with this drug.  Please search &quot;benzo withdrawal&quot; or similar to educate yourself.  Looking back, my original anxiety was nothing compared to the torture I went through once I was addicted to klonopin.  And I am not through it yet.  Words  can not explain the horror I went through.  That is why I beg you to do your own research.  Most doctors don&#039;t know or are in denial about the withdrawal effects of benzodiazepines.  The stories you will find are not lies or exaggerations. Buyer beware! Please!!""",7
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""From (way) past experiences, lorazepam works better than diazepam (Valium) or alprazolam (Xanax) when comparing correctly converted dosages, administered for the same purposes of anxiolysis for clinically significant anxiety related to adjustment disorders, and potentization of concurrently administered fentanyl or other narcotic for outpatient procedures, whether of a  surgical nature, or diagnostic and imaging procedures for an individual who may have difficulty remaining still for extended periods of time, as in an MRI.  While midazolam (Versed) is the traditional benzo- favorite to be combined with fentanyl via IV, especially for the better retro- and anteriograde amnesia it usually provides, midazolam is difficult to obtain by pill.""",7
Pristiq,Depression,"""I couldn&#039;t be happier with Pristiq as it has helped me get back in the game of life again. I started taking Pristiq six weeks ago, following its recommendations and those who have had success on it. While on daily Pristiq, I also do 30 minutes of exercise (rebounding, walking, swimming), drink 2 litres of water, only 1 cup of  coffee/ tea a day and no alcohol. Regular bedtime/risetime (8 hours min sleep). Quick results help me to persevere for 3 weeks to form new habits and get control of my life again.  The rebounding offset my dizziness, nausea, sluggishness, constipation and &quot;I-don&#039;t-feel-like-it&quot;s.  Pristiq and a healthier lifestyle have me feeling like my old self again, enjoying life, friendships, good health and work again.""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I rushed into getting an IUD. Didn&#039;t do enough research. I spoke to a few people who have IUDs and they love them. Well, I hate mine. It was the worst pain I&#039;ve ever felt when I got it inserted. I&#039;ve had it for about a month now and I haven&#039;t stopped spotting or bleeding since I got it. I have random cramps and back pains. I feel bloated and I have major mood swings. I have my monthly follow up appointment tomorrow and I&#039;m thinking about having it removed, depending on what my doctor says.""",8
Vilazodone,Depression,"""I have had depression for years with obsessive compulsive disorder. I have been been on everything from Xanax, Effexor, Depakote, Prozac, Zoloft, etc. I started Viibryd 4 days ago along with ADHD medicines and anxiety meds and I have to say my brain is not running 90 to nothing I am not depressed and feel good. Yes my GI system has been upset and last two nights I have not slept well and I have had a mild headache but because everything is manageable and I mental feel better I am willing to tough it out and hopefully it will stop. Doctor gave me a free starter kit starting with 10mgs for 7 days then 20mgs for 7 days and 40mgs for 7 days so hopefully it will keep going this good or better.""",5
Fentanyl,Pain,"""My son took every pain pill there is for his chronic pain. Then a doctor tried the 25 size patch on him. It was not enough. We went to the 50 size and it did the job. He was a world of better on the patches. He felt better all the time and was not getting constipated as he did on the pills. He never feels euphoric on the patch. The only complaint was that the patches wear off after the second day.
 I called Mylan Laboratories and discussed the patches with the Information person. She said that a lot of patients absorb the medicine quicker than others and those patients change the patch every other day. We are now using a 25 size and changing it every other day.""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My 7 year old son has shown ADHD symptoms for about 2 years or so but due to many changes in his life, I was unsure of the reason for this behavior. Now we&#039;ve been settled in for &gt;9 months and he has not improved, we have decided to medicate (after dietary changes and omega 3 gave no help). He has been taking Ritalin 10mg for 12 days now. The 1st week he had only morning dose at 8am. This wore off around 1pm. This week I&#039;ve dosed him 4 hours later also. From 1st day the change was amazing. He was attentive and followed instruction throughout his swim lesson and his school teacher found great improvement in attention span, concentration and finishing tasks. He is not as angry or frustrated now. The only negative is that I find he gets emotional and &#039;teary&#039; as it wears off.""",1
Perphenazine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Trilafon for 2 years now. Mostly I liked it at first because it brought me back to earth when I was over anxious. I have lowered my dosage since then and I thought it was doing me well, but I have been having neck problems lately and have realized that this is a side effect of Trilafon called extra-pyramidal syndrome that damages my posture area, so no matter how hard I try I can&#039;t regain a good posture.

Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Started on saxenda 2-6-17.  Started with injections about noon.  First day was fine.  Second and third day i was nauseated bad all day.  Could not eat but made myself eat crackers.  Today I am over the nausea but did have some diarrhea.  But now feeling fine.  I work at a medical office.  The nurses told me to hang in and it would get better.  They were right.  They also said to stay on .6 until I felt better not to up the dose.  It just takes time for your body to adjust to it.  Did also drink 7 up to help,""",3
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Varying levels of depression since early 20&#039;s.  Anxiety also an issue.  2 bouts of major depression: one in late 40&#039;s and one in mid 50&#039;s.  No hospitalizations.  Now 63 yo.  Taking 200mg for 2yrs, -  minimal side effects, and very effective in mood regulation.  Never had a manic episode, but had been fairly quick to anger and somewhat argumentative.  I would have to say this medicine has helped a lot.  Some changes in my life circumstances may also be helping  (retired) --  but I have to give this medication an endorsement.  Worry a bit about taking it long-term -- but so far, no side effects.""",6
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""As a 16 year old junior in highschool, I never seemed to really notice how much I didn&#039;t pay attention to things that didn&#039;t interest me. As my family and friends have been saying how important getting good grades in junior year is, I thought deeply about it and found out that maybe I just don&#039;t care. Although it wasn&#039;t that, I really do care, but I just never wanted to sit down and do the homework. Because it&#039;s not interesting, even though I know how important it is. I eventually brought this to my mothers attention and she even noticed it for awhile, that maybe I have ADD. Eventually we went to a special Dr, he concluded I have mild/moderate ADD, started me on 15mg last month, didn&#039;t last all school day, and today i just picked up my 25mg""",1
Avinza,Pain,"""I have had chronic pancreatitis for 6 years and have to be careful about taking pain medicines because I&#039;m a recovering alcoholic. In fact have to be careful about taking anything at all. But I was living in pain regularly and needed something for the chronic abdominal pain and the medicines given were a slippery slope for me. I was referred to a pain clinic where they set me up with Avinza. It has been a true blessing! I have no euphoria, drugged feeling, cravings or any problems or side effects with Avinza. It takes care of the pain for the full 24 hours, and I do have Percocet as needed for breakthrough. I have been on the regimen for several years now and have not had to increase the dose. It has given me my quality of life back.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking the pills in October 2015 weighing 214 lbs, after taking them a month I lost 17 lbs, then another 11 lbs in the second month, weighing 186.  I ran out on December 26th, 2015 and didn&#039;t have the money to get them again until the 31st of December.  I ate like a monster those four days and was certain I&#039;d gained like 30 lbs, but I still weighed in at 186 on the 31st when I started taking them again and I&#039;m excited to see how much I can lose this month! I have a gym membership and try to go to at least one Zumba class a week, but it&#039;s hard sometimes during the week so I can&#039;t say any of the weight loss is attributed to exercise. Prior to taking the pills I cut out most carbs and all breads from my regular diet.""",3
Strattera,ADHD,"""My son, now 10, was diagnosed with impulse control issues. He has always had As and Bs in school and always loves to read. He gets bored alot in class and his impulse control (blurting out, saying what&#039;s on his mind/no filter) had caused him to be put in alternative school (where his grades began to falter). Over the summer, we had him evaluated and they said that meds would help. Our general physician didn&#039;t want to put him on a stimulant and suggested Straterra. First 2 months @ 60mg. Lost 15lbs (which put him at the right weight actually) and slept all the time. Backed off to 40mg since then and he&#039;s maintained his weight, sleeps well and maintained grades. Too bad our monthly script cost increased x9. Looking for a cheaper alternative.""",1
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I was looking forward to swapping my BCP to a lower hormonal, longer lasting option. UNTIL I started reading internet testiments. I psyched myself out so bad with the negative reviews I did happen to find, and almost called off my appointment. Alas, the morning of, I popped 800 mg of Motrin and listened to some classical music while practicing my breathing on the way to the doctor&#039;s. The whole thing took 4 minutes tops and the pain (more like an intense pinching cramp) lasted maybe a half a minute. All of that for nothing! I even got sweaty and woozy from preparing for the impending torture that never happened. I went home, proclaimed myself a superhero to my boyfriend, and even ran some errands. Oh and no kids """,8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I was having trouble conceiving so, I had tests done, DNC (just to clean the inside and make sure it was OK), got put on a fertility pills but they made me gain weight. I started adipex July 18th weight was 305 pounds. I&#039;m always thirsty with dry mouth, quit drinking everything except water and coffee, only eating low carb foods, and when I get hungry I only eat little portions and I get full faster. I do not have a job and don&#039;t exercise everyday but I&#039;m constantly doing something or going somewhere and the meds have really helped in my weight loss, self confidence, and changed my life style. As if August 17th I am down to 289 pounds, I have lost 16 lbs in 1 month. Currently on month 2 will post as weight loss continues.""",3
Yasmin,Birth Control,"""It was terrible. I took it years ago when it first came out. Yasmin 28, I think. My mood was down, I had upset stomach all the time. I couldn&#039;t handle diary or fats. I always felt anxious. I told my gyno, he shrugged it off as normal. Then the tipping point was when I was on the bus and I started feeling lightheaded and then lost my vision. A friend helped me off the bus where I had to sit and breathe in the cool fall air in order to regain my composure and slowly my vision came back. I stopped the pill immediately after that. My peroid only came back 3 months later and it took years before it was on track again. I went online and many women had same issues and had trouble starting a family after stopping the pill. Dangerous stuff.""",8
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I pass chronic kidney stones and have had numerous stones removed via surgery. A few times my kidneys have shut down via urine back pumping from obstructing stones. In this case a shot of Dilaudid every 15 minutes kept me laughing and giggling with the nurses. Amazing stuff.  For my day to day pain from stones and stone related damage to my urinary tract Dilaudid is really the only medicine which is proven to help time and time again. I&#039;ve been on every pain medicine it seems over the years and while Demerol is a close second, Dilaudid is what keeps me productive at work.  I&#039;m on 8mg but cut them in half as needed. """,9
Contrave,Obesity,"""This is truly a mind altering drug. Takes the lust with food out of your mind. I had difficulty the first two days I went from 3/day to four..so I backed off to 3 again for another week and then did fine when I increased. I do have headaches, but I have never had the nausea ppl talk about except for the day I increased to 4. I have asthma and hypertension. Both are doing well on this drug. I have lost 11.9 lbs in 5 weeks. I do not feel deprived. I still enjoy an occasional sweet treat, and have still lost weight on those days. The main thing that I have eliminated is snacking. I really don&#039;t have any desire to do that. I drink a lot more water now too. This drug does seems to give a dry mouth.  Very happy with this drug.""",2
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I was recently diagnosed with endometriosis and my gynaecologist initially recommended the Mirena to help manage it. The inserting process was impossible and so dismissed. Next up was the patch... Worst decision of my life. Nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue.. That lasted me 3 days. Next up was the Nuva Ring. I&#039;m going into my third week and so far it&#039;s doing better than anything else I&#039;ve tried. My side effects are awful headaches and cramps here and there. Other than that I feel perfectly fine. If the headache gets bad I simply use a pain killer and voila! I&#039;ll definitely recommend to anyone that can&#039;t use a high dose contraceptive like me. I think the low dose in the ring could make a huge difference. Can&#039;t knock it till you try it!""",8
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I gave this method a birth control a 10 because it worked too damn good!!
No periods. No pregnancies. That was the one thing it was GREAT for. However on the flip side of that it made my hormones go buck wild. Suicidal thoughts &amp; actions. Anxiety. Paranoid. Depression. Back pain. For the longest , I ignored all these signs. I thought I was going crazy. It was inserted back in 2010. It was only good for 3 years. By the 2nd year I noticed a difference in me. I was very anxious. Irritable. Low patience. Not like me at all. People didn&#039;t understand why I was tripping. Hell I didn&#039;t understand it myself . I told multiple people &quot;there is something wrong&quot; I need help. Not realizing that the only help  I needed was for them to take this thing out!!""",8

I am 21 years old I started out at 289 Lbs and is of today I&#039;m 274 lb with that being said I have done a total life change. I quit eating fast food, and any sweets, no soda or energy drinks, and the hardest one for me is I have dropped from drinking around 30 beers a week to my limit or 2 a week. It has been hard but I know it is totally worth it! The only side effect I have seen is my blood pressure seems to by high for the first couple hours I take it.""",3
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I was so excited to start taking Contrave after reading all these reviews. I did not have any side effects. I took Contrave for 1 month and did not lose any weight. I signed up for the Scaledown scale and liked the fact of weighing in daily and being accountable. I was disappointed to not have any weight change but to fluctuate 2 lbs every few days. I was eating 1,200-1,500 calories a day as well. Time to try a different medication.""",3
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been on Strattera for a month and am currently taking 60mg a day for ADHD and anxiety. I&#039;m also taking Lexapro and Buspar. So far, I&#039;ve experienced no side effects and this has been almost a miracle. My anxiety is almost gone, I am able to think more clearly and concentrate on work and other obligations. I&#039;m much less impulsive than before taking Strattera and I tend to think things through before acting. 

My only complaint is the cost. My insurance doesn&#039;t cover my medicine.""",1
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I have been suffering with abominable head/back pain (pain lasting around the clock for up to 4-5 days straight) as well as abdominal pains with constant vomiting and no ability to lead a normal life including having to take a leave of absence from my job.  In &#039;11 alone I was hospitalized 4 times 4 months in a row. One stay I was vomiting blood and passing it in my stool. In the ER Dilaudid IV gave me relief. Was given it every 2 hours. Zofran and Dilaudid helped at home too. My doctor put me on Vicodin inlieu of Dilaudid saying the latter was habit forming. Since then no relief of pains. Dilaudid 4mg helped great. Miracle medicine.""",9
Lithobid,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been taking Lithium for almost 2 years now. It is actually amazing mood wise and it helped me get over my social anxiety. The side effects I&#039;ve had which technically are not good at all, but are almost worth how I feel are. I had to be put on blood pressure medicines, my hair is sheding a lot more than normal. I have more acne than I used to, and the worst one. I&#039;ve gained about 25 pounds which for me wasn&#039;t good I was already overweight. Oh and I haven&#039;t had a period for almost three months now (not pregnant) my doctor thinks Lithium might be to blame. I&#039;m only 25 by the way, so I should still have a period. Besides all of this Lithium was the best thing to ever happen to me.""",6
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;m a 33 yr old female who has experienced mild acne for most of my life. I have tried everything from over the counter products to antibiotics for 3 months. It was just recently that I started using Atralin (3 weeks now) &amp; I don&#039;t need to worry about wearing makeup anymore (dream come true). This medication is definitely worth a try paired with other treatments. I currently get a chemical peel once a month, plexion cloths to wash 2x a day and Atralin at night. If my skin continues this way I will be a happier person as I don&#039;t even worry about hiding my face anymore. """,4
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I suffered a neurotoxic reaction to another drug, metronidazole; it caused lesions for form on my brain.  This led to neuropsychiatric symptoms, including severe anxiety, major depression, suicidal thoughts (just a month before, I was happy), and horrible insomnia.  I was given mirtazapine and it greatly helped, especially the insomnia.  I had barely slept for eight days--even  Ambien couldn&#039;t knock me out after the first night (I&#039;d never taken a sleeping pill in my life and even Ambien couldn&#039;t help).  Mirtazapine was a life-saver, literally.  Metronidazole had overstimulated my central nervous system and mirtazapine helped to calm it down.  It took longer to treat the other symptoms, but they, too, resolved.""",0
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Adipex(phentermine) is great for weight loss.  I did experience minor side effects (i.e. dry mouth, insomnia.) I have taken this medicine on and off for several years.  I noticed rapid weight loss the first time I took it, losing over 30 pounds in the first month.  I was 202lbs when I took it the first time and after only 1 month I was down to about 170lbs.  I went off of the medicine for several months, didn&#039;t exercise and returned to my original eating habits, regaining all of the weight plus some.  The second time I took it I didn&#039;t experience the same rapid weight loss I had with the first attempt, only getting down to about 182lbs. Going for try #3 but will do it right this time with exercise and diet change for life!""",2
Olanzapine,Insomnia,"""I do have really bad insomnia (for the past 6 years) but this was prescribed to me for daytime use to help keep me calm. It in no way makes me sleepy but works great for my ADHD. I have also gained nearly 10 pounds in only 2 weeks. I&#039;m not a normal eater, usually I only eat dinner, but on this medicine I seem to have doubled what I would normally eat. I&#039;m addressing that issue now. Good calming down medicine I must say.""",0

I&#039;ve been very happy with it so far. I decided to get the Mirena when my doctor informed me that I had osteoarthritis due to the Depo shot I had been taking for 3 years. When I had it placed it was painful at first, but it only lasted for about 12 hours. My periods came back but are very light to nonexistent. I&#039;m extremely thankful that the Mirena doesn&#039;t have the side effects that are associated with other forms of birth control. I have absolutely no complaints with it. I love it, and cannot wait to have the new one inserted. I would recommend to everyone!""",8
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I have been struggling with my weight for a few years now.  I was more and more depressed and my anxiety was through the roof with all the weight I was gaining.  My doctor offered me phentermine and because of all of the things I have heard about it I said no.  About 6 months went by and I was continuing to gain weight.  I finally gave in and decided to give it a try.

Thank goodness I decided to try it for myself and not listen to what I had heard.  I was very afraid to try it because I do have major anxiety.  I tired it on a Sunday when I didn&#039;t have to be at work.  It was such a great decision.  I have not experienced any of the side effects except my breath isn&#039;t the greatest.  I have been taking it for almost 2 months.  It has helped me lose weight""",2
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""This is my second time on Lexapro. I took a 6 month break because I am not usually one for long-term medicine and it was causing me to gain weight.

However, I am too a point in my life where I feel like my GAD is just going to slowly kill me if I don&#039;t keep it under control (I am 26). Anyway, I&#039;ve never had any side-effects to this drug other than weight gain. And, I hope it&#039;s not the placebo effect, but I swear this stuff works the first day. I can feel my anxiety riddled, tense muscles loosening more and more. Give it a try! It&#039;s worth a shot to feel better!""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I never really had acne until my senior year in high school. I always washed my face before I went to bed, and I tried about every type of face wash you can think of. It took me a year to go to the dermatologist just because when my acne seemed to be getting bad it would clear up again. I never had cystic acne, but I still felt uncomfortable with my skin. I finally decided to go to a dermatologist, and I&#039;m so thankful I did. I&#039;ve been on this medicine for almost a month, and my skin is just so much better. The doctor put me on the 100 mg medicine for a total of 3 months, &amp; I also use Tretinoin cream a few times a week. Cetaphil face wash, and Aveeno moisturizer are also things I use on the daily to keep my skin clean and from drying out.""",4
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have been taking Vyvanse for 4 years now and I have been on the same dose of 30mg for severe ADHD. A lot of people have trouble staying on the same dose and need to increase because they get used to the drug. Just a tip: take as needed and when you feel the effects wearing off? Drink a one-shot espresso drink NOT an energy drink. Overall, if you are looking for a good ADHD medication I would recommend either Focalin OR Vyvanse. Best of luck!""",1

I am tired all the time.  I can barely stay awake within an hour of taking it.  I am emotionless.  Never feel better than a 5 out of 10.  Don&#039;t feel happiness.  No joy in any activities.  It&#039;s definitely good at evening you out....too good.  It has not conquered my depression.  I find it hard to focus and it is starting to effect my job.  I just want to feel happy again.""",6
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I believe I have found the answer I have been looking for! Been on it about two months. I sleep throught the night with a lot less interruption and I fall asleep more quickly.  My thought pattern is far less anxious and muddled; I am able to concentrate.  My mood is far less out of whack and I am generally happy.  The only downside for me is it gives me the munchies and I have diabetes, so I have gained some weight a bit rapidly.  However, with a lot of effort, I have eliminated foods out of my diet that are carbs. I am starting to level out and I have a lot of hope for the future with this medicine. It is expensive, but I have good insurance.""",6

I have also develop moderate to severe cystic acne (i had clear skin before) the acne is all down my chest, chack, forehead and dotted across my face. The dermatologist prescribed an antibiotic, I have been on it a week and the acne has gotten worse. Feeling like the Liletta may have been a mistake?

Tramadol,Pain,"""I was taking 3-4 Lortab&#039;s a day 7.5 for 2 years for chronic low back pain. My new Doctor won&#039;t write narcotics for chronic pain, so he gave me Ultram 25mg. I was worried about withdrawal from Lortab, but I had none, zero, I don&#039;t know how I just didn&#039;t because I have run out in the past and had withdrawals. I like Ultram. I take it less than the Lortab and it works just as well. I think Lortab &quot;made&quot; my body hurt so I would take more of it (if that makes sense). I need 50mg sometimes 100mg to get relief and I can not take Ultram ER. If you are taking that, that may be why you are having dizzy spells ... it made my vertigo crazy!""",9

Headaches, a little nausea, slight rough throat and fatigue. I have lost 10 pounds in this week with minimal exercise, perhaps 10/15 minutes on the elliptical a night and some free weights. I%u2019m in love with this product. I have ZERO appetite. I have to force myself to eat and even then end up eating two bites and throwing the rest away.

I was skimming the reviews and thankfully, I have not had any of the side affects that others have had.  I make sure to take after I&#039;ve had some breakfast, like I do with vitamins.  The only challenge I have found is getting all fours pills in.  I&#039;ve got to carry them in the evening to ensure I have them with me to take.  I have had a small bit of constipation, but I have increased my daily fiber pills and things got better.  I&#039;m looking forward in seeing what month 2 can do for me :)""",2
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder almost five years ago and have tried just about every medication without success.  I have recently started taking Saphris and it is my miracle. My mood swings have gone and I&#039;m no longer angry or depressed.  I have plenty of energy (minus the mania) and feel a complete sense of well being. The dissolvable wafers have a very bitter taste however this is a very small price to pay considering how awesome I feel.  """,6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""So today is day 4 on phentermine. Starting out I cut out all processed foods and high carb foods and soda. I am only drinking water. I&#039;ve also been trying to stay active and have been on two 2 mile walks along with my regular moving around over the past few days. I have lost 6lbs!!!!

GW: 140LBS
CW: 226LBS

It&#039;s probably mainly water weight. But still nice to see a decrease on the scale. :)""",3
Cariprazine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m happy to see that this drug has worked for some but it certainly did not work right for me.  After the initial days getting it into my system I started crying for no reason multiple times a day.  I figured I was just getting used to it and stuck with it through the dosage increase. The following day I basically cried all day and had suicidal thoughts that I just could not seem to get out of my head.  My Dr had me stop taking it immediately and we performed a genomind DNA test to see which drugs would work for me. Vrylar showed up on the &quot;High Risk&quot; list along with a number of other anti-psychotics.  Unfortunately my list of treatment options for Bipolar I is not very long.""",6
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I have suffered from the pain of arthritis and disc degeneration in my lower back and neck. I also have fibromyalgia.  As if that wasn&#039;t enough, I have been recently diagnosed with Bi-polar disorder. This medication has been great for me. I&#039;ve only been on it for 4 days and already my pain has been greatly reduced. I haven&#039;t had to take any Percocet which is great. I have had to take a couple Tylenol. It has also really helped reduce my anxiety and depression. I really hope it keeps working. I take 300 mg about 1 PM and two 300 mg capsules at night. Side effects are minimal. I&#039;m still a bit drowsy in the morning but it&#039;s nothing a good cup of coffee won&#039;t cure.  It has been a great medication for me.""",9
Minocycline,Acne,"""I am a 24yr old female, I&#039;ve had moderate acne since I was 13. I&#039;m along with the many of you who have tried everything... 
I&#039;ve done two rounds of Accutane (17yrs and 22 yrs) which cleared up my skin for about 1.5-2yrs. However, this time I started breaking out worse than ever. I didn&#039;t want to go back on Accutane due to the cost and responsibility (monthly blood work, monthly derm. visits, monthly pregnancy tests, copays &amp; cost = nightmare) so I was recently put onto 100MG twice a day in addition to topical Aczone (am) and Tazorac (pm). 

I have only been on it for a week, and so far and have noticed no huge side effects other than dry eyes and a little unusually tired. Nothing extreme, we&#039;ll see how it goes.""",4
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I started with the 37 mg dose for mild-moderate depression I had experienced this past year.  I felt calm and peaceful for the first few weeks.  The doctor had me increase the dose to 75mg.  I tried for a month to adjust to it, but all I wanted to do was sleep.  It took away my energy and I fought fatigue.  I reduced back down to 37 mg and felt pretty good for a couple of months, but started to notice trouble responding to people around me.  It felt like being in a daze that took some effort to break.  I also started to feel out of sorts and frenzied.  I decided to stop the medicine a few weeks ago and feel 100% better.  No more confusion or anxiety!  This medicine was definitely not a good match for my body chemistry.""",5
Lexapro,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on 10mg Lexapro for a couple weeks now and feel much more capable of keeping myself in check during &quot;tough&quot; situations.  This is my second time on this Lexapro.  The first was a few years ago in what ultimately became a failed marriage.  Now, happily remarried, to a supportive woman with GAD, I am on it again.  This time though it is not my wife causing the the stress (good thing) and I think because of that, the medicine is working much more effectively, which brings me to my point.  Unless you change the things in your life, your life will not change.""",5
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have taken this medicine for about six months now.  It has been such a life changer for me! I was on depakote as a mood stabilizer for my not terribly severe bipolar disorder. Depakote caused weight gain. Since I have been on Trileptal, I have lost 30lbs and feel great.  I am just about to start my student teaching in college and I am more confident than ever that I will succeed with flying colors.""",6
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I have PCOS and hypothyroidism so losing weight is difficult for me. My Doctor prescribed Contrave 3 months ago. At first, the side effects were very difficult. I was nauseated and I felt really dizzy. At first, I didn&#039;t lose that much weight with it either; however, after about 2 weeks started losing weight and am currently down 25 pounds. I was very lucky as my prescription drug insurance changed at the beginning of this year and the new plan covers it with only a copay of $80 for a 3-months supply. I am thrilled with that. I have had constipation, but nothing that I cannot handle.  I would suggest this drug if you have metabolic diseases. For me, the cravings disappeared, but I feel my body is burning more calories in the process.""",3
Strattera,ADHD,"""I have been on it a few months, with great results for my ADD. I have greater concentration and am up getting things done, instead of vegging in front of the tube. The major drawback has been sweating. I was getting chills and sweating a lot! Originally thought it could be hormones, but not after reading others&#039; comments matching my symptoms. I was jittery at first, but now smooth sailing. I tell lots of people how happy I am with the results. I loved Welbutrin but am allergic.""",1
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I have been taking Tenuate 25mg three times a day for three weeks now and I have lost a total of 8 1/2 lbs. I eat smaller portions of food and watch what I eat and don&#039;t eat after 6:00 pm. I drink a lot of water and now my doctor started me on a diuretic to help me get rid of my water weight. So far this medication has helped and I am looking to see more results and I will keep you posted. Good luck to everyone.""",2
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I have been on contrave since October 2016. I have currently lost 30lbs. I started my weight loss in February 2016 at 225lb. I am a 5&#039;9&quot; 35yr female. The first months I was on adipex and lost 50lbs with that plus diet and exercise. I currently weight 145lb and consider myself at a stopping point. I feel contrave  is highly effective. Especially along with the scale down program. I do not have an side effects that bother me to much to stop. Mostly dry mouth. For those of you who don&#039;t give it enough time I highly encourage you to give it more time.""",3
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I just finished the first week on Contrave. 52 yr old female, 5&#039;5 182. I was already taking Wellbutrin so I didn&#039;t have to adjust, first week I cut my Wellbutrin dose in half and I will completely go off it as I titrated up. So, no side effects! Lost 4 pounds the first week. Just started the two per day and I couldn&#039;t finish my salad for dinner because I was full. I have also been able to cut out wine, I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m not craving it. I&#039;m hoping to lose 30 pounds and will add exercise.""",3
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am diagnosed with schizoaffective Bipolar. I spent 8 years trying every psychiatric medication on the market to no avail. I never found stability my life was made up of rapid cycles of extreme moods one week I would be happy confident and secure the next week I would be extremely depressed often suicidal had 6 serious suicide attempts and was hospitalized 22 times. Nothing worked at least not for long. I was put on lithium 2 years ago along with the two other medications, I was on an antidepressant and an antipsychotic. Lithium saved my life I have had no suicidal thoughts, my life is no longer ruled by extreme moods although I can be a little emotional at times I am able to remain logical and in control something I could never do before.""",6
Wellbutrin XL,ADHD,"""I&#039;M bipolar and ADHD. I took Tegretol and Effexor for 8 years. It worked for me but it was a death embrace. Cognitive functions related to attention willpower  judgement declined. Read about lithiums neuroprotective properties and switched, which is working out for me. I added Wellbutrin 300 XL for the ADHD  3 weeks ago and so far it has increased my depression, it might be settling down though, I seem to be getting better. This has to work. These are bad days. Wish I had taken Lithium 10 years ago it has also helped with the ADHD.""",1
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""For the first few months, I bled everyday. After 2-3 injections, the bleeding stopped for the most part, with occasional random bleeding now and then, and light bleeding near the time I was due for my next shot.

Yes, you WILL very likely experience the &quot;breakthrough bleeding&quot; side effect, and it can be annoying having to use pads/tampons constantly, but if you can deal with that, it is a great birth control solution.

I have smoked cigarettes while using Depo. This caused an increase in bleeding when I regularly smoked. I noticed after 3-4 injections when my bleeding lessened to almost a stop, if I smoked cigarettes, I would bleed later. So if you smoke, this might affect how much/often you bleed.""",8
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""So far, so good despite being sceptical.I have tried many things over years to loose weight. My Dr recommended this might help for ongoing chronic back pain and said loosing 10-15kgs might make the world of difference.I have a great fear of needles but they really don&#039;t hurt. Some stinging - rubbing injection site just with fingers afterward helps.  Gaviscon helped with the burping. Coloxal for constipation. I haven&#039;t changed my diet but can&#039;t eat as much, don&#039;t feel like alcohol and so far have lost 2kg in 2.5 weeks.  I&#039;ve never been able to get under 80kgs so the next few weeks will tell.  So far so good. I&#039;ll keep you updated. A bit tired but supplements help. I would recommend giving this a go. Sign up through the trial prog.""",3
Ketorolac,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had migraines for years, as you all know, they come and go. I&#039;ve taken the Imitrex shot and orally, Zomig, Maxalt, among others. My family practicioner prescribes me Flexeril on top of Maxalt. Today, though, I ran out, and had to go to a clinic, and even though I fear needles, I asked for the shot. This was a migraine I knew I was no match for, as my pain threshold peaked a number of times. Immediate burning in my bottom and leg, but it did work well. I wish this were able to be prescribed""",9
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I used the full Obaji package for four months and gradually stopped using their sunblock and skin correction lotions because the breakouts where 100x worse than before I started the treatment for mild acne.

I did keep telling myself that my skin would have more breakouts and then improve but 4 months was a long time to wait. 

Now I only use the tretinoin cream and it had been great. I only have one or two spots max but overall my skin is clear. 

I use the oil free moisturiser by murad to protect my skin against UV light and I&#039;m really pleased with the results.""",4
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve now been on this medication for 8 weeks. I&#039;ve lost 20lbs. No side effects except dry mouth sometimes and being tired sometimes. The weight is just falling off of me. I look great again. I will continue this drug until I lost another 20lbs. I&#039;ve tried a lot of medications for weight loss and non worked. This is actually working. My insurance covers most of the fee. Have your doctor call in the needles also and you get those cheaper.""",3
Vilazodone,Anxiety,"""My wife had been on Clonazepam for five years or so for her anxiety. She is a very vital, thin 50, but her libido had disappeared and she had delayed orgasm. She also had recurring upper respiratory infections and a cough she couldn&#039;t get rid of. I researched and found that one was a common side effect (the sexual aspect) and one rare (the cough). I had her go to her doctor and ask to get on Viibryd. She has had only minor side effects, but none of the gastrointestinal issues. Within three weeks the cough has almost disappeared, and last night she had multiple orgasm for the first time in 22 years since I&#039;ve known her. Oh yeah, and the anxiety seems to be less. Needless to say, we&#039;re big Viibryd fans already.""",7
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I started taken one 25mg topiramate two days ago, Wednesday June 28th, with one 37.5 mg of phentermine tablet, 1/x daily.  June 28th Starting weight 225.1 on Friday June 30th, which was 2 days later, I&#039;m 217lbs I&#039;ve dropped 8.1 lbs in 2 day. OMG! I&#039;m praying this continues to work out for me because I need/want to lose 58+lbs. I&#039;ve really struggled with my weight for the past 7 years, On and off different diets, going to gym, personal trainer etc... my doctor wants my body to stay in ketosis. I know I can do this!""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I began having acne at age 20. Went to a ton of doctors was put on doxy for 6 months, lots of topicals, and accutane, and none of it worked. Five years later it turns out my testosterone levels were way too high and I have Polycystic ovarian syndrome. Gyno put me on 200mg a day. First month I was very nauseous and dizzy. I wanted to sleep all the time. It&#039;s been two months and the side effects are gone, but I&#039;m still breaking out. Hopefully it works after a couple more months. I suggest any adult acne sufferer try this out before you spend years trying things that are not effective. My acne scars are awful and I need dermabrasion now.""",4
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I suffered from anxiety for many years and as I got older it became horrible. Palpitations and things that do not seem to bother others would destroy me on the inside. I began taking Lexapro 10mg. At first it did help but then I started to have long lasting headaches...sensitive to light and feeling that I was &quot;numb&quot; from the neck up. I completely shut out the outside and withdrew from 90% of everything I liked. I read all of the reviews about the medicine as far a getting off of it, and I felt that it was pushing me further into a hole. I decided to take it every other day for one week, then half the dose and half the days. My advice is drink lots of water/ Fish oil every other day/ You must walk/ Eat even if you must force yourself/Sleep at night.""",7
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started at 25 mg of Lamictal. After 2 weeks my doctor increased it to 50 mg. 2 weeks after increasing my med I noticed a minor skin rash on my chest one night. I overlooked it &amp; continued taking the Lamictal. When my doctor increased it to 100 mg that is when I started having a bad reaction. That night I broke out in a bad rash on my chest, stomach &amp; left arm (not my right arm). I also started having bad chest pains. I called my doctors office the next day &amp; the nurse told me to stop taking the Lamictal &amp; go to the hospital. I&#039;m stubborn, so I refused to go. My chest pains had gone away &amp; the rash was clearing up, so I wasn&#039;t as worried about it as I was the night before. I decided to go to the EmergiCare instead &amp; I turned out to be OK""",6
Ramelteon,Insomnia,"""My doctor refused to support a prescription for low-dose (5 mg) zolpidem after my insurance company would not approve its filling.  Instead he prescribed 20 mg rozerem.  Now my problem is not insomnia, but rather an infrequent occasion where I have not fallen asleep.  For that 2.5 mg zolpidem was the perfect answer.  I have now tried rozerem 5 times for the past two plus months.  1.5 hours later I am mellow, but not asleep.  Moreover, I do not feel that a good night&#039;s rest results. The worst was several weeks ago where asthmatic breathing was keeping me awake.  Somewhere around 11:30 I took a pill.  At 1:30, I was still wired.  Finally in the 4 plus range I resorted to a benadryl and somehow got about 3 hours worth.""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on Contrave for 5 weeks now, started at 360lbs when I went to the Dr. to get it prescribed and weighed in at 328 this morning, so down 32lbs. Contrave is not a magic pill, unfortunately no such thing exists or none of us would be overweight or obese. However, what I feel it did for me was give me motivation, which is exactly what my Dr. told me it would help do. I haven&#039;t been this razor focused on eating clean, lifting heavy and doing cardio in over 10 years. Paired with morning fasted cardio, clean diet of 5 meals a day high protien/moderate fat/low-moderate carb, and 5x a week of weight lifting, Contrave can be an amazing boost and the edge you need to actually want to stick with it. I have had zero side effects. Stay focused""",2
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;m a 56 years old, 5&#039;2&quot; 230 female (or I was when I started Contrave).  After reading all of the reviews, I was terrified of the side effects, but I had to have something that might help me shed some weight. To date I&#039;ve experienced little to no side effects and have lost 11 lbs going into my 3rd week. Probably my only complaint is that I do get sleepy from time to time, but nothing that isn&#039;t manageable.  I&#039;m more able to resist my favorite foods and I have the energy to get up and move now.  Let&#039;s hope this is the continued trend.""",2
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""Was prescribed 2 mg tablets to be taken 1 or 2 pills every 3 or 4 hours after my complicated rotator cuff surgery which involved reattaching three completely torn through tendons. The pills were completely ineffective. They did nothing for my pain. I quit taking them after the first day.  I could not tell that I had taken anything. The circulating ice water machine they send you home from surgery with and regular Advil provided much better relief.""",9
Dapsone,Acne,"""I started breaking out for the first time when I turned 20 years old.  It was terrible, cystic acne and I tried everything before going to the dermatologist.  When I finally did, I was prescribed Aczone and Retin-A.  During the first three weeks, my skin got worse.  All my cystic acne rose to the top and turned into white heads.  My skin also become flaky at the same time from the Retin-A.  I wanted to stop and give up, but so glad I didn&#039;t.  Now my skin is almost completely clear and it&#039;s been 6 weeks.  Please don&#039;t give up on this treatment.  Continue to use it as your doctor prescribed and you will see results.  I still have some redness but overall my skin is smooth and I finally feel comfortable in it!""",4
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""Amazing. I thought my life was over. I dealt with anxiety since childhood. At times it was worse than others but in the past 9 months it has become so severe that it manifested into unbearable physical symptoms. I was experiencing a cycle of extreme hot flashes that would drench me in sweat, the hot sweat turned to cold dampness quickly turning to violent chills. Uncontrollable heaving made me vomit a dozen times a day. I would wake every day in a full blown anxiety attack. I wasn&#039;t able to eat or even quit shivering. I lost 15 pounds in 3 weeks, was so emaciated, dehydrated I really felt like I was dying. In 3 days Buspar made me feel NORMAL. Not zombied or depressed like other medicines. Buspar saved my life, or at least gave me the ability to live.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""So I got the implant about 3 months ago and got it taken out yesterday and I will tell you why. Within 3 months my anxiety increased about 50 fold, I gained 11 pounds while eating healthy and organic food. My abdominal has been bloated like 5 pounds the whole time. Very uncomfortable and kinda painful to press on it. I got 2 UTI&#039;s back to back (which never happens). Had a short temper, overly emotional and angry a lot for no reason. My fianc&eacute; told me my whole personality changed and that I was going from being sweet and kind to a mean and hateful person. Not to mention I would freak out over the littlest things! I already feel less crazy with that thing out of me. I just hope my bloating and pain will go away soon....""",8
Topamax,Obesity,"""I suffer from migraines and also am overweight. So the Dr prescribed me topamax for both. I weighed in at 209 on Feb 2 2016 and today Feb 12 2016 I am 203. So far so good with the weight loss. I&#039;m not to pleased with the side affects however. I feel fuzzy all day. Like I&#039;m on a cloud, Dizzy.  Tingling and nubness in my fingers and toes. Hasn&#039;t helped my migraines at all either.  It does though not make me hungry at all. I have to force myself to eat because I know I have too. I don&#039;t see myself taking this medication long term. I&#039;d rather try and lose the weight naturally. Not worth all the side affects""",2
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve suffered with depression, anxiety and panic along with various health problems. I have tried just about most medicines that claim to help with these problems. Nothing, until I tried Klonopin and it just changed so much about me. Although I will say in the beginning I felt very cheery and super friendly. Though that particular feeling has decreased it still controls my anxiety. And no side effects, only thing is that it doesn&#039;t help with sleep so I take a Seroquel instead at night.It also helps keep me calm when worrying over my bad health conditions. Found deep belly breathing can help while in the midst of a panic. I plan on staying on it. Take care.""",7
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""So basically since I was around 20 (I&#039;m 36 now) I&#039;ve suffered from general anxiety and horrible panic attacks, really bad hypochondria. I&#039;ve gone to the hospital thinking I was dying of everything. I graduated from an Ivy League college and suffered the entire time. Finally I decided to bite the billet and try lexapro (brand name not generic). I started at 10mg and had a week of terrible side effects including: depression, couldn&#039;t cry, weird feelings hard to describe, insomnia, increased anxiety, fatigue, all around shaky feeling. I couldn&#039;t deal with it so I started to cut the pills in half to 5 mg- side effects went away except I have increased libido (it gets annoying). No panic attacks. Still have anxiety a little tiny bit.""",7
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I was put on Klonopin about four years ago.  It worked very well until I made a change from 1 mg that was blue to a .5 that was yellow, both by Sandoz.   I was trying to make it easier to break in half and lower my dose. After about 4 months I began to notice as soon as I took the .5 yellow tablet, I would break out into a sweat all over my body like I was having an allergic reaction.  It was during this time I developed Burning Tongue Syndrome.  On the blue 1mg it began to feel like icy hot was put on my legs.  I was trying to see if anyone else had these symptoms. I may have gotten a bad batch of Generics but if I have it was on three different refills.  Something has changed with this medication.""",7
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I am not able to use oral contraceptives containing estrogen, as I have migraines with auras (which puts me at a highly increased risk of stroke). As such, I have been getting Depo-Provera shots for the past 2 years. I have not gained any weight at all while on the shot and my weight has remained extremely constant. I stopped getting periods altogether after the second shot and have had very light spotting only a few times (lasting less than a day). My only issue is that my sex drive has decreased slightly, but not severely enough that it has significantly affected my relationship with my boyfriend. I think the shot affects everyone differently, but for me it is the best option available and I have not had many side effects using it.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Im a 54 year old male, 5 11&quot; 300 lbs.
Been taking it for 3 months; lost 30 lbs. Have lots of energy for yard work and exercise. I was a compulsive eater, but now I can walk by donuts with no pain. made progress eating better and less.  I Take it first thing with water, then don&#039;t eat till late afternoon.  Seems to reduce my desire to eat. Makes me appreciate lighter foods over heavy foods.  I have more physical and mental energy.  Only negative is makes it a little harder to sleep.

Its actually possible, some day I will not be the fattest guy I know.""",3
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed Ambien, then later Ambien CR, for several years for insomnia.  Wow!  Just like I&#039;d heard about -- take the pill and 20 minutes later I was out.  Didn&#039;t really experience &quot;hangover&quot; the next day, but then I allowed myself 7 +/- hours of sleep.  Then, it happened:  woke up one morning and my kitchen was somewhat of a mess but I didn&#039;t remember being up or making tuna salad on toast.  That happened a few more times before I weaned myself off Ambien.  Haven&#039;t had a good night&#039;s sleep since.  I&#039;ve been prescribed a few different sleep meds but haven&#039;t had any success.  Tried OTC diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Motrin PM) with Melatonin and began not remembering simple words, appointments, etc.""",0
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I would rate this with a negative number if I could. I got the implant in October of 2015. I loved it the first month then everybody noticed my attitude changed for the worse. Along with that I have anxiety which I never had before, depression, and sometimes it feels like a panic attack. All of a sudden I will get this intense feeling of sadness and burst into tears, for NO REASON!  My memory is terrible now, I feel like I forget everything. After several break ups with my boyfriend he stayed with me but the mood swings are killing us. I just made my appointment to get it removed. I cant wait for the old me to be back!""",8
Phenelzine,Depression,"""I am currently taking 15 mg three x per day (total of 45mg). 

The first month was the worst. The main side effect that I had was body aches and muscle stiffness that never lessened. Once a month passed the body aches went away and I noticed a faint constant headache. After about a week that went away too. The only side effect I notice now (after 2 months on Nardil) is a pounding headache lasting 10 seconds and light headedness when I get up to stand from laying down and swelling. It give it 4/10 because it has made my suicidal thoughts disappear and I am less teary and emotional. Has not helped my overall mood or general sense of wellbeing. I find the dietary restrictions hard to follow.""",5
Adderall,ADHD,"""As a child I always had problems with being very hyper and I couldn&#039;t pay attention like other children in my class. My teacher noticed it and told my mother about things that could help me. My mother had me tested and put on Adderall. Within a week I can honestly remember a change. At first it made me feel very funny and zombie like but after it got in my system my family said I was totally different person. I also suffer with dyslexia, but this medication helped me with that too. I was put on it when I was 7 years old. When I was 20 I stopped taking it since I was out of school. I couldn&#039;t hold down a job and things just got really bad for me. Then I had my baby boy and decided I had to be put back on it. Best thing that happened to me.""",1
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""Have been on Buspar for a few months, and I like it a lot! It has made severe and paralyzing anxiety lift to a manageable level, even while taking a low dosage of 10 mg daily. My Dr. told me that I can increase the dosage, since in taking so little it doesn&#039;t rid me of anxiety completely (no med can). But I noticed that when I upped my dose my appetite came back more than I would have liked. Essentially, I think it works to strengthen my SSRI (sertraline); and I did have dizziness when I first started and felt pretty bad, but that&#039;s common for anti-anxieties and usually goes away as your body gets used to it. I do still find however after I take my morning dose (usually) with coffee I do feel a bit woozy but it usually wears off quickly.""",7
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""DO NOT GET DEPO-PROVERA INJECTION! I decided on this form of birth control to help my painful periods, and hopefully to make them go away completely. I liked how I wouldnt need to worry about taking a pill everyday.. But... about a week after I got my injection I started bleeding.. A LOT. It WAS NOT just &quot;spotting&quot;, it was a full on period. I thought, okay maybe I just need to get used to this new birth control. It has now been 4 months, and I am still bleeding. I saw my doctor to tell her about this crazy bleeding, about 3 months in from getting the injection, and at three months, you are supposed to get your next injection. Of course I did not get it again, but still continue to bleed. So please, do not get the depo shot! nightmare!""",8
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My daughter has been taking Aptensio for 3 months now. She takes 50mg once a day. She has taken just about every drug on the market. The longest lasting about 8 months. She takes the Aptensio at 7am and by 3:00 when she comes home she is a total train wreck! The come down for her is fast and has her acting worse than before medicated. She says she isn&#039;t really finding her focus to be much better when at school. However, in the past 3 months she has put on 5 lbs. She is always hungry which is a total change from any other stimulant med she has tried. I take the same med and have put on 13lbs. in three months. We know of two other children that have gained as well and love the med. So if your child is under weight from stimulants try this one""",1
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I have been taking the 3mg lunesta for 4 days now and still no sleep. The only plus side is my insurance would not pay for it and the generic 30 day was $128. My pharmacist called the manufacturer and got me 12 coupons for $100 off. Going to keep trying it for a few more nights, been reading up on it and it seems the worse the insomnia the longer it takes for it to work. I have gone weeks with no sleep my longest was 18 days of zero sleep the dark circles around my eyes were so dark I looked like a raccoon.""",0
Tramadol,Anxiety,"""Its hard to believe something like this can exist yet when you go to a doctor with cut up arms &amp; hearing voices, scared out of your mind, obsessed about an idea as irrational as the empty tight feeling in your chest they give you a box of antidepressants. I have always been socially awkward &amp; use to cry allot as a kid, the day dreamer who enjoyed being alone except I didn&#039;t like being alone. Tramadol gives me around 6 hours of bliss, 6 hours of clear thoughts of what is in-front of me, its amazing. a cure to unhappiness, its a shame its difficult to get, I have been on it for a year and a half, 1 50mg pill every 3 days gives me the motivation to wake up. """,7
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I had acne since I was younger but after having my son at 20 my acne went crazy big cystic acne along my jaw line I tried antibiotics creams all sorts of things but nothing worked and finally my dermatologist put me on Aldactone. I&#039;m on it 150 mg. I was on 200 mg first but I got a little nauseous at times nothing major so my doc lowered my dosage but this medicine has truly changed my life. My face glows I get maybe one pimple a month before I had 10 or more daily I&#039;m so glad I tried this because I was considering Accutane but this is awesome with little to no side effects for me.""",4
Adderall,ADHD,"""I have Primarily Inattentive ADHD and recently was diagnosed at 39 years old. I was on Amphetamine salts IR 10 mg 2x&#039;s a day as needed at 1st, which worked ok, but gave me some side effects I didn&#039;t appreciate, such as peeing so much it kept me awake at night. Also it worked inconsistently per day and sometimes per hour. It gave me blurred vision. So I was switched to 20 mg amphetamine salts xr which is much easier on my system. I don&#039;t have the urinary issues and it works a bit more consistently, though I don&#039;t get the &quot;zeroed in&quot; focus that I got with the IR and I still get some blurred vision, but no issues that cause it. Also, with both I have mildly decreased appetite, which is fine since I&#039;m overweight and also a very dry mouth.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""When I started accutane 5 months ago, I knew everything about it from blogs, reviews, forums, etc. However, nothing prepared me for my initial breakout. It was wretched and I basically looked like complete rubbish for 2 months. Despite this, I knew the effectiveness of accutane and was willing to take the bad breakout, drying skin and everything else that came with it. During accutane, my skin had ups and downs but now, by the fifth month, I have NO active acne. There is some discoloration from my initial breakout and that will probably take months to go away but I seriously cannot complain. If any of you are struggling with a severe initial breakout on accutane. STICK WITH IT and HANG IN THERE. It&#039;ll get better if you let it.""",4
Abilify,Depression,"""This medicine was prescribed to me as an add on with Zoloft. It did help my depression and anxiety... unfortunately I went from 118-122 lbs to 167 lbs.... and I didn&#039;t even weigh myself at my heaviest. I thought my thyroid was crapping out on me so I got that tested and it came back fine and then my Dr. was like.... one of the side effects of Abilify is weight gain. One of my friends who took it also gained a lot of weight as well... not to say if affects everyone this way but if you started taking it and are gaining weight like crazy with no end in site please talk to your doctor.""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""My experience with birth control in general is crappy. With depo and nexplanon I bled everyday for six months each, among many other side effects! They ruined my sex drive (so has Skyla). The IUD is my last shot.
I continued to bleed daily with no cramps for the first few months. My period are becoming more normal, but I&#039;m experiencing much worse cramping than my periods before it! The pain has left me unable to work, and it comes and goes like contractions in childbirth do. I have to do breathing exercises to get through it because painkillers like ibuprofen do nothing!
The pain is like when I had it inserted. I was warned I may have &quot;slight&quot; cramping, when I had severe cramping for 17 straight hours! It only stopped when I went to sleep.""",8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I was suffering from acne from class 10th to 3rd year of my bachelors degree. I am from India. Actually I had no hope of living full fledged life without acne.
I am so thankful to Accutane and people who worked on it to bring it into the market. I know you might be wondering about the negative effects. Trust me I was in such a situation that I didnt care if there were any negative effects or not for a medicine which could cure my acne. Such was my condition and this was my last resort. And believe me there were no side effects except dry lips which was manageable. People who are reading this, I am telling you that there is light at the end of the tunnel and this can be the best medicine. """,4
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Mirtazapine has been a life saver for me. I have had trouble falling asleep on and off over the last two and a half years mainly because I&#039;ve been unhappy at work. Just recently I was on zolpidem for 2 months and then switched to mirtazapine when I realised my sleep problems weren&#039;t going to get better in the short term. A couple of years ago things were so bad that sleeping tablets didn&#039;t even work and mirtazapine was the only medication that got me to sleep. I function normally after about the first 8 days on adjusting to this tablet - day 1 I feel like a zombie but by day 3 I start to feel less like that. Just stick with it for a few days and you will adjust, is my advice. The dosage I take is 30mg or 45mg.""",0
Ativan,Anxiety,"""I&#039;d been having problems with insomnia and anxiety, both conditions feeding off each other and making the other worse and creating mild depression. My GP prescribed 0.5mg to be taken at bed time as needed, to be increased to 1mg if needed (only gave me 14 tablets as they are habit forming). Amazing results! I slept through the night and woke feeling calm and NORMAL for the whole next day AND the day after! I&#039;ve taken 3 doses in the last 11 days, and took 1mg after a particularly stressful day with the same good results. No side effects of note except for a very mild headache 24 hours after the first dose. 

I&#039;m expecting to have a decreased need for these after starting a new job in the next week but so happy to have them to get me through.""",7
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been taking this for just 8 days and it WORKS.

I am 5&#039;8 and weighed 79.3 kilos at my height.. when I weighed myself day before yesterday I weighed 77.2 

These pills work because they FORCE the fat out of you and if you eat bad food they don&#039;t care where you are or what you&#039;re doing at that second... you WILL sh** yourself!

I have a Fitbit and have been making myself walk back from work 25 mins each day so together with normal days walking also average 5-6 miles. 

So lost over 2 kilos without a lot of effort in just over a week.

These really work. I&#039;ll be buying some more until the beer belly that haunted my late twenties is slayed and I can see my abs again!  :-)""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m a 26 year old female and I started taking this medicine along with a fluid pill on 01/25/08. At my heaviest weighing 317 lbs, I tried everything under the sun and lost maybe 10 lbs maximum here and there, but it always came right back. When I began this medication I weighed 308 lbs. Its 07/16/08 I weigh 218 lbs. That&#039;s a 90 lb loss from the date I started and 99 lbs since my heaviest. I do excerise for around an hour several times a week. I eat almost anything I want just in small portions. I cry when I look in a mirror.""",3
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the Mirena inserted 7 weeks after giving birth back in 2011. The initial process was okay, there was a little bit of cramping, but nothing major I took two Advil and the pain was gone. The Mirena itself was great, I had no issues or side effects, after the first two months I no longer got a period, but I would still experience the cramps and breast soreness. I recently got my Mirena removed because we could not locate the strings, after having an ultrasound done, we saw that the Mirena was exactly where it was supposed to be, although that was good news I decided to have it taken out. I would suggest it, no period, no side effects and you don&#039;t have to remember to take a pill daily. Its good for 5 years!""",8
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I have been taking 50mg Pristiq for depression for 4 months and having used many different depressant medicines previously  (Zoloft, Luvox, Lexapro, Cymbalta, Effexor)- I find it to have less side effects.  I take thyroid medication (Oroxine) as well and I feel like Pristiq helps it to work better.  I have lost 10kg in four months without dieting and just a tad more exercise.  Less headaches, less backaches and aches and pains, a bit more get up and go which I need as I have 3 kids.  I&#039;m hoping that it doesn&#039;t wear off as some of the antidepressants have in the past.  It is not as &#039;strong&#039; as when I first started, but still effective in controlling mood swings and anger (and appetite).""",5
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I had the implanon about 7 years ago and had it taken out after only a year (not the 3 its allowed).  This was a horrible experience for me. I didn&#039;t have a period he entire time, I gained almost 50 lbs, had the worst mood swings, I could feel myself becoming angry/crazy even though often times it was not that serious. Everything made me mad, or made me cry-- just horrible. after having it removed, it took almost 2 and a half years to start my period again and another 2 for it to become regular! when I did first get it, I had a period every 4-5 months. Now that it is a bit regular, I still can not seem to get pregnant. worst decision I ever made was getting the implanon. NEVER AGAIN, nor do I recommend to anyone""",8
Cymbalta,Depression,"""Tried most antidepressants, and I was ready to give up. I was tired of trying antidepressants, getting sick while I waited for the positives, only to find out it didn&#039;t really help.  I&#039;ve tried Prozac, Paxil (good but stopped working for me), Zoloft (allergic to it), Effexor, Citalopram (worst of all).  I don&#039;t know what made me ask my doctor for Cymbalta, but I did. It started working the second day I took it!  I have been slowly recovering from depression and getting my life back.  I hope the same for the people who read this.  Never give up hope!""",5
Saxenda,Obesity,"""For the first time in my life I feel normal. Dec 2011 I has gastric sleeve surgery. (Due to pcos and being pre diabetic ) Going in I weighed 352. I lost nearly 100#s. Over the past few years I&#039;ve gained 70 back. I work on the road and had no willpower when it came to coworkers stopping for fast food. Saying no is easy now. I&#039;m unsure how much I&#039;ve lost as my scale is broke, but I&#039;m back in my &quot;skinny jeans&quot; (snug but I couldn&#039;t come close to clasping them prior to saxenda. I pretty much force every meal down, and actually have to count calories to ensure I&#039;m getting enough! My main side effect has been nausea. Eatting a few bites feeling like I ate a buffet.""",2
Kyleena,Birth Control,"""I had a rough start with this IUD, but I have no kids, a small figure, and had been on the pill for 5 years. I was given a cervix softener and 800 mg ibuprofen, but I really don&#039;t think they helped me. Insertion was very painful and I almost passed out. I had to lay at the doctors office for a little over an hour to recover before driving home. I was still in a lot of pain and my doctor was nice enough to give me a muscle relaxer. A lot of pain and nausea the first two days and then that subsided. I spotted consistently for 3 weeks and have had occasional spotting since then, but no periods. I do have increased acne, but I expected that when going off the pill. Not needing to worry about birth control for the next five years is amazing.""",8
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""Very effective but bad side effects. I&#039;m 17 and I&#039;ve had two doses of it but I won&#039;t be continuing it. I have gained weight that is IMPOSSIBLE to lose, I get head rushes and I feel dizzy almost every time I stand up and lots of cramping. I stopped getting my period but one every month-two months I have a few drops of blood but that&#039;s it. I&#039;m not happy with the shot but it was effective.""",8
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Used this for a month and did not lose any weight. I read some reviews and did not go through any of the symptoms I saw. I gave it 2 stars because aI did notice it suppressed my appetite a little. I refilled and gave it another shot but the next month was more of the same. Went off it a few days, maybe a week, and this morning I took one......... Holy crap I feel like an ice cube. Never been this cold in my life and also been in the bathroom all day with #2 imitating a faucet. I can honestly say, soon as I get out this bed, rest of them are going in the trash. Worst $190 (2 months with discount card) I have ever spent on a weightloss gimmick. Now back to the meal plan and lots of exercise.""",3
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was put on Depakote ER and Celexa for depression and anxiety.  My mood and depression were helped and it knocked out my migraine headaches completely.  I experienced so many horrible side effects though. I gained 50 pounds in the six months I was on this, I lost my hair, I developed tremors that have not completely subsided, I had horrible stomach problems, heartburn, it made me extremely lethargic, libido was gone. This was just my experience with Depakote and if it weren&#039;t for all of the side effects I would have stayed on this medication.  Hope this helps.""",6
Accutane,Acne,"""I was on Accutane when I was 16 for about 8 months. I first took 40 mg a day then he moved it to 80. The only negative side effect I had was dry lips. My doctor kept me on it longer because I have extremely sensitive skin and can&#039;t use topical things like benzoyl peroxide because it makes my break out in skin rashes.  I have had clear skin up until about six months ago. I am 24 so that&#039;s 7 yrs of clear skin. I am going back to my dermatologist this week so hopefully he will put me back on it because it is amazing. I would seriously stay on it forever if I could.""",4
Ambien,Insomnia,"""Take it on an empty stomach, or it won&#039;t work. I have terrible insomnia and have been on it long-term. It still works after 15 years. It had some initial side effects, but they went away after a few months. It works very well, but I gave it eight stars only because you have to take on an empty stomach. If I eat a late dinner, I can count on it not working. Otherwise, it&#039;s the only medication that has helped me sleep. I take 15-20 mg per night.""",0
Sronyx,Birth Control,"""I had never taken any type of birth control until I met my fiancee. I was on Implanon for almost 11 months and I hated it! I had all the side effects that came with it, plus my period for all those months non-stop and to say I almost ruined my relationship and to top it off I got an infection for using tampoms all the time. Anyway today is my 5 day taking Sronyx and I already feel great no side effects what so ever. I&#039;m happy again without any mood swings. I really recommend this pill.""",8
Focalin,ADHD,"""My 10-year son has ADHD (combined) and ODD. Focalin XR so far is the only medication that works on my son&#039;s inattentiveness. However, on 15 mg he was very moody and glassy eyed. Found out later that he was overmedicated. What I didn&#039;t like about Focalin was that he became very quiet almost Zombie like. Also, the medication did not last in his system long enough. He stopped takes Focalin XR over a year now and has been on Vyvanse (70mg.) I am considering putting him back on Focalin with a lower dose.""",1
Accutane,Acne,"""I had acne towards the end of middle school going into high school and by my sophomore year it was really a full blown problem. My cheeks and my forehead and almost every part of my face was covered in acne. After trying antibiotics and creams for 2 years I was recommended Accutane. The first 4 months I did not see that much in results but when the 5th month hit it was intense. My face cleared up right away and I look like a completely different person! It was amazing. There were downsides though, the depression that it causes is real. I have been off the medication now for 3 1/2 years with my skin still looking great.""",4
Spironolactone,Acne,"""Spironolactone cured my acne! I started getting pretty severe acne this year and after trying minocycline and doxycycline which did not work for me, my dermatologist recommended spironolactone. After just 3 weeks, my acne started to calm down and I am currently nearing my 2nd month of spironolactone and my face is acne free. Although I have oily skin, spironolactone really dried up my face and lips so I have to moisturize constantly throughout the day. This medicine took some time to see drastic improvements but it is definitely worth the try!""",4
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Diag: Bipolar 2 with predominant depression, plus panic disorder. I have been taking a very low starter dose (25mg) of Lamictal for about 3 weeks. I&#039;m due to up the dose to 50mg now. Aside from my anti-panic emergency medicine and proprananol for blood pressure, I&#039;ve never &quot;upped&quot; a dose of anything. I typically give up on a medicine for one reason or another (not effective, negative side effects, complicated dosing, cost, etc). Lamictal is a prescription that I intend to up my dose to 50mg though, and will do so gladly. People have commented on a more calm &amp; &quot;mellow&quot; mood, a greater tolerance to stress and irritations, and being more pleasant to others. I&#039;m on a slightly more even keel now &amp; look forward to seeing what&#039;s next with increased dose""",6
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My 4 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD and we began the journey to find what would help.  We have tried many medications but due to his young age and small size it was hard to find anything that did not come with bad side effects. We tried Metadate 10 mg and he did REALLY well during the day but at 2 it would wear off and we were in for a rough night, the doctor tried Methylin 5 mg, but that just kept him up all night, so we started giving 10 mg of Metadate in the A.M. and a 2nd dose of 10mg at noon. It was like finding the holy grail of medicine. My son is now a funny, loving, calm little boy who the entire family (including our poor dog) loves to be around.""",1
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am currently on 50mg of Seroquel in addition to other meds. It has certainly made a huge positive difference in my paranoid thinking and obsessive-compulsive spartanism. It has leveled out my wild swings between anxiety and depression somewhat. It works great on my insomnia too. It causes me constipation and aggravates my essential tremor, but its benefits are well worth the price. I have not yet experienced the increase in appetite it&#039;s known for.""",6
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been pretty healthy most of my life, had twins natural, torn acl in knee, then after my twins I had my gall bladder out 21 years ago. I am 47 years old and very active. I tried diets here and there but when I had to get total hysterectomy a couple of years ago I just could not stop the weight coming on me. I was so up set at 200 lbs.  It was the final straw I went to my doctor and she put me on phinermen for 6 months I lost 20 lbs but hit a plateau. So she said I should lost more that that!? Well then she prescribed Belviq and I&#039;ve been on it 2 weeks. I only took 1 a day to see how it made me feel then now on 2 a day like prescription. I loosing weight again. Not tons but I feel great. I recommend this to anyone who is need to get thin""",2
Sertraline,Depression,"""Took Zoloft for depression and anxiety and was on it for about six months. It absolutely helped and I felt less anxious almost immediately. But I stopped taking it due to increasing negative side effects. I have learned through my journey that other people&#039;s experiences of these kinds of meds are no real indication of how it will be for you personally. But sometimes it helps to share. Just take everything with a grain of salt. 
Zoloft negatives: constant yawning, first three days you feel so unwell you think you&#039;ll never be ok again.  Also, inability to have an orgasm, which lasted about three months and then I was fine. Serious vertigo that got so bad I had to stop taking it. 
Tried venlafaxine and Prozac with better results.""",5
Bupropion,Bipolar Disorde,"""When I had a dlifficult time getting a refill due to insurance issues, I missed a few days and talked to my doctor about trying to go without. I take Xanax ER  2mg and Lamictal 200mg both twice daily. I was fine for about 2 weeks. When I spiraled downward, it was bad. I ate, slept, and cried. I never missed a day of work, but I sure felt like running out of there. Finally, things worked out with insurance. I am actually glad to take a 3rd medication realizing how it helped me. It has been about 6 weeks since I took my last dose. I begin again tomorrow. So, my story can be summarized as depression and frustration levels returned within 2 weeks of stopping bupropion XL 300mg.  Don&#039;t just stop!""",6
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Currently on Lithicarb 500mg taken as 2 x 250mg tablets taken 1 morning and one night. Was bumped up to 750mg but reduced back after severe dry skin and digestive discomfort as side effects. 
Was finally put on lithium after previously being misdiagnosed with just depression and general anxiety &amp; put on Venlafaxine which exacerbated my mania...hence was finally correctly diagnosed with bipolar. 
Suicidal thoughts are now minimal and I got over the need to pee excessively which comes with increasing your fluid intake after first starting my meds. Now I am 4 months in &amp; I have gained weight but that doesn&#039;t bother me as much as my loss of creativity &amp; general lack of motivation. On the plus side, this doesn&#039;t bother me as much as it should.""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started Contrave almost one week ago. Weight loss has been about four pounds, but the thing I&#039;m most thankful for is the reduction in the desire to eat. I had several parties to attend this past weekend and previously would have spent a lot of time in my head debating the wine and junk food before ultimately caving in. This time, it wasn&#039;t a hard decision. I didn&#039;t even want any of it. I can&#039;t tell you how relieved I feel not to have every potential meal or snack be a mental battle anymore. That alone is worth it, no matter the weight loss! Side effects have been decreased appetite and some lethargy.""",2
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""Was prescribed gabapentin for general anxiety and also to help deal with an exceptionally stressful living situation.  Only take 600 mg. later in the day and most definitely am able to comfortably relax in a way I wasn&#039;t always able to. Did notice kind of a &quot;swimmy&quot; spaced out feeling and not always able to keep an even keel while walking.  But I&#039;m willing to accept that because I greatly appreciate the peace of mind it affords me.""",0
Monodox,Acne,"""Unfortunately. This Medication really took a turn for the worse on my acne. I was on it for only 7 weeks but I couldn&#039;t handle getting nauseous and bad acne anymore. It made my skin more red and I was taking it with Acanya the topical cream. My skin just wasn&#039;t accepting the antibiotic which was sad because it had such great reviews. If you are taking it, take it with food. I missed one meal and needed to take it and I was sick for hours and ever since every time I took it, I would get even more nauseous. You win some, you lose some.""",4
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I give this only a 5 out of 10 because although it helped stabilize my moods very well (I was NEVER angry or sad), it made me a zombie. Before I was on it, I was a video gamer and read all the time. I had to drop out of school and take a break from my job because I couldn&#039;t concentrate and couldn&#039;t focus on reading. I found no pleasure in video games anymore. Luckily I&#039;ve been off it for awhile and am back to my old self. I can finally concentrate and feel emotions, not like I&#039;m just too tranquilized to care. Side effects I experienced were also extreme restlessness after dosage, sleepiness during the say, and insomnia at night. Luckily there was no weight gain though.""",6
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve had a severe manic episode and was put on antipsychotics which helped calming me down but I was still a bit manic. When put on lithium I felt a lot better because mania ceased. The difference between antipsychotics and litihium for me was like if antipsychotics stepped on the brake and lithium lifted the gas pedal. 

The only, but still significant, side effect I&#039;ve had is less short term memory.

Lithium stabilize my mood, less anxiety and stress (less diarrhea, less neck pain, more relaxed), better sleep not just because mania stopped but also because overall well being

I&#039;m very satisfied with lithium as a mood stabilizer""",6
Yasmin,Acne,"""i used this as a treatment for my acne and pms symptoms. i dont believe it! this medicine is a miracle! my acne is completely gone!

Sertraline,Depression,"""Been taking 25mg zoloft for 2 weeks. Due to non stop over thinking, paranoia and constant checking up on suspected cheating partner. This drug has enabled me to think clearly again and be able to end an unhappy relationship that I could not end before. I don&#039;t react or panic at the thought of being on my own anymore. Its great to feel balanced and even keeled with my thoughts. No real side effects, although I am more motivated at home and don&#039;t seem to have a huge appetite so lost some weight. I like this drug, its given me some sanity again however I am worried about the symptoms returning if I stop taking it.""",5
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am currently on 50mg of Seroquel in addition to other meds. It has certainly made a huge positive difference in my paranoid thinking and obsessive-compulsive spartanism.

Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hello everyone, I am going to review this medication from 6 years ago because it was the first &amp; only time I had taken it &amp; just got prescribed again today. I had blown out my right knee in 2010 bad enough to be out of work for 7 months working as a corrections officer. I weighed in pre op at 363. I am 6&#039;4&quot; tall &amp; in 4 months I lost 70+ lbs. went from 363 to 286lbs from Nov. 2010 to March 2010. In that time I injured my back had to dart pain meds &amp; the pain was so bad that I could no longer exercise. All I did was go to work &amp; come home &amp; lay In bed. From 2010 to today I now weigh 449. After a long battle of immobility &amp; depression along with pain meds, I have now made my mind up to grit my teeth and make another change. This med works.""",3
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I was only on Nucynta for 2 days.  50 mg tabs x 3 times a day. I have been taking tramadol with no problems, but thought this might work better, as tramadol does not always control my pain.

I must be very sensitive, as this medicine on day 1 made me feel as if my body were speeding, but tired and loopy at the same time. 
Day 2 was more of the same, but I needed a higher dose in order to control a pain level of 7 that comes upon me as the day wears on.  I decided I did not want to go to 100mg because of my sensitivity to this medicine.""",9
Paxil,Anxiety,"""I was suffering from awful situational anxiety and depression, hard time fully functioning, couldn&#039;t eat, sleep, focus, cried every day, was an emotional mess. Dr put me on 20mg Paxil and told me it would take 4-6 weeks to take effect. Within a week I felt so much better. I could eat, sleep, stopped crying altogether, and stopped being constantly overly emotional.

I did sometimes have a difficult time fully accessing emotions, gained too much weight, and am having trouble with motivation so I&#039;m currently on day 4 of weaning myself off, nothing but mild side effects so far. For me Paxil was extremely helpful to get me through a very difficult time and get me back to functioning so I could keep my job and parent my children.""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I am an 18 year old girl who has had acne since the fourth grade. I have been on countless medications to try and help my skin; Tetracycline, Minocycline, Doxycycline, and Ortho Tri-Cyclen (birth control). None of these helped. I have used Proactive (twice) that didn&#039;t help in the least bit, so my last resort was Accutane. I was very nervous about it, having done my research on it, I wasn&#039;t sure if I wanted to. Well, let me tell you, I am so glad I did. I am only on my second month, and my skin is so smooth. Before, I had cysts and nodules all along my jaw, my neck, my chest, my upper back, and my cheeks. Now, they&#039;re flat and fading. I don&#039;t have any on my face, my chest is now drying out, and my neck looks better. """,4
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I have been taking temazepam off and on for years. Tried Ambien too. Ambien knocks me out right away, but I can only sleep for about 4 hours on it. Temazepam takes a little longer maybe an hour and I need to stay relaxed. Makes me feel a little dopey, but I sleep all night. No ill effects the next day. No rebound effects the next day. Only take twice a week at most for best results. Take a couple of months vacation from it every few months.""",0
Belviq,Obesity,"""Belviq is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I stalked the web for a month before I tried it looking for the most detailed reviews, to ease my mind, so I&#039;m here to provide one. Been on Belviq 1 1/2 weeks- down TEN POUNDS. How?!  you ask? No more cravings. When I want sweets? I turn to fruit. When I want salty? Cucumbers with a bit of salt. Usually a cup of food and I&#039;m full, pushing the plate away. I keep to about 1,000 calories a day now, which is so easy to stay within, because I&#039;m hardly ever hungry. No real side effects, felt a little dizzy first two days, but it passed quickly. Vivid weird dreams every night though! But I sleep like a rock.       BP and heart rate are down, and I have more energy. Go Belviq!""",2
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I read all of the reviews which scared me. I even had one of my friends tell me that she went mental on the medication and to not do it. Likewise my beautician also warned me of the side effects saying she felt 10
X older and your skin should be very bad before considering it. I decided to start regardless of the reviews on the basis that I could stop if it all got too much.  
I am 29 had perfect skin all of my teenage life and gradually into my 20s I was getting huge cystic acne on my chin and cheeks. When one went away and scarred another would form and so the vicious cycle continued. 
I have had very minimum side effects! Dry lips but seriously not bad at all. Do not believe the reviews! Go on it it will
Change your life !!""",4
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I started tretinoin .05% 6 weeks ago every other night. I applied right after washing my face. Big mistake. Very red with lots of peeling. My second mistake was to rub the skin off when it was softened in the shower. While skin felt smooth instantly, there was painful stinging the minute I tried to moisturize. I had to wash off. Since then I&#039;ve started waiting 30min before applying and I definitely don&#039;t rub it off in the shower. I&#039;m still just at twice a week and having dry flaky skin within two days of applying-makeup looks awful. So I went to a derm who is also the owner of a med spa. She explained diff between hydration vs  moisturizers and put me on hydration serums. So much better!""",4
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I stopped sleeping totally at some point in my life and after a lot of struggle my doctor put me on amitriptyline. I hated the thought of being on a psychotic drug but with my body clearly denying me sleep, I had no choice. 

Amitriptyline felt like a miracle. My first night, I slept a deep volume of dreamless sleep. My eyes wouldn&#039;t even open. Aside from having a dry mouth and having a really irritating taste in my mouth, it was perfect. 

Four years down the line, I am still on amitriptyline. The 50mg dosage works well for me.  I have increased dosage and reduced it over the years but 50mg has remained my regular dose""",0
Bupropion,Depression,"""I am a mother of 2 small children and I began this medication about 2 months ago after being on Celexa (which made me feel tired a lot and hungry all the time - I gained like 20 lbs on it).  The first thing I noticed with Wellbutrin was a decreased appetite.  Then I started to feel more alert - the same kind of alertness you would feel when taking Adderall.  A few weeks into it, my mood was totally different.  I was happy, calm, energetic - all the things that I wanted for so long, but never thought I could achieve, as I was very depressed.  I was walking in a parking lot the other day and I thought to  myself &quot;wow.  isn&#039;t life great?&quot; - Wellbutrin is an AMAZING medication.""",5
Methylin,ADHD,"""This drug has changed my life. I have ADD and depression. I used to not be able to get out of bed for a week at a time. Now I&#039;m loving life hanging out with friends and happy for the first time in a long time. I&#039;ve tried a few other ADD medicines they didn&#039;t really help me. I like the Methyln generic much more than any of them.  The only problem I have with it is that I don&#039;t like to stop taking it and go to bed, kinda like addicted to it while on it, but ONLY when I&#039;m on it. Before I could go all day and not crave it, been on it a year now. It&#039;s just when I take my first one hard for me to not want to stay on it because I enjoy life so much more.""",1
Methadone,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had chronic pain as a result of a coiling embolization in my brain.I was tried on so many different pain meds I thought about throwing in the towel...the cure was worse than the pain at times.Thankfully,my doctor suggested methadone.I&#039;ve used this medication for over 5 yrs now with no complications other than having to increase it yearly to accomidate the tolerance effect.I also like it because it is inexpensive and doesn&#039;t leave me feeling high or goofy.""",9
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have been on Trazodone for 3 years now in 300mg tabs from the very start. It makes me nauseated but am unable to do to a hernia repair that was done.  Also suffer from dry mouth.  The medication has worked great from some time.  I find it better to take it without food because it starts working within a hour.  If you take it with a meal or a light snack it takes about 2 hours to start working. So depending on when you take it may cause some the that groggy feeling in the morning.  Recently I have notice it doesn&#039;t have the same effect on me. Now I have nights I can&#039;t sleep.  """,0
Pristiq,Depression,"""I thought I could manage without medication but after 2 months I fell into the black hole yet again. This time my Doctor put me on Pristiq and it gave me an unexpected benefit.   A few years ago I had a right hip replacement but it kept pulling out and I would fall down. It then dislocated altogether and I had to have another operation and after a year it dislocated again. This year Jan 2017 I had my other hip replaced.  Not surprisingly the fear of falling was extreme.  After 4 weeks on Pristiq I found I can walk without aids. I would like Pristiq to help stop the negative thoughts that roll around my head however I will stay on Pristiq regardless because it is the difference in being able to walk or be incapacitated by fear and anxiety.""",5
Clindamycin,Acne,"""My dermatologist put me on the topical solution of clindamycin phosphate for acne in early June along with adapaline gel which I had been using for a few months before. After a couple of weeks the clindamycin made my skin completely clear it was amazing! Since then it has kept my skin pretty clear, but my one major complaint is that it had made my skin incredibly red and oily constantly. I have tried the get off of the solution because of how bad it became but the redness and oilyness now won&#039;t go away and getting off of the solution only made me break out as well. Besides that it&#039;s great, but beware of the side effects that may arise after a couple of months!""",4
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I start my fourth week of Contrave tomorrow. The 4 a day week. So far I&#039;ve only lost 4-5 pounds, but I&#039;ve lost 3 inches in my waist, 1 inch in my hips and chest. Pounds a good but inches are great! As far as side effects go, constipation and mild head/neck ache since starting two in the morning. Starting weight 169 at 5&#039;3 and 33 years old. My doctor gave me a discount card for this since insurance didn&#039;t cover it. Would&#039;ve been $245 a month now only $90.""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started Phentermine 37.5 on 5/27/15. I did cut my intake tremendously thanks to the phentermine. I will be honest my physical activity could have been a lot more I worked out only periodically(hardly ever). As of 6/25/15 I had lost 13lbs. I started at 302 5&#039;8 now I&#039;m 289. This has really motivated me to work harder during the second month of my prescription. If these pills could help me lose 13 lbs with hardly any physical activity what could they do if I got off my butt! Feeling really excited and optimistic.""",2
Lidoderm,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had numerous invasive spinal surgeries, sciatic nerve pain, as well as discomfort at the site of my neurostimulator implantation. The patches alleviate the discomfort in conjunction with a medication regime put in place by my pain management doctor that I follow to the letter allowing for less medication having to be taken while they&#039;re in use. I&#039;ve had no side effects. Overall a very positive experience.""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""This drug is magical - a cure all! I&#039;m 25 and have dealt with acne of varying degrees since I was 11 (trying pretty much every medication/scrub/wash/cream/etc out there) and for the first time in my life after 7 months of treatment I no longer experience breakouts and can genuinely feel good about myself without wearing makeup in public. I experienced zero negative side-effects and strongly recommend!""",4
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I have tried numerous sleep aids, from natural, over the counter,  to prescribed, and this one by far works the best for me. I was prescribed 25mg to take at bed. It does help me fall asleep a little faster, because it helps my brain &quot;shut off&quot;, and it definitely helps me sleep better. I still wake up through out the night, but not as much, and falling back asleep is a lot easier. It does make me feel slightly groggy in the morning, and I am having slight dry mouth. The benefit outweighs the side effects for sure. I&#039;ve tried Trazodone, and that didn&#039;t help at all, and experienced the rare side effect of painful erection...that was awful.""",0
Adderall,ADHD,"""I was once a procrastinating, underemployed, muscular 18 year old who was unsure of his future. My ADHD made it impossible to focus, my motivation was terrible, and I snapped on anyone over the smallest thing. I knew about Ritalin...also knew its excess side effects. Heard about Adderall and decided maybe I should speak with my PCF. He prescribed me Adderal, a pill that can either make or break you. If you have had ANY history of drug abuse AVOID IT. It took me a month to realize I was abusing it. I lost sleep, weight, gained a tolerance. When I decided I&#039;d better let my wife handle my medication, she gave me my  two IRs per day and still does. It helped alot. The medication is wonderful for ADHD but can very easily kill you if you abuse it""",1
Tramadol,Depression,"""After hurting my back, hips and developing sciatica from lifting people in hospitals/nursing homes/rehab/homecare, I was given Ultram for the excruciating pain.  It worked wonderfully without the dopiness associated with narcotics.  I had also suffered from depression since I was a child and had been through numerous meds that didn&#039;t work, or made my life even worse.  Tramadol is the only med that I have taken that has successfully treated both my chronic pain as well as my depression, allowing the sun to shine in my life.""",5
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I am 16 years old and I suffered from acne since I was about 12. I have a very special type of acne. Its very tiny and form in clusters and never come to a head. I had this all over my forehead and cheeks. They would look worse under some lighting and looked awful under makeup. They gave my skin a sandpaper feel. I also got the occasional pimple. I was prescribed this medication by my doctor . I was given a 0.05 tretinoion. My first month was awful. I got the purging and all the pimples were coming to a head. After a couple of weeks my skin was starting to become smooth and healthy! Don&#039;t give up on this drug! One recommendation is to keep it up! Don&#039;t stop!!""",4
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I am 5&#039;8&quot; and have never had weight issues up until this last year.  No matter how little I ate or how much exercise I completed my weight continued to climb.  Hitting 181 lbs my doctor agreed to put me on Saxenda injections.  I started 6/8/16 experiencing slight nausea (especially if I eat bread or drink alcohol).  Needless to say I am steering away from bread, pretzels,  etc...  As of today I am down 5 lbs and very excited to see what the future holds.  This is the first time my weight has moved in the right direction :) I have maintained my workout regimen of three times a week boot camps and daily 30 mins plus of walking my dogs, etc.  I recommend Saxenda to anyone that is in a &quot;slump&quot; and is ready to take control of their weight.""",3
Topiramate,Obesity,"""Awful.  I lost 10 pounds in 5 weeks before I had to quit Topamax due to side effects, which were terrible.  They included:  memory loss and &quot;senior moments&quot; which increased 10-fold, I think this medicine dropped my IQ at least 15 points, that &quot;I&#039;m not part of this world&quot; feeling of disconnectedness; and overheating to the point that I simply could not work out.

Gained the 10 pounds back within 3 weeks of quitting.""",2
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Been on Trazadone for 2 months for insomnia and traumatic nightmares associated with PTSD and depression.
Helps me somewhat in falling asleep, but I still can&#039;t stay asleep. Wake up repeatedly during the night with awful nightmares. When I wake up the next morning (11 hours after taking 50mg) I am unsteady on my feet, sometimes fall. Exhausted all day. Feeling more depressed and despairing (also taking fluoxetine 40mg).""",0
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I started on Belviq 2 weeks ago and I am down 26 lbs.  I started at 383 and am down to 357.  I assume much of my wt loss (20 lbs) the first week was water wt as I was eating fast food every day.  I also am using my fitness pal to help count my calories.  I have also begun to walk as a form of excercise.   After going out to eat this past weekend for a celebration I brought home 1/2 my meal which I have never done in my entire life.  I have lost wt on my own in the past, but felt due to depression and being in a hole I needed some help this time.  I also am only taking one 10 mg pill a day instead of the 10 mg 2x daily.  I am not hungry and the pills are expensive so if one pill a day is working this is what I will continue on.""",2
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m on day 6, @20 mg.  I&#039;ve been waiting for this feeling for a long time.  I have energy, no brain fog, I don&#039;t feel like isolating myself, most of all I feel happy.  I&#039;m having weird dreams but I can take that.  I&#039;m not sitting on my assets for days without showering bc it was so laboring just to think much less move.  I don&#039;t ache in the way I have been for nearly 8 years.  I also feel like there&#039;s an open communication between my brain &amp; body now...before  I had great ideas of things to do but my body wasn&#039;t receiving the message.  I can think and remember things now. I got to a point where my head was so tired I had to keep my eyes closed and it&#039;s gone now.  This is going to change my life...that&#039;s amazing.  I can&#039;t wait!""",6
Victoza,Obesity,"""I have been on Victoza since Jan 9th. I am impressed with how well things are going. I was diagnosed as insulin resistant and am overweight and would like to lose 70 lbs. I have lost 20 lbs so far. I modified my diet and faithfully use a fit bit daily to log my activity, diet and glucose levels. I am staying on a 0.6 dose and am happy to say my glucose levels are ranging between 85 and 105. I had one day of nausea.""",2
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features, I got off of risperdal that I was only on for a couple of weeks and immediately started saphris. I&#039;m an artist, and when I&#039;m manic I create a lot. Within an hour in my first night of taking Saphris, I began to see colors very brightly , euphoria, &quot;hey dad I feel REALLY good.&quot; Then I drew up 12 doodles in under 30 minutes. That night I could not sleep well and began to hear laughing in my room. I was verrrrry manic. When I woke up the next day I worked out at the gym for 3 hours and then went to the park to walk a lap. When I looked in the sky I was seeing UFOs and wondering if they were communicating with me. (hallucinations)
That night I was having more auditory hallucinations before bed.""",6
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was put on Seroquel for severe anxiety and suspected bipolar.  Let me begin with this.  Do not EVER TAKE THIS IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA.  You know that horrible drying effect that many antihistamines have resulting in asthma attacks?  This is much worse.  I started out with an 8th of a tablet (12.5mg).  This gave me a calm,  sleepy feeling that would put me to sleep for bed and would last until roughly 5pm the next day.  But when I upped the dose to 37.2mg I had a really bad asthma attack, heart pounding and my ears rang which lasted 2 weeks after I discontinued the med.  Not a pleasant experience for someone with severe anxiety.  Be very cautious.  Up the dosage more slowly than the MD recommends. I was to start 50mg/night""",6
Orlistat,Obesity,"""Just over 4 weeks ago I started taking Xenical that my doctor prescribed me. On the day of started I was 23 stone 13 lbs, I am now 22 stone 5lbs, so I have lost 21lbs in just over 4 weeks! I was sensible enough to read online reviews and decided to make sure I eat as less fat as possible. When I&#039;m hungry at lunch I occasionally had a egg and bacon sandwich but cooked in no fat and using fry lite spray, cut the fat off the meat. I have a sensible normal dinner and breakfast sometimes toast with no butter with a banana inside or a couple slices ham. I have cut out all the junk. Side effects for the first few days slight tummy cramp and very occasionally a looser stool when going to the toilet, but no other side effects at all.""",2
Concerta,ADHD,"""Concerta makes you focused and and concentrated. If you wanna get stuff done you can get it done in a breeze. You won&rsquo;t notice that your enjoying what your doing, what I mean by that is like u know how homework is boring and especially if you have ADHD you have impulse problems, when you take concerta it&rsquo;s like when your doing it, time passes by a lot and you won&rsquo;t notice. Like you look at the time and for example it&rsquo;s 2:30 while your doing your homework like I said the time will be 4:00 when you look back at your phone""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started using phentermine 7/17/10. My starting weight was 235lbs. It took me a year to get to 235 from 248. I find that ridiculous... a year to lose 13 pounds. So as of today (wk 5) I am down to 216lbs. I love having to remind myself to eat instead of eating just because I feel like it or out of boredom. I do cardio for 35 min 5 days/week plus warm up/cool down walk for 10 min. I have a 1300 calorie per day limit but I stay well below due to having no appetite.""",3
Kadian,Pain,"""I was in a car wreck about 2.5 years ago, which broke the Harrington rods I had in my back for scoliosis since the age of 15. I am now 28 and feel like I am 80! I have been on Tylenol 3s &amp; 4s, Vicodin 10mg, Oxycodone 15mg, and then Kadian finally helped me. I have been on the Kadian 30mg twice a day for about 9 or 10 months. It gave me hope, although it does take a couple weeks to start to really kick in. No high feeling, and really takes the base pain away. Soon I will have the rod taken out and that probably wont help the C2,3,4 in my neck and the L5 and S1 discs that are smashed and pushing into my spinal cord. But I can give my 5 year old a bath, walk the dog, etc. It is about $383 per month insurance covering the cost! Saved my life!""",9
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I have been on Effexor XR 75mg for two months now, after previously being on Zoloft and Celexa. The two other medications were not effective for my anxiety and depression, and they tended to make me either tired or foggy regardless of the time of day that I took them. I expected the tiredness to wear off, but the foggy feeling never did. My doctor prescribed Effexor XR, and it has been very effective for both my depression and anxiety symptoms. I am not 100% perfect, and I still have anxiety, but in the appropriate moments. The moments of unreasonable anxiety attacks are fewer and far between since starting the medicine. I had no negative side effects, and I take it every morning at 9am.""",7
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""AS like so many others have posted, I too have had major depression,bi-polar disorder,and anxiety. I&#039;ve been on every med imaginable for these diagnoses and they all have stopped working. My current regimen is Cymbalta 90mg bid and Zyprexa 5mg @bedtime. I now have been taking gabapentin 400mg tid. (I&#039;m also a recovering opiate addict.) anyways, the gabapentin seems to give me a pleasant type of calmness. I am saying tons of prayers that this is the missing piece for me. I&#039;ll try ANYTHING to get my life back. ANYTHING""",7
Butrans,Pain,"""I was put on this medication by a new doctor who didn&#039;t like that I was on fentanyl patches.  I was put on the 10 mg to start.  The first couple of weeks everything was great, no pain.  But then I started having severe muscle and joint pain.  Since I have Lupus and Sjogrens I am used to joint pain but this was worse than normal.  I tried taking the patch off and the muscle aches stopped.. but the other pain I had was worse.  My doctor thinks I need to take a higher dose... so I tried the 20 mg.  Made me so sleepy I couldn&#039;t keep my eyes open.  I wonder if any other people have had the side effect of severe muscle aches. I wish I could find something to make it stop.""",9
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m a 33 year old male and have been on Lexapro for a little over a month now. The first day I felt like I drank tons of coffee..I felt good but wired. Then I felt tired all the time for the next following weeks. But for the past week or so I have been feeling awesome, more confident, talkative, happier but still very sleepy. It&#039;s great because I actually sleep the whole night but its so hard to wake up. I get to work late sometimes. I tried switching to taking it midday but by 7pm I&#039;m ready for bed. I&#039;m still happy and love it but the drowsiness and yawning are irritating because I want to do more with my evening.""",7
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""The first time I&#039;ve ever felt happy for real, no shadows, no zombiness. I have been on everything else, always just made me spacey or not care or short attention span. This drug is totally different. Slowly titrated from 2.5 to 15mg  and I seem stable now. It took a few months to get over initial nausea and lack of sleep, on and off sexual side effects. but now I feel totally normal and am enjoying life. I never thought I&#039;d say that and it sounds cheesy but its true, and it seriously works!""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started Adipex two days ago. I&#039;m 21 years old 5&#039; tall and weigh 158lbs. According to my BMI and my doctors visit I am at the breaking point of obesity. I have had many struggles in the past with getting back to my goal weight of 105-110 and decided to give Adipex a shot. Obesity runs in my family and I hope to stop the cycle. I haven&#039;t had any side effects so far except for occasional dry mouth so I just drink water which is good anyway. I have had a great experience so far with increased energy and a suppressed appetite. I want to keep up with at least exercising for 30min a day and eating better and hopefully I will see results at the end of month one. I want to be at my goal weight which is a loss of about 50lbs in around 8 months. Wish me luck!""",3
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I was placed on Sexenda about 16 months ago. Studies have shown that after 12 months that weight loss does not happen. That has proved true. I started at 212 lb and at 16 months was down to 179.   at my last appointment  I had a 5lb weight gain ( due to menstruation)  and my insurance company would not renew my prescription. There for the doctors said to go ahead and stop it completely. when I initially started this medication I was explained that you should not stop this suddenly and should be weaned off - I was at the max dose of 3mg daily.  It has been a month since I have last taken the medication and I have gained 10lbs back. I have not changed anything I was doing to previously. Just a warning toto after sexenda use and the discontinuing process.""",3
Lexapro,Depression,"""I have taken Lexapro for three months and never felt better after suffering a stroke at the age of 23 due to a birth defect in my brainstem.  I was switched to Celexa because my insurance does not cover Lexapro. I felt all the anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, not wanting to get off the couch return. I went back on Lexapro and will pay whatever the cost. The side effects, for me, are  weight gain. I gained 10 pounds despite running 6 to 12 miles a day. I crave bad, bad food, which I never used to care about. My sex drive is, well, gone. I have to work on it. I guess 10lbs, paying the monthly price at the pharmacy, and the side effects above are well worth my quality of life.""",5
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Concerta has made me more focused and things seem to be easier to understand for me. I am 36 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD. This is a wonderful medication and for me, life changing. I now know I needed this medication for many, many years now. And so far no side effects, sleep better and still have my appetite. I have more energy and I don&#039;t procrastinate anymore when I need to do something I just do it without procrastinating about it. Exercise is also easier, which is good because I am overweight and need to lose some weight. I seem to be able to interact with people a lot easier and now I can have a conversation with people without blurting out things before I forget what I want to say and having to pause in between sentences.""",1
Bupropion,Depression,"""For ME it was awful.  I was on this pill for 7 days.  I went to the doctor today because my heart was beating so fast on these pills and I was paranoid, anxious, shaking, and very very Bit**y.  I thought I was having a heart attack at work I was crying, it was awful. I went to the doctor and I couldn&#039;t get words out.  My pulse was 115 and blood pressure was high (never ever is) it just shot up. The doctor said I was having a panic attack and that it is due to the medication.  She took me off it and for the next 5 days I am on LORAZEPAM 0.5MG (sedative to calm me down - take it at night) and switching me back to sertaline.  This was the worst experience of my life.  I thought I was going to end up in the ER or dead.""",5
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I am a 22 year old female who had painful, cystic, lumps that would form deep in the skin around my mouth and would get worse with my hormone cycle. I went on YAZ as it is the only birth control proven to help hormonal acne and the progesterone in it, drosperinone, acts very similar to spiro. This helped but then school got very stressful and the acne got worse. I went on 50 mg of spiro and it definitely helped cut down on the number and severity of acne. After being on the 50 mg for 4 months, I moved up to 100 mg and have had 0 acne since!!! Not exaggerating. YAZ completely cleared my 21 year old friend&#039;s hormonal acne up but mine did not clear until adding 100 mg of spiro, so try things out to see what will help!""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I am 20 years old and have had the Nexplanon in my arm for 2 years.The insertion itself wasn&#039;t bad, just a little sting. I didn&#039;t have any bruising and the rod is still able to be felt in my arm.I first experienced a little acne and a little weight gain but nothing major. Now having the rod in my arm for 2 years, I have experienced major anxiety, depression, and mood swings.As most other young adults, working parttime and going to school parttime can cause a lot a stress on a person.. at first I thought it was normal and every other person was experiencing the same stress as me.. It kept getting worse. My boyfriend of 3 years began to notice my changes. I have became completely depressed. I am now looking into getting my rod removed ASAP""",8
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I loved the shot as far as having no periods at all! But that was the only good thing about it. My hair fell out like crazy, lots of hair loss while brushing my hair, shampooing and just touching it. And it didnt stop. I have only had one shot which lasted for the 3 months and since day one of the shot my hair has fallen out. It used to be so thick, now my hair is thin. Not only hair loss, I had terrible terrible mood swings. Mad for no reason all the time. I have spoken to other people that took this and they said the hair loss never gets better, only worse. I did not gain weight, I was hoping to as I weigh 112, but I did not gain in 3 months time.  I am not going back for my second shot, the hair loss and mood swings is not worth it.""",8

I lost all my baby weight and got down to 255 but quickly gained most of it back from the breastfeeing  (exclusively breastfed for 15 months. I had daughter number two in November 2014 and weighed 278. I quickly lost the baby weight once again and got down to 255 but had even worse cravings this time (breastfed only 4 months). Even after I quit breastfeeding my cravings continued. I felt like I was always hungry, nothing satisfied me and I could never get full. Not to mention my energy level was lower than ever. I joined the ymca but didn&#039;t have much luck with that due to my eating habits and lack of energy. I started Adipex yesterday (May 13) and weighed in at 275. WILL CONTINUE""",3

Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""What would I give to not take medication! I am 18, and have been taking Concerta for 3 years now. It helps me to keep things in order, stop forgetting things, concentrate in class for long periods of time, do mundane tasks I hate. However, within the first week of taking it I will feel very moody, have tics, etc. I get excited and anxious easily. In the evenings, it is impossible to concentrate and it gets me often very frustrated or irritable. I have been considering changing medications or stopping because it suppresses my creativity and will have me concentrate on negative thoughts causing depression. However, the withdrawal effects will make me very lazy, depressed, or even manic. """,1
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Taking 30mg daily now for insomnia.  Best medicine  I have ever taken for insomnia.  When I took my first 30mg pill it worked great.  Maybe too good.  I slept 8 hours and if I didn&#039;t have any repsonsibilities it felt like I could sleep another 4 hours.  I had to drag myself out of bed, but it still was a quality sleep.  I started taking as needed but at lower does.  3.4mg, 7.5mg, 15mg.  Seems to have a long half-life so some days I didn&#039;t take at all and it still worked.  After awhile the effects started wearing off so I started taking 30mg every day for about a month now and it seems to be still working.  I tried to increase to 45mg but at that dose it seems not work for sleep anymore.  The maximum I can take for sleep is 30mg.""",0
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I was on Phentermine 3 Years ago and lost 150lbs in a year and a half.  I worked out and because it curbs your appetite I could eat healthier.  You really need to work out and use it as a tool to help you with your new lifestyle because if you don&#039;t the weight WILL come back on plus more.  I kept it off for 3 years but then had a job change that kept me from going to the gym in the morning &amp; afternoons and didn&#039;t work out with the kids. I gained 150 lbs back in 3 years.  I just started again on 08/12 and have lost 25lbs. I haven&#039;t got into a steady gym routine now but it&#039;s motivated me to go to the gym in the afternoons.  I chose a different center for the gym because my kids can play basketball or swim while I work out.""",2

So now I have to figure out how to tighten my tummy. Now I am back to square one since I quit taking it due to change in insurance....... so I have gained more weight now but Qsymia is an awesome diet capsule and it does work........""",3
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I took Cymbalta for 4 days for anxiety, panic attacks and mild depression. I read many reviews and wondered whether I should stick with it despite the side effects, but in the end I just couldn&#039;t. 

I&#039;ve been on Lexapro and Effexor before and I was expecting the same type of side effects: dry mouth, nausea, headaches. But this was a lot worse. 

I was sleeping ok before, and started having insomnia from Cymbalta. My heart was also racing, which for a panic attack sufferer, is the worst thing that can happen. I almost stopped eating, no appetite at all. I also started feeling really low, super anxious and depressed, and could only go through the day with the use of alprazolam. In the end I spoke to my doctor and I will now start on Pristiq""",7
Duac,Acne,"""I used Duac after being prescribed it for a good six months (on repeat prescription). To begin with, my skin flared up bright red and it dried my skin out terribly. I then reduced the amount I was using from the fingertip amount which is recommended on the box to the merest bit on each area of acne. This worked a treat, and within 2-3 weeks my skin was looking much better. Over the next 6 months or so, my skin improved and I only had a small break out once in a while. However, I felt that after using it for 6 months, my skin had become accustomed to it and I was having more and more break outs. I stayed off the cream for a good four months. I am now back on the cream, and going through the phase of the skin drying out etc.""",4
Phentermine,Obesity,"""On the recommendation of a friend I started taking Phentermine 37.5. Went to the MD on 3/30/15. I didn&#039;t want to wait to start next day so I took my first pill in the car at noon on the 30th. Starting weight 284.5lbs. Literally hunger vanished, no cravings. Woke up next day, lost 1.5 lbs. Today, 4/1, I am down 3.2 lbs and haven&#039;t even taken my 3rd pill yet. I&#039;m going to go to the gym today to see if that boosts the effect. I&#039;m eating very lightly. Trying to stay below 1200 Cals a day. This pill really helps with not making poor decisions. The doctor recommended drinking gulps of water between each biteful of food. And to unlearn the bad habit of eating til I&#039;m full or cleaning the plate. He recommended using a bread plate as my guide.""",2

I have been on this medication for two weeks today. I have previously taken Phentermine 37.5 for 4 months and Belviq does not compare at all.  Belviq has done nothing to suppress my appetite;  I am actually hungrier than I was prior to taking Belviq. I am also exhausted everyday. I never had appetite issues, but on a low calorie diet I am starving. This was a waste of $265 that I definitely didn&#039;t have to spend.""",3
Concerta,ADHD,"""My son has been on Concerta for about 4 years now. He started when he was 6 yrs and will be 11yrs in 2 weeks. He was put on this medicine starting with 18mg. Over time he was gradually put on higher dose as his age and weight increased. He is now on 54mg. Since my son has been on this medicine he has developed seizures because Concerta lowers the seizure threshold. He was diagnosed last year 2010. He has paranoia, fearfulness, psychosis, headaches, nervousness, aggression, mood swings, trouble going to sleep, and doesn&#039;t want to eat a lot. He has had suicidal thoughts and depression.""",1
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I did a lot of research on Mirena and was honestly scared after reading lots of reviews. I was going go with the Depo shot and my doctor talked me out of it. I had REALLY BAD MIGRAINES on the pill, not to mention remembering to take them. If you look at other birth control sites, just replace Mirena with Depo, pills, or the ring. It&#039;s all the same side effects and issues. We ALL REACT DIFFERENTLY! My doctor explained the process VERY WELL and he told me that some doctors actually do a cruddy job at insertion, hence the reasoning some women have issues. I&#039;M SO HAPPY I chose Mirena. I spotted for the 1st couple of months along with cramping. I&#039;ve had 1 period, my sex drive is great.""",8
Adapalene,Acne,"""It will worsen for the first two weeks. After that , you&#039;ll clear up. Believe me I had the worst acne and I had never had this before in my entire life. My face was full of big , cystic acne , a lot of pustules and they&#039;re really awful! I am into adapalene 0.3 % for 6 weeks now and I am literally close to clear skin. I had a slight skin discoloration due to the scarring but I can see that a lot of these had faded. PATIENCE AND CONSISTENCY are the keys. Stick to it and have faith and you&#039;ll clear in no time. I love this product.""",4
Aczone,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had moderate acne until I was about 15 then it started breaking out severely on my cheeks since I moved to Texas with the weather and hormones started kicking in. Also I was always oily and still am sadly And going to the dermatologist to figure out how to deal with it. I&#039;m now 17 and I never wear makeup and religiously wash my face and use a toner. I went to the dermatologist Recently and they gave me a prescription of Aczone and it cleared my face up in about 1 and a half to 2 months. My face burned, purged, and dried (don&#039;t pick!!!!!!!)but it helped. You just have to stick with it and give yourself a Pep talk that it&#039;s worth it at the end. I&#039;m am left with a few pimples. it&#039;s better than the cystic outbreaks and clogged pores I had.""",4
Lithium,Depression,"""I have major depression and borderline personality traits (Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) has helped), and chronic suicidal thoughts for over 30 years. I am on Mirtazapine 30mg, Bupropion XL 300mg for over two years. Because of my suicidal thoughts my Dr put me on lithium three weeks ago. She started with 300mg then went up to 600mg. They only bad side affect for me was a very dry mouth. After 2 weeks of being on it it started feeling wonderful! And it helped my suicidal thoughts tremendously. I felt so much better and have more energy ! Then she decided to bump me up to 900mg per day. The only side effect I feel is, I feel like there is pressure on my brain. I&#039;m hoping this is going to go away like my dry mouth. I also am not sleeping well either.""",5
Strattera,ADHD,"""I wanted to do an updated review on this medication. I am in my 9th month of taking it, and, before Obama Care I ran out a few times, and the effects were very noticeable. Even though it is not supposed to have classic SSRI withdrawal symptoms, I still had severe brain zaps. I have my script filled and I am back on it. I am such a better worker, listener and planner on this medication. I am a better version of myself. Love it! I take 40mg a day, 60mg was too much.  I am 160lbs tall female 34 yo.""",1
Cymbalta,Depression,"""It is difficult to wean off this medication. I missed one dose and the next day was planning on picking up my prescription and I actually had to leave work early because I became so sick (after only one missed dose). Vertigo, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting. I was on 90 mg, then went to 60 mg, then 30, 20, 15, and now 7.5 mg over the course of a month and I am still sick. Vertigo is the worst. I am nauseous every day.

Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""My experience has been horrible. I got Nexplanon 6 weeks after giving birth. I had gotten pregnant while I was on the pill so I wanted to try something different. I&#039;ve been bleeding for three and a half months straight. Severe acne and mood swings. I&#039;ve been feeling really depressed for no reason. I&#039;ve gained 15 pounds I can&#039;t seem to lose. And this last month I have been having horrible flu like symptoms. It feels like it&#039;s taking over my life. I&#039;m getting it out this month.""",8
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I haven&#039;t been on this long. My highest weight this week was 228 at the Dr and 225.7 at home and I am now down to 220.9. I am 5&#039;5 and 32. The nausea is bearable, what isn&#039;t is being overweight. It has definitely curbed my appetite. I find that if I can eat through the nausea then I feel better. I am apprehensive of drinking too much on this medication. I still have had a glass of wine. Constipation is noticeable but I will look into a laxative. I haven&#039;t really been feeling tired, though I am only on 0.6 until Thursday. I don&#039;t want to start any happy dances until I am under 200, but I am not going to object the weight loss I have already witnessed. I definitely have hope. I&#039;ll check in again to update on my progress.""",2
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 50. I was in school before ADD and ADHD were a thing. Those of us that couldn&#039;t pay attention or behave got C&#039;s and D&#039;s, and we liked it that way. I&#039;m kidding, we didn&#039;t like it that way and neither did our parents. I muddled through high school and even got a college degree, but I really struggled. I remember when I first heard of ADD and meds that treat it, and it was a revelation. I&#039;ve tried many of these medications and Concerta is my favorite. To me, it&#039;s the smoothest.  The short acting drugs hit too strongly and then quickly crash. Hard. I had been taking Metidate CD until an insurance change made Concerta cheaper. Concerta is smoother than Metidate.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am female 5&#039;3&quot; top weight 169. I started Contravene 4 weeks ago, I just finished my first week at the max dose of 2 morning/2evening and I have enough to last me about 2 more weeks at that dose. I have not lost any weight but I did get down to 160 and have fluctuated between 163-167 over the past week, just up and down and its frusrating as heck!!
During week 1 was nearly ready to quit; I couldn&#039;t sleep, the fatigue was unbearable, and I wanted to eat everything. Now my problem has never been eating bad or not exercising. My problem is that about 7 years ago I began packing on 6-10lbs a year. So, suddenly wanting to pig out was a major deviation from my norm. Week 2-3 were great, energy/appetite were tops. Week four I&#039;m tired again!""",2
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Since I was 13 I&#039;ve always had acne. Now as I&#039;m 16, my acne has gotten to its worst so I decided to finally open up my drawer and begin using my Tretinoin Cream 0.025 that I was prescribed to by my Derm 2 months ago but decided not to try since I knew of the purging that would be happening. 2 weeks in and my skin is undoubtedly in its purging phase, although the first week was amazing. My skin was almost clear and had very little inflammation. DO NOT STOP USING THIS PRODUCT! Can&#039;t wait to see its results in a couple months. I have a lot of hope for this drug.""",4
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""Falling asleep can be a bit of a challenge when my back and legs are cramping. Feels like a broom stick is constantly pushing hard on lower left side of back. This pill said take immediately before bed. It takes about 70 minutes for me to shut down after taking it. Other pills give aching shoulder and joints this one does not and no grogginess either. I can sleep through at least 6 hours after use and I appreciate the development of one medicine that works for me as I have tried many and they do not work well or have negative side effects.""",0
Belviq,Obesity,"""On day 6, I noticed a little more room in my belt and decided to weigh a day early - 194.5lbs down to 187lbs. I&#039;ve lost 55 pounds from my tubbiest in 2003 (about 20 of that was water weight when I got my pacemaker replaced) but hit a plateau around 195lbs for the last 6 months. My goal is 170lbs by year end. My trepidation about being a guinea pig for a new medicine is more than balanced by the ease and amount of the result. I&#039;m expecting further improvement in backache and joint pain as my weight continues to drop.
Now on day 14 at 184 pounds, I&#039;ve lost 10 pounds, twice my stretch goal, and feel great.  This is too easy!""",2
Cymbalta,Pain,"""I developed Occipital Neuralgia, left side, some years ago.  After several treatments with pain specialists and no results, I tried Cymbalta.  In 7 weeks I was pain free. This continued for a couple of years until I broke my leg and had to spend 3 months in a nursing home.  At the nursing home, the physician switched me to Wellbutrin [less expensive] which was OK but not as good as Cymbalta.  After about two years on Bupropion my left side is still OK but it has now developed on my right side.  Since I am still taking Bupropion, it obviously isn&#039;t working.  I&#039;m going to see my physician for Cymbalta.""",9
Duloxetine,Depression,"""Cymbalta 120mg for 4 months
Good:
- slight to moderate increase in motivation, mental energy and attention/alertness.
- decrease in anxiety and depressive feelings.
Bad:
- made me less social, less empathetic and more robotic.
- horrible withdrawal symptoms which happen quickly if you forget to take it.
- when my dosage was increased from 30mg to 60mg, it started to give me nightmares at night and caused me to wake up in middle of the night and lose sleep.

Conclusion: Better positive cognitive experience than 10mg Escitalopram which other than positively affecting my mood, all it did was cause constant brain fogs and decrease my motivation even further.""",5
Modafinil,Depression,"""I have been working for many years with one combination after another of medications for bi polar disorder. I was recently on oxcarbazapine and lithium which was great for a few months. Depression came back and I had unpleasant side effects with the oxcarbazapine. My doc added modafanil. It reduced the side effects and improved my depression. It also caused irritability. And caffeine made me restless even with a small amount.""",5
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been taking Strattera since I was finally diagnosed in February with predominately inattentive type ADHD and I think I might stop taking it altogether. It&#039;s helped with my attention span a little, but the side effects largely overshadow this. I have never experienced such agonizing headaches since I started taking this medication, to the point where I&#039;ve had to call off work several times because I&#039;m so nauseous from the pain. It might just be the combination of medications (I also take Wellbutrin, Zoloft, and Trazodone), but I&#039;d rather live without the headaches than continue taking Strattera hoping it will one day work.""",1
Yasmin,Acne,"""I had horrible cystic acne on my chin (5-6 large, angry, agonising, red lumps at any one time) &amp; they started to creep along my lower cheek which is when I decided to take oral contraception to help it stop.

Now 6 months on from starting yasmin my skin is better than its ever been and I am only left with slight hyperpigmentation which is easy to cover with makeup. Not 1 new spot this month and NO oil at all! Seriously, not even a shiny nose!

Results only started at around 5 months so please, please keep at it. 1st month my breasts grew and hurt alot but by month 2 they went back to their normal size and I felt no more pain.

Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m sixty-eight years old and have dealt with anxiety/depression my whole life.  There were some medicines over the years that helped, but for one reason or another, I had to stop taking them. But five years ago (July 17,2007) I had an acute neurological episode that awoke me from sleep straight into a Carnival Midway atmosphere. Very disturbing, and my sleep was never restful from that day forward. Four different polysomnograms verified I was getting less than a third of normal REM sleep.  Six months ago I discovered Ambien and was quite pleased, but I was recently to see a pain management doctor who understands the value of good sleep in dealing with chronic pain; his preference is Trileptal so I went on it. Never felt this relaxed and normal.""",7
Adapalene,Acne,"""My eleven-year-old son was prescribed adapelene cream 0.1% by his dermatologist a couple of months ago.  She said that it might turn his skin red and burn so maybe use it every other night.

Aczone,Acne,"""I am 36 and in the past year began getting cystic acne on my chin, cheeks and temples.  The cysts were incredibly red, itchy, and painful. They never came to a head and seemed to never fully heal.  Because they wouldn&#039;t heal, I would pick at them.  Last week, I broke out with 17 at once.  I was very embarrassed,  got fed up and saw a dermatologist. He prescibed Doxycycline and Aczone 2x per day.  Amazing results in less than a week!

It helped me a lot. I was told by a friend to take it for pain and I&#039;m glad I got it.""",9
Tramadol,Pain,"""CAUTION!  Used tramadol 50 mg for back pain. Started with 1 tab couple of days/wk, eventually up to a tab/day, finally tab/day and 2 tabs/day a couple days/week. Withdrawal would kick in about 18-24 hrs after last dose. Lethargy, tired, felt like the flu. Took tab, w/in an hour felt great. Read about this as potential problem, began to wean myself off. Took several months. Every step down resulted in above withdrawal symptoms (but worse), and the most horrible part was the restless body (RLS, but all over) at night when trying to sleep. Felt ready to explode. After taking 1/4 tab/day for weeks, used some leftover partial valium tabs to finally break free from tramadol.  Avoid tramadol if at all possible - withdrawal is absolutely horrible.""",9
Strattera,ADHD,"""This medication sucks. I took 20mg Adderall XR, which worked wonderfully for my ADHD, for a month, but had to get off of it, because I have Tourette Syndrome and Adderall aggravated my tics.

I took a 25mg capsule last night around 7 PM, and an hour later, I was nauseous/lost my appetite, and I experienced sexual dysfunction (it took over an hour to reach a burning, painful orgasm).

That all came crashing down when the love of my life and girlfriend of 5 months tried to have sex on our 5 month , which was also valentine&#039;s day. Here we are, both virgins, about make love and I CANNOT GET AN ERECTION. I&#039;ve looked into it a bit and know that the first time can be difficult for a lot of guys. But it just didn&#039;t feel right, so I&#039;m posting a warning.""",4
Paroxetine,Depression,"""First off I just want to say, please don&#039;t be alarmed/afraid when you read that your going to gain a tremendous amount of weight while taking Paxil. Not saying by any means anybody is lying nor the information they provide about this medicine is false. Everybody is different and will receive different results. I almost contacted my physician right away, in demands I obtain a different medication after hearing about the weight gain, however, I gave it a fair chance. I did NOT want to a eat a thing while on Paxil and my friends already noticed I&#039;ve dropped a significant amount of weight. Please don&#039;t avoid this medication because of freight about weight gain because it might very well not happen! My social anxiety also vanished.""",5
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Used this for a month and did not lose any weight. I read some reviews and did not go through any of the symptoms I saw. I gave it 2 stars because aI did notice it suppressed my appetite a little. I refilled and gave it another shot but the next month was more of the same. Went off it a few days, maybe a week, and this morning I took one......... Holy crap I feel like an ice cube. Never been this cold in my life and also been in the bathroom all day with #2 imitating a faucet. I can honestly say, soon as I get out this bed, rest of them are going in the trash. Worst $190 (2 months with discount card) I have ever spent on a weightloss gimmick. Now back to the meal plan and lots of exercise.""",3
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""There are various manufacturer of clonazepam. I always made sure to stay with the same manufacturer. However, a week into taking the pills from my new prescription I started to feel very ill. I still had several pills from my previous refill because I only required  1/2 of the 0.5 mg. It was prescribed for me for chronic neck pain. The manufacturer changed the ingredients and now I have been suffering for months to find a replacement to no avail. It&#039;s been working well for years but right now the horrible effects I&#039;m getting I don&#039;t think I&#039;d recommended to any one. Please try every option before having to suffer the consequences in the long run.""",7
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""In my 25 years of being put on various medications, this is--by far--the best.  I suffered from anxiety and PTSD, which (of course) would lead to depression.  I&#039;d contend with crying spells and outbursts of anger.  The first few days of taking 75 mg/day, I did have some side effects (such as racing thoughts, sleeplessness, etc.), but my body adjusted quickly.  I now wake up every day feeling more hopeful, and with ZERO crying spells.  I am still ME, and never feel like a zombie.  I am still aware of my surroundings and what annoys me, yes, but my RECOVERY from processing those things is much faster, and I bounce right back.  In other words, my perspective of things is normalized, and my days aren&#039;t ruined.  Wonderful stuff!""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on claravis 60mg a day (30 mg twice daily) for almost 3 months now. I&#039;ve seen some great improvement but I really expected to be completely clear by now. However I just read that you&#039;re supposed to take this pill with food and I haven&#039;t been doing that. Symptoms are horrible. Worst muscle aches I&#039;ve ever had in my life and my lips are so dry putting on Carmex every 10 seconds still barely helps. I used to have beautiful long shiny hair and now my hair is extremely stringy and brittle and I can only wash it once a week. I always feel sick and dehydrated and no amount of water I drink helps. Also my skin is a really weird texture. Headaches so bad sometimes I can&#039;t even see straight. Im trying so hard to stick it out but well see""",4
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I have been in chronic pain for 11 years, worsening in the last year.  Finally a pain management doctor prescribed me 25mg of amitriptyline and it worked overnight. Magically the next day my pain was down to a completely manageable level. I have my life back thanks to this medicine.  Dizziness the first day or two, dry-mouth only if I stay up long after I&#039;ve taken the medicine.  Don&#039;t hesitate to take this medicine if you have nerve pain, it is a miracle.""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Concerta has helped me tremendously in school. My grades skyrocketed after only one semester of use. The first day, when I was on 18mg, I could already feel the effect. 
Now, I only take concerta (27mg) on school days and other days which I know are going to be exhausting. Even on the days I don&#039;t take it, I feel happier than before. Concerta  gives me motivation so I can actually live, which makes my motivation stick around. I can now socialise without feeling like my energy has been sucked out of me after one conversation. I can now do my homework and chores. I do things in my free time, instead of crashing in bed after a day of school.

Though my appetite changed, and I lost a lot of weight, I have a lot to thank concerta for.""",1
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal has been a life saver. Started when I was 18, after 4 years of unsuccessful treatment plus 2-3 years of emotional instability not treated. Started lamictal and I finally felt like &quot;the person I was always supposed to grow up to be&quot;. I do get the &quot;morning woozies&quot; when I increase the dose for worsening symptoms, but I have been more or less in remission. Very minimal side effects, and generally effective as stand alone maintenance drug.""",6
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""Hello! I am a nurse and I suffer from anxiety and depression from very early age. I used many antidepressants through the years, but nothing was as helpful such as diazepam. It&#039;s a miracle drug.Finaly, maby in first timemy life l am filling calm and so secure   Because I am a nurse I was very afraid to take this kind of drugs, because I listened many times that this kind of drugs, called benzodiazepines can create an addiction  in a very short time, but my psychotherapist told me: &quot;yes, that&#039;s kind of drugs can be addictive, but who cares if it make you to feel good? It not working such narcotic drugs- usually you don&#039;t need to take larger amounts of drug through the years in order to receive the same influence.&quot;""",7
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""My #1 prayer is that someone will read this BEFORE they put this poison in their body referred to as Mirena. I had the IUD put in after my Implanon was removed (btw, Implanon was incredible, for me. But my OB insisted I got Mirena). I had it in for about 5 years, yes my periods were light but sex sucked; it was painful during and after, I was never &quot;in the mood&quot;. I gained about 50 pounds, grew depressed obviously. Usually athletic and excited to work out, I became super tired and lazy all of the time. It took a toll on my relationship, I don&#039;t even see why he stayed with me (but he&#039;s amazing ☺️)! About a month ago I got the IUD removed. It was a short, sweet procedure and I instantly felt better (just knowing it was out of me gave me so much satisfaction). I was on a light period when it was removed and it eventually ended as normal.... one month later I started my period again (normal). But I have been bleeding since, it&#039;s been about 3.5-4 weeks. And if I&#039;m not &quot;bleeding&quot; I have brown discharge (looks like dried up blood). I feel crummy and I long for normalness! I felt as if I have taken 5 steps forward, getting it removed, just to take ten steps back! Don&#039;t do it! At this point I wouldn&#039;t advise bc at all but obviously people use it for other reasons besides getting pregnant. Nevertheless, the hormonal imbalance and emotional toll is not worth it! I pray after all of this I can even conceive another child. I don&#039;t know this for a fact: but I feel like there&#039;s got to be some kind of extra financial gain for OBs when they insert Mirena. Do what is best for you and don&#039;t be afraid to say no, or ask every question you need to... I wish I would&#039;ve. Best wishes, ladies!""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""Just started on week two where I take one pill in the morning and one in the evening.  In 9 days I have lost 5.6 pounds &amp; have not a darn thing.  Granted in general I am not a huge sweets person or snacker - but trying to drop weight without starving myself or doing zero carbs - the scale wouldn&#039;t budge... Seeing the weight drop with no effort, just yet, is inspiring.  I love a nice cold beer &amp; perhaps indulge a little too much on weekends - but I now notice I don&#039;t really care if I have a beer or not.  losing almost 6 pounds is now motivating me to start eating cleaner and get walking / start some exercise regimen. Side effects I sweat more &amp; sleep is not that great(but I also have hyperdrosis &amp; take adderall). Will post after week 4""",2
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I used prozac in the past for 3-9 months twice and had no side effects apart from some headache for a few weeks. Now I have been on it again for 3 weeks and this time I am suffering SEVERE side effects. Physical ones include heavy fogginess/head pressure, sleeplessness, muscle tension, blurred vision and loss of appetite and weight loss. Mentally I have also worsened. Anxiety is really high, especially in the mornings, feelings of hopelessness an inability to cope with life, suicidal thoughts (that I never really had before), inability to focus/read and feel motivated. Now at 3 weeks I have some moments in the afternoon of feeling calmer but it is rather unpleasant numbness. I hope it improves going forward, but it has been very tough.""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""This is my second time trying this medication. The first time I was not ready and didn&#039;t really make any lifestyle changes and didn&#039;t lose weight. So my Dr recommend it again and even said that he was going to take it too. That had me motivated and needless to say when I went back for my month follow up, he walked right past me because he said he almost didn&#039;t recognize me. I have been on this medication for about 6 months and I&#039;m down 37lbs! Largest weight loss in my life!! I started at 264lb. I don&#039;t exercise but I have been practicing clean eating. Only eating salmon and no other meat, and eating veggies and fruit. It&#039;s been working.... and my Dr is also down some lbs!!!""",2

I have insomnia from chronic pain, and severe PTSD. 2mg Lunesta got me 4hrs rest. 3mg got me 6hrs sleep. I finally got 8 hours sleep by raising my dose to 2-2mg pills per night. I didn&#039;t get 4, 6, or, 8 hrs sleep until I changed eating habits. Plan your evening like so: eat a small portion of healthy foods. Wait 20-30 minutes, and then take your Lunesta. Wait 20-30 minutes, and eat another small portion of healthy food, and head to bed. The food keeps the medicine in your system longer. Also for those paying cash like me, use blinkhealth.com. I get my 60-2mg pills for $53.16 a month.""",0
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I am a 48 year old married mom of four 5&quot;1 176 lbs. My doctor told me I needed to lose 20 lbs to start and eventually an additional 35 lbs to avoid high blood pressure as well diabetes. I have Medifasted, grapefruit diet, Weight Watchers with no success. I did many over the counter rip offs. This medicine works... four months, lost 26 pounds and I am going down the right road. Still have a way as to go but know I will win. I am not starved and eat well just make better choices easier then I ever thought this could be. This is a product that worked for me and should work for you.""",3
Minocycline,Acne,"""I started using minocycline exactly 3 weeks ago. At first the medication was fine and I did not notice any side effects. Within the first week, my acne got worse. Second week was even worse. Third week was just awful. Not only did my acne get worse than when I had initially started, but my body started breaking out in red dots that became itchy and unbearable! By week 2 I would wake up dizzy and nauseated. I ended up going to my dermatologist today and she switched me to another medication- Septra. Fingers crossed that I DO NOT have another reaction that minocycline gave me!""",4
Belviq,Obesity,"""Weighed 270 on 5-8-15! 8 days later I weigh 263. If I take it early before 9 am I feel drunk or really tired but if I take it later after 9-10 am I feel ok! Im excited to see how this goes if I can afford it! With out insurance coverage its $305.00 month! Very expensive but I almost say its worth it as long as I&#039;m loosing weight in a decent timely manner! Light exercise but I work up a  sweat and drink lots of water""",2
Acanya,Acne,"""awful product. did not do anything it was supposed to. I have very very mild acne. I wouldn&#039;t even call it acne, just pimples. and everytime I have tried to use acanya it hasn&#039;t helped with any pimples and just left my face red and burned the next day. This redness stays for at least 4 days. It&#039;s so embarrassing and not worth it for a product that just makes your pimples MORE obvious because of HUGE red spots. awful product. throwing it in the garbage so I never have the idea of using it again.""",4
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""My son, now 10, was diagnosed with impulse control issues. He has always had As and Bs in school and always loves to read. He gets bored alot in class and his impulse control (blurting out, saying what&#039;s on his mind/no filter) had caused him to be put in alternative school (where his grades began to falter). Over the summer, we had him evaluated and they said that meds would help. Our general physician didn&#039;t want to put him on a stimulant and suggested Straterra. First 2 months @ 60mg. Lost 15lbs (which put him at the right weight actually) and slept all the time. Backed off to 40mg since then and he&#039;s maintained his weight, sleeps well and maintained grades. Too bad our monthly script cost increased x9. Looking for a cheaper alternative.""",1
OxyContin,Pain,"""I&#039;m 19 years old and have been suffering from severe testicular and groin pain for the past 5 months, due to a sports injury. It prevented me from doing the things I had previously loved doing, I couldn&#039;t go back to school, and I&#039;d be in bed all day. But now that my pain doctor has put me on OxyContin 20 mg twice a day, I feel like I&#039;m getting my life back. This medication keeps my pain at bay. Before, I&#039;d be going through an average of 8/10 pain everyday, but OxyContin miraculously brings it down to a 2-3! I really mean it when I say OxyContin is a Godsend for a male who&#039;s going through testicular pain caused by numerous problems. Best of all it doesn&#039;t make me tired so I can properly function throughout the day!""",9
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking seroquel for a little over a year and a half now and it has been the best thing for me. I started off at 350mg when my mania was insanely uncontrollable. But after 2 months I was able to go down to 250 and ever since its been perfect because I don&#039;t fight the drowsiness in the mornings and get a great nights rest. I did gain weight, only 20 pounds, but I have always been extremely athletic (2 sport collegiate athlete) and it didn&#039;t really affect me at all.  Just as long as it keeps the manic/depressive episodes on lock down I think I can handle a curvier body.

I seriously reccommend this if you can handle a little weight gain!""",6
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on Accutane for three months now and have already seen a major difference in my skin. My skin used to be super oily to the point where even right after I washed my face there was a layer of oil. After the first month all the oil had dried up, but I still had acne (which is obviously to be expected). Now, after just 3 months my acne is almost completely gone. Granted, I always have to have chapstick wherever I go since my lips are very dry, but it is manageable. I also have to make sure to apply lotion regularly especially on colder days. Other than the dryness, I have had no other side effects and would certainly say that the side effects I have had are worth it.""",4
Pristiq,Depression,"""I rated Pristiq a 9 for the simple fact that although it was really helped me get out of depression, I have been having crazy vivid dreams.  The dreams are not pleasant, or bad, just weird.  I have flashbacks about them all through the day, and I can recall almost every little detail.  Some might argue that this is not a bad side effect, however, because of this, I&#039;ve been having poor sleep.

All this said, it wouldn&#039;t be a reason for me to get off the medication.  It has really given me back my life!""",5
Pristiq,Depression,"""This medicine has been very helpful to me. I started having extreme anxiety when I started taking Latuda. For two years I dealt with depression, severe anxiety and killer side effects from the SSRI (avoid them). In 2014 I finally said &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; I was a little scared to try a different medicine but life was so terrible I was willing to get some relief. I did not have any side effects when started taking the medicine. Pristiq has given some of my life back. I can function at the day program (which was in jeopardy before Pristiq) I highly recommend this medicine for those who suffer from depression and anxiety, at lease give it a try.""",5
Diclofenac,Pain,"""Finally some relief! I suffer from neck/shoulder pain due to a horrific auto accident years ago where my head hit the steering wheel so hard it bent it. I also suffer terribly from Fibromyalgia &amp; arthritis. I have tried Vicodin, Norco, Lortab, Tramadol, Oxycodone etc. as well as Lidoderm patch with absolutely no relief. Morphine worked well but I didn&#039;t like the side effects. My doctor suggested the Flector patch and altho I had little hope -- THEY WORKED!!  They don&#039;t take the pain away completely but do take it down to a manageable level (ie, from 8/9 to 4/5). My only complaint is that I can only wear 2 patches maximum and wish I could put a patch on every pain site. They are amazing!!""",9
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have just started Quetiapine (Seroquel) going form 25mg to 75mg now. I was previously using lithium and have gradually reduced it to 250mg, now I do not take it and have replaced with seroquel. I am concerned about the side effects at higher doses and I would like to know if anyone has gone from using lithium to seroquel as a modd stabilsier. I am doing this as I am trying to get pregnant and my doctor has told me that seroquel is a good substitute up to the 2nd trimester of a pregnancy where I would re-introduce lithium.""",6
Saxenda,Obesity,"""My starting weight was 297. Now two weeks later I&#039;m 283. After each increase I did have nausea and vomiting for a day or two. I thought I would have to stop and then I discovered Pepto-Bismol.  My second day of Pepto-Bismol I felt like a new man. According to the label you can have 2 tablespoons up to eight times a day which means every couple hours. This really made a difference in the side affects. I rated it a 9 only because of the side effects other than that I&#039;m 100% satisfied with this new medication!""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Really severe side effects - if they don&#039;t improve soon I will not continue on this medication - I don&#039;t need ongoing severe nausea and dizziness (among other problems).Then there is the ridiculously complicates Saxenda Care administration system:  I was given a sample pack from my doctor and then (very expensive) prescription which is only for the Saxenda itself - not the needles ...  apparently I need to sign up for the Saxenda Care programme - which includes the bar code for the product (of course everyone carries that sort of information around with them..!!!) - my GP  apparently could not sign me up as she had given me a starter pack...  Then Saxenda Care needed to arrange delivery of the needles to a designated pharmacy for collection""",2
Differin,Acne,"""Had my derma check up for my moderate acne on cheek and chin and she prescribed me this (Adapalene) Differin Gel 0.3. For the first week I saw a little improvement on my cheek as the tiny pimples somehow disappear. By the way I have some cystic acne on cheek and chin. For the following weeks   as I saw the improvement, suddenly came the breakouts on my 4th month. Hoping this is the breakout I&#039;ve read before the clearing process of the medication. Is anybody here that had the same situation before?""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""245 to 195 from July 03, 2015 to December 25, 2015. I was prescribed Phentermine 37.5mg as a weight loss supplement and used this in conjunction with My Fitness Pal Calorie Counter and very irregular exercise, haha. I noticed an increase in energy and most of my cravings disappeared. My only side effect was cotton-mouth, but only if I didn&#039;t drink enough water. Goal is 140 and I will get there. Husband was so impressed that he started in Sept and went from 198 to 174 in just over a month! I am so grateful for this medication and am getting ready to start again!""",3
Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,"""My main issue was facing depression for years and took several antidepressants in the past. I don&#039;t have bipolar, but my psychiatrist decided to try a mood stabilizer for the first time since antidepressants weren&#039;t working and since I tried to commit suicide for the 2nd time a few months back. 

Trileptal has completely took away my depression. Even when I hit a bump in the road, I&#039;m not even close to the person I was a few months ago. I&#039;m able to work 6 days a week, have more energy, and my thoughts of suicide are no longer present. Having a BA in psychology I want to add that meds are not a &quot;cure&quot;, but sometimes it is better than wanting to take your life and at least be an aid to help you get back on track.""",7
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I have degenerative disc disease. Medication works well. I have been on it for a year now with my oxycodone. It works miracles, I can go to work everyday and support my family ans when I come home I can actually enjoy the daily activities with my children, I once could not have thought of doing. I am so glad my life is back and am so grateful for a great doctor who after years found a way to put me back on my feet.""",9
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I have been on Belviq for 9 days now and have lost 7 lbs.  The first day I had a severe headache and some dizziness.  I only took one pill that day.  My headache and dizziness went away once the pill wore off.  Started again the next day and no headache so I kept going and took the two pills that day.  I have had no side effects since that first day.  It does curb my appetite and I haven&#039;t been hungry.  I am using my fitbit and the MyFitnessPal app to keep up with my exercise, calories and water intake.  I need to lose around 65 pounds.   Belviq costs me $75 a month, I got the discount coupon from my doctor.

Aripiprazole,Depression,"""I started this medicine a week ago and found that I actually have energy again.  After years of being so tired after work I have to drag myself through the evening just waiting and wishing to go to bed. Now I can play with my kids, do some housework and even relax for a while after I have accomplished so many things.  I have done more in a week than in the last month.  And I feel like planning things (like outing with friends and vacations) and I am excited about them instead of feel like it was just another thing I HAD to do.  I have had a little insomnia, but I find if I take it in the morning, I am ok by evening and sleep fairly well.  I think and am eating more, so I will have to watch. Overall, good experience, hope it lasts!""",5
Tramadol,Pain,"""Tramadol would MILDLY work for my back and knee pain for about a week and then stop.  Oxycodone works best for me and hydrocodone is second.  If it works for your pain, great but my experience is that it does nothing more than ibuprofen or other OTC pain relievers in the long run.  The physical withdrawal from tramadol in my opinion is worse than hydrocodone or oxycodone due to the dual action it has on the brain.""",9
Duac,Acne,"""Be warned. This product is strong chemical and should not be applied all over &#039;the affected area&#039; that has healthy skin with couple of blocked pores/comedones  but ONLY ON SPOTS. I&#039;ve burned my skin with this product, trying to recover this dry, patchy, red mess has caused new breakouts. I also got 3 new breakouts after first application. After second they got smaller in size (for that it gets better rate than 1). After 3rd I looked like I&#039;ve been attacked. I&#039;ve stopped using it and won&#039;t continue due to bad reaction. My skin is at all time low and I would have been better off without it.""",4
Pristiq,Anxiety,"""I am into my 4th week of Pristiq and it hasn&#039;t yet kicked in.  I still require a clonazepam every morning for the anxiety when I get up.  The wild dreams have finally subsided as have the sweating.  I was on Zoloft for 10 years which worked wonderfully for me until it quit working. I tried Celexa - didn&#039;t work, tried Effexor XR - didn&#039;t work and had a lot of side effects with it.  Pristiq is supposed to be from the same family as Effexor so possibly this may not work.  One can only keep hoping.""",7
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""Just started taking 5 mg twice a day. Doesn&#039;t seem to last as long as the doctor said it would. Also the 5mg doesn&#039;t take the pain away. It does ease it a little. So on my next visit I will tell the doctor her calculation was off. Think I would do better on 20mg twice daily. Also if she could give me something else to advance my stool and make it softer. That pain is worse than the knee pain.""",9
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve used ambien for a couple months, probably 2 out of 3 days, and it works great.  It makes me able to fall asleep but doesn&#039;t knock me out.  It prevents me from waking up repeatedly for no reason, but I can still wake for a phone call.  I wake up in a shorter time feeling more refreshed than normal.

Bupropion,Depression,"""I was on citalopram 20mg and due to a death in the family, I was unable to get my prescription renewed before I ran out. So two months passed before I got to my doctor and I had done extensive research before making the decision to switch to Bupropion. I have been on it for 4 days now, and I definitely have the get-up-and-go that I never had before. I am beginning to enjoy the things I used to again.  HOWEVER, I am a serious coffee and sweet tea addict and for the first 3 days of use I had diarrhea and according to other people&#039;s reviews, it&#039;s actually quite common. I also was concerned because falling asleep is just a little more difficult but I still get 8 hours. I guess I&#039;m still adjusting to the idea of being normal and stable.""",5
Opana ER,Pain,"""Back pain 7 yrs ... Spinal Stenosis and Degenerative Disc ... Once I was prescribed Opana ER I was also prescribed a companion breakthrough medicine taken 4 x daily, these have been rotated every few mos. Dr. started Opana 10 ER 2 x daily, then Opana ER 20 twice daily. I&#039;m now on Opana ER 40mg twice daily.

I&#039;m seldom pain free but with Opana ER 40 and a breakthrough medicine I&#039;m more comfortable.  I can now stand and do tasks for short periods, then sit until the pain subsides.  This method has allowed me to cook, do laundry, raise tomatoes, etc.  I know that sounds limited but before I was pretty much chair bound.  NOW FEEL I HAVE MY LIFE BACK.

I finally had enough and went to the doctor in November 2016 and he told me it stopped working. So i got cheated a few months, but I like it so I do plan on replacing it. I did gain a little weight, but due to the fact that when I started it I was an athlete and now i&#039;m not, I don&#039;t really no how much of it has to do with the nexplanon.""",8
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""Are these outlandish reviews of whole years being forgotten solely due to Venlafaxine, actually serious? That seems ridiculously unrealistic.

I am on 225mg per day and if I&#039;m late taking a dose I get the weird zaps and dizziness etc. But it does do a pretty good job on very severe anxiety and depression.

Coming off it will be hard but I have been recommended a good 3-month plan for it. 

I have noticed that not all actual packs of tablets are as good as others though, I don&#039;t know how this can be!?""",7
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have been using this medication to treat severe pain in my feet that radiates up my legs, associated with Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome. As one who is not a fan of narcotics and how they make me feel totally drugged and out of it, this medication is completely free of side effects and adverse reactions when I have taken it. I&#039;m even able to drive, work and accomplish my daily acts of living without any impairment or restriction due to this medication. Lastly, this medication has allowed me to continue to work on my feet (OR RN) while I use several modalities to treat my condition.""",9
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I had a real rough patch of depression and over the last two years I went up from 180lbs to 275 lbs and seemed everything I tried failed.  at 5&#039;10&#039; I was diagnosed as obese, developed high blood pressure, pre-diabetic &amp; cholesterol was high. I couldn&#039;t exercise because I was so winded all the time.     Started on Saxenda November 9.  The goal is to introduce more physical activity as I start to drop the weight that&#039;s contributing to my being winded. 

I&#039;m now up to the 1.8 dose and in the first 18 days I am down 10 lbs.    Better food choices help too. 

Side effects: Slight nausea, fatigue/sleepiness and morning headaches. 

Insurance co considering entitlement because of the other comorbid factors. otherwise it&#039;s damn expensive.""",2
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I have been taking amitriptyline for about 9 years now. I always take 10 mg. I read there are people who take a very high dosage.
In a high dosage it does not work for insomnia but for depression. It is better to start with 10 mg.  When you start taking them you can have side effects, but these will disappear in time.
When you are very busy in your head, it is possible that it won&#039;t work that night. But don&#039;t give up. I take it about 2.5 hours before going to bed.
But don&#039;t use a high dosage, it won&#039;t work for your insomnia. It is an excellent pain killer as well, in a lower dosage. 
And with 10 mg it is very easy to stop taking it, I did that a couple of times  without any problems.""",0
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Had Implanon inserted in August 2009. Bled for over 2 months into Novemeber and have not had a period since. In the past week have experienced breast tenderness, nausea, lower back pain and slight dizziness which I worried was due to pregnancy. Have done 3 negative tests, however I feel slightly paranoid still and could swear I have a strange taste in my mouth normally associated with pregnancy but I hope it&#039;s just all in my head! Going to the doctors on Thursday so here&#039;s hoping I&#039;m not caught out in that tenth of a percent!""",8
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I am 20 years old and generally eat well and maintain an active lifestyle. I started using Loestrin 24 FE in April to deal with excessively heavy and irregular periods that started being a problem in January. In the three cycles that I&#039;ve been on it, I have gotten my period 6 times with irregular spotting in between, so it is not at all having the effects I was hoping for. Another complaint is that I&#039;ve gone from 130 lbs to 140 lbs with no significant changes in diet or activity.""",8
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I was so nervous to get this IUD when I read the reviews!  I had to try a birth control without estrogen due to aura migraines that I was getting.  The process was so simple!  I went in near the start of my period to ensure that the placement would be easier.  My doctor said that the insertion would feel like two small cramps (measuring) and one larger cramp (insertion).  To be honest, the measuring was more uncomfortable than the insertion.  Quick, painless, and three hours in, no bleeding or discharge.  I was able to go work out after 2 hours!  I do recommend taking the 4 ibuprofen before going though...I&#039;m sure that, that helped!  Do it!""",8
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I&#039;m extremley over weight with many many health issues so my doctor put me on belviq a couple of days ago. 10mg 2xday, so far it is going well. I noticed I&#039;m no longer craving sweets like I was. Here it is late night and have absolutely no desire to eat or snack. I used to be hungry all the time...this medicine seems to be working, also my insurance did not cover it so my doctor just sent in an override so my cost was $0. I&#039;m also in the 6 month  process of getting approved for gastric bypass surgery so looking foward to seeing how much weight comes off in a month.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am 43 years old, started 4 weeks ago at 186 lbs now at 171.  Sticking with a low calorie/low carb diet.  Getting in lots of cardio.  The pill isn&rsquo;t magic, it&rsquo;s been a lot of work losing, keeping track of foods, finding time to exercise and cook healthy meals for lunch and dinner.  The pill has curbed my appetite, helped with focus and motivation.  No side effects after first week (insomnia, dry mouth).  All around pleased with results but wonder if I could have done it without pills seeing as I stated, it&rsquo;s been a lot of work.""",3
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""This has to be the best medication (at least for me) for bipolar disorder, paranoia and anxiety. I have had bipolar episodes since my teens, now in my 30s and every time I have a bipolar episode, this medication almost works instantly, and what I mean by works instantly is snaps me out of my mania and unwanted thoughts quickly. It does take a few weeks to work fully but if you are someone who suffers from bad mania, this is the right medication for you. Luckily, I did not experience bad side effects from this medication. I have had some muscle stiffness in my neck, some twitching and muscle spasms and slight weight gain. Also, my menstrual cycle was thrown off. Also, it helped my somatic symptoms and I was able to live my life again A+++med""",6
Liletta,Birth Control,"""So, the insertion process for those who haven&rsquo;t went through it was extremely painful for me. I passed out twice but and the pain lasted two weeks but right now it&rsquo;s all good. I do like the freedom it gives me to have sex with my boyfriend without a condom. However recently I haven&rsquo;t been able to lose weight. I go to the gym for about an hour and a half a day and yet the weight is sticking to me like glue. Also I&rsquo;ve gained 4 pounds since I got it (three weeks ago). I don&rsquo;t like the weight gain at all and if it continues I might get it removed. That was a big worry for me when talking to my doctor and even though the IUD is a great form of birth control I&rsquo;m on a weightloss journey and this is causing a lot of issues.""",8
Sertraline,Depression,"""Zoloft has given me the last leap I need to heal my mind. I have been struggling with severe anxiety, insomnia and bouts of depression for 3 years. While I have been off work into therapy and other means of rehabilitation, for the first time in years I actually feel calmer most the time, and mostly happy. I&#039;m so grateful. It&#039;s been trial and error and a slow process, but I know my self-care is my main priority now. See more of my story:mental-health-matters-a-womans-story-of-the-struggle. Good luck to all.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I haven&#039;t weighed myself yet because I&#039;ve only been taking phentermine for 4 days now. I am starting to have the dry mouth, but my main concern is that the past 2 days I&#039;ve had off and on numbness/tingling in my left arm and left lower leg. I plan on calling my doctor tomorrow about it. It has me kind of nervous, but other than that I actually have more energy and I&#039;m not hungry at all.""",3
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""Started on Cymbalta for anxiety &amp; depression fall 2014. It was the first anti-depressant that I&#039;d ever tried (aside from St. John&#039;s Wort). Side effects during the first week of taking it were SO terrible that I had to stop. I was constantly dizzy. I couldn&#039;t focus on anything. It made my body so tense, I&#039;d catch myself clenching my teeth and fists. Insomnia was terrible; I&#039;d wake up ~5x per night. I work in healthcare and I felt like I couldn&#039;t do my job with all of these side effects, so I stopped. The side effects were really worse than my anxiety and depression. I have no doubt that they would have eventually decreased, but I couldn&#039;t wait for that to happen. Obviously, the side effects will be different for everybody but that&#039;s my story""",7
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""On 0.5 mg with 20mg escitalopram at day time and 0.5 mg clonazepam at sleep. Nice medicine and completely drives away my anxiety, especially the running heartbeat and sweaty palms  using also propranolol 20 mg, for social anxiety disorder and racing thoughts, would rate it 10 if my concentration in studying would not have decreased due to one of above mentioned medicines. Overall good, taking it since past 5 months.""",7
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I started experiencing depression and anxiety attacks at around 19 years old. At the time, I didn&#039;t quite realize what was wrong with me, I just knew something was horribly wrong. I have tried every medication known to man; celexa, Prozac, cymbalta, pristiq, viibryd, Wellbutrin... And nothing. The emptiness, emotional turmoil, and suffocation I felt was ruining my life. Then in 2011, I started Effexor. I feel alive again, and I never thought I would feel normal again. The one thing I will warn about is the dependency. If you miss one pill, you will think you are coming down with the flu. If you ever decide to stop, you will have to taper off. Adverse effects: constipation, weight loss, vivid dreams, insomnia, sexual dys.""",5
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I began taking buspar about six weeks ago. I am not a fan of benzos because they are addictive, I prefer to function with a clear head rather than popping a pill that sedates me so badly that maybe I&#039;m not feeling my anxiety, but I&#039;m also not living my life or doing much else either. Buspar has changed my life, I had completely forgotten what it was like to have a quiet mind until now. My obsessive thoughts subsided, I can leave my house without fear, I can speak to my friends and to strangers without profusely sweating and trembling, and I can drive again now that I&#039;m not so easily stimulated. It takes a few weeks to feel the full effect, so hang in there if you just began.""",7
Belviq,Obesity,"""I can say without reservation that this works. Start weight 246 lbs 5&quot;9 and end weight 202lbs so far in five months. It takes time and I work out as best I can but my goal will be accomplished in one year.
I find my appetite is easily managed as far as sweets, salty snacks etc. My appetite is fine as things taste good but no binges. Had a headache and now drink probably what I should have been doing all along. I consider this Belviq a nice aid to helping me with weight loss success. """,2
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""Been on belviq for a week now. Appetite has seriously changed. I basically eat cause I know I have to eat. I have NOT suffered from headaches like I did the first 2-3 days. Have not yet weighed myself but my starting weight was 187 lbs!! Will weigh when I finish my first months med.
I only was prescribed one per day so I take it around noon and it lasts me the entire day. I haven&#039;t been going to the gym yet but will restart again next week. I definitely notice a change in how my clothes fit I strongly recommend belviq to EVERYBODY.""",2
Topiramate,Obesity,"""Was given this due to daily headaches. I&#039;m not one to take pills so I started slow. One morning and one at night. Stayed like that for two weeks. I started exercising around that time also but only about 3times weekly and dieting pretty well but lost quite a bit of my appetite. I weighed myself and after two weeks I&#039;m down 15 pounds. I ate allot of yogurt and drank allot of coffee and water. That&#039;s all. I can&#039;t believe it was from this pill. I&#039;m More motivated then I ever was! Starting weight was 189. Now I&#039;m down to 174""",2
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I started Qsymia on Saturday, April 25th. I felt fine the first couple days but the last two days I&#039;ve got a weird feeling in my head and I feel a bit full, like I&#039;ve eaten too much but I haven&#039;t, leg cramps, slight tingling in my feet and itching in my hands (none of which are pleasant). It doesn&#039;t make me not want eat entirely but it definitely helps me make better choices. I&#039;ve had a touch of insomnia and some weird dreams and the weird feeling in my head kind of makes me want to give up but I hopped on the scale before I started typing this and I&#039;ve also lost 4 lbs so far (I&#039;m 41 years old, 5&#039;4&quot; and started at 206) I&#039;m going to call my doc tomorrow to be on the safe side. It appears to work but I&#039;m not sure I can continue on like this.""",3
Vicodin,Pain,"""I take Vicodin for menstrual cramps.  It is quite effective in eliminating the pain, but it does make me very sleepy and slightly out of touch with reality.  I found that caffeine counters this effect, but I haven&#039;t asked my doctor yet if it is okay to take caffeine with Vicodin (I read the warning label twice and didn&#039;t find anything mentioned there).  I haven&#039;t noticed withdrawal symptoms, but I do use a minimum amount and am not prone to addiction in general.""",9
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this pill for 4 months now and it&#039;s great. My period lasts only like 3 days on the sugar pills, experience barely any cramping. The only downside for my body was that this pill makes you spot on and off so I keep having to wear a panty liner and it makes me really emotional like I cry over everything and I was never that sensitive. I haven&#039;t gained that much weight but I will say it makes me have an appetite like a man! It cleared up my acne too. I do recommend this pill.""",8
Duragesic,Pain,"""I was put on Vicidin first for my chronic back pain, didn&#039;t work then the doctor said to try injections they worked for about a month. Then I got pain so bad I couldn&#039;t get out of bed 1/2 the time and my family doctor said he didn&#039;t want to give me anything stronger because of seizure medicines I was on. I tried everything for pain, then someone suggested pain management finally a doctor listened. He put me on the Fentanyl patch. I feel like I&#039;m 20 again. I can work, do things I couldn&#039;t do before with me kids and grandkids. This patch is a God send. I did experience heavy sweating and vomiting and dozing off till my body became adjusted. Now I still get the nodding off effect occasionally,  and itching where the patch is.""",9
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""Incredible medicine. Took maybe 4-6 weeks to kick in though, but when it did, WOW. I was having a panic attack every morning and was relying on a benzodiazepine to live a normal life. 

During the best of times, it has completely muted my anxiety. Sometimes I still get slightly anxious, but it&#039;s like the volume is turned way down. Have had maybe one &quot;panic attack&quot; (if I can even call it that, it was so mild) since it kicked in. 

I&#039;m happier, calmer, and more balanced. Only side effect was slightly disturbed sleep for 2 days when I started (and for a day or two after I increased the dose), and increased anxiety on the first day. I&#039;m on 15mg and I couldn&#039;t be happier.""",7
Taytulla,Birth Control,"""My experience with Taytulla was horrible and it&#039;s only been on my first week. I felt nausea about 2 hours after I took it and I noticed I had yeast infection. I never have it and I knew something was wrong. I read about it online and it does cause yeast infection as a side effect to some people. It was not a fun experience. I had it changed and the doctor has me on Orsythia, no problems so far!""",8
Belviq,Obesity,"""I have been on this med for a year, lost 7 pounds but the serotonin syndrome symptoms are not worth it.  I have had no energy, profuse sweating, high blood pressure and consistently high rate.  I have been off for 2 days.  I had trouble with sleep, episodes of crying, and exhaustion but my blood pressure is better andy heart rate is already in the 80s resting instead of 100s.  Tonight I feel better, though I have had a difficult ultimate 2 days. I hope the worst is over.  This drug is not worth the risk and side effects.  I&#039;m getting out of this clinical trial.""",2
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""I started Abilify on 2mg with Prozac and Klonopin. After just 3 days I felt the energy that was lacking for so many years. Before Abilify I had been on so many different antidepressants I felt there was nothing for me so I chose drinking. Wrong choice but it was the only thing that would make me feel normal. I finally quit with help from my family. I was put on Abilify, Prozac and Klonopin. I have now switched Prozac with Effexor 75 mg and Abilify 8 mg 4 mg in morning and 4mg at night 37.5 of Effexor in morning and night, also 2mg of Klonopin 2 times day or as needed.  I do suffer from vivid dreams and have gained a little weight but when I was drinking I wouldn&#039;t eat and lost a lot of weight. Overall it is a godsend.""",5
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""So I have always been a big girl! I have 3 kids and with each pregnancy there was added weight that just carried over and you know how the story goes...I pushed myself and my wants and needs to the side and took care of everyone but myself. The more weight I put on the more depressed I got. I got to 280lbs!!!! My body was in constant pain and discomfort and I knew I had to stop and do do something about it. I started the pills last year and lost a total of 125lbs!!! Not just the pills but I started the gym, did zumba 3 times a week and started eating good. The pills aren&#039;t the magic fix. They just help you kind of like a kick start. Sure I had side effects!!!! But nothing that would out weight being close to 300lbs.""",3
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Concerta makes you focused and and concentrated. If you wanna get stuff done you can get it done in a breeze. You won&rsquo;t notice that your enjoying what your doing, what I mean by that is like u know how homework is boring and especially if you have ADHD you have impulse problems, when you take concerta it&rsquo;s like when your doing it, time passes by a lot and you won&rsquo;t notice. Like you look at the time and for example it&rsquo;s 2:30 while your doing your homework like I said the time will be 4:00 when you look back at your phone""",1
Concerta,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been taking concerta for close to 15 years now since I was diagnosed at age 3. Around 8th grade I had started getting pain in my chest which was similar to costo condritis. The pain got increasingly worse up through highschool and the beginning of college around age 18 when it stopped affecting me as much. Now I&#039;m 21 years old (as of the 12th this month) and for the past years I&#039;ve been noticing that I&#039;ve been getting increasingly anxious and worrying more than usual. In the past 5years on a daily 63 mg dose I&#039;ve been dealing with depression, anxiety, nightmares, insomnia, loss of appetite, and I&#039;ve lost 30lbs due to that. It&#039;s effective, but at a price, sometimes one you can&#039;t afford.""",1
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I was recently put on Wellbutrin by the College&#039;s psychiatrist.  I just started it yesterday and I feel great.  The things that I used to dwell are not on my mind.  I woke up early this morning for work, and I never do that.  I smiled today and I feel like having new adventures and not concentrating on things that make me upset.  I am sure there will be better days to come and I am so excited.""",5
Viibryd,Depression,"""I was prescribed Viibryd for Major Depressive Disorder. Felt a little better after 2 weeks on the 30 day sample pack, but when I got up to 40 mg after 2 pills I started experiencing drug induced psychosis (heard a man&#039;s voice whispering one morning while I was alone, which I never had before), and also felt no emotions and felt floaty like nothing mattered. Then my doctor dropped me back down to 20 mg, generally I have been great around other people, but only recently in the past few weeks have I started feeling a heaviness in my chest like I feel like crying, and a constant feeling of being fat even though I exercise and eat regularly and only weigh around 135-139pds. I&#039;m not sure if the medication is working for me anymore.""",5
Propoxyphene,Pain,"""I was prescribed propoxyphene after having my first child, which went smoothly, but after complaining about my discomfort while in the hospital and nurses checking on me and my recovery. Everyone I had, said I was very swollen, after they started giving me propoxyphene I was much more comfortable. My doctor prescribed me some after I got home and it helped me take care of my new baby without any side effects.""",9
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I am 31 years old male and currently taking 100mg once a day. I have taken doxy 3 years ago for 4 months and it definitely worked like a miracle back then. I am glad my skin stayed fine for 3 years!! Sad part is..its back again! I never had any side effects especially if you are having plenty of fluids and not mixing with other supplements such as Iron and multivits tablets. In the beginning I felt as if my skin was more responsive to hot and cold temperatures but it&#039;s gone now. I would highly recommend doxy to all suffering from mild to severe acnes BUT you have to be patient to see it working!""",4
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""Been on this medicine for almost 2 years. Went to max dose of 60mg. Did NOTHING for my depression, anxiety, back pain, or Fibromyalgia. Completely useless medication. And whats worse? You got it- WITHDRAWAL. I have been to the ER 4 times now since withdrawing from 60mg down to 30mg, so I am only half way weened off as of now. Extreme vertigo, nausea, dizziness, brain zaps, edge of panic all day into night. Worst experience I have every had after trying different anti-depressants for the last 7 years. Gave this medicine the last chance. After I get off it, may take me a year or more to ween the rest of the way down.""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I have been taking lisdexamfetamine since end of May 2013 but for weight loss. I noticed during a 10 day period I had to go off of lisdexamfetamine how much it helped me focus and function. I completed daily tasks and projects I even went back to finish college. I learned through this that I have ADHD I never knew this before. I knew of learning disabilities and vision problems from grade school no one ever tested or diagnosed me with ADHD/ADD until now and I am mid 40&#039;s basically started life over again now. I have noticed that I do feel the medication wearing off starting about 2-3pm but more of the energy part of medication I seem to still be able to focus most days. I started a vitamin supplements in the afternoons now.""",1
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""Serious auto wreck crushed 2 discs in cervical area. Only options are surgical or meds. Out of 5 people who had surgery, 1 completely cured surgically. 3 said condition unchanged after long R&amp;R.Last one was in wheelchair due to small surgical error. That made up my mind. As long as meds control pain enough to live normal life(pretty much), I refuse to risk surgical procedure. Started with 3 30mg Oxycontin a day, did fairly well, but in line at pharmacy one day, said the word oxycontin too loudly, noticed three heads turned. I was afraid of being mugged on the way out. My doc suggested 30 mg Opana @2 a day, but had to increase to 40 mg@ 2Xdaily. With 4 10 mg IR for b/t pain, it is as good as it can be. I also take 3 mg xanax daily""",9
Dapsone,Acne,"""I have struggled with mild but persistent acne since I was 11 or so, and am now 21 and finally doing something about it! I am doing 3 things: Doryx (oral antibiotic), Retin-A micro at night, and Aczone mornings (and afternoons sometimes). I have seen huge improvement over the last 3 months, though not perfectly clear (mine is clearly hormonal and stress-related, so that&#039;s frustrating). Aczone doesn&#039;t dry out my skin and make it flake like other topical creams or gels (especially Benzaclin) and it makes my face feel smooth. Strangely, within the last week I have noticed some itchiness/dryness and peeling and I don&#039;t know why there is this change. I have been more consistent about putting it on twice a day instead of once, so maybe that&#039;s why""",4
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I had great success with this medicine at first.  I had/have the 10 mg pills.  When I started taking it, I would use it 3-4 times per week even though I could not fall or stay asleep on the other nights.  Now I take it every night along with Xanax for insomnia and that still doesn&#039;t do the trick.  My doctor added Trazodone 50mg to the mix. I still only get about 3-5 hours of sleep.  It takes till 5 or 6 in the morning for me to fall asleep. It is slightly better than nothing at all, all 3 of the medicine&#039;s combined that is.  I am beginning to feel like I will never sleep a good nights sleep.""",0
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I have been on 20mg of Lexapro and 0.5mg of Xanax for about 4 years. It wasn&#039;t until last year I have been vomiting for no reason every morning even if I wasn&#039;t doing anything. After avoiding food and drinks nothing helped so I talked to my doctor and he got me set up on this medicine. I&#039;ve never heard of it but for the past week I haven&#039;t thrown up since. I figured it was do to my anxiety when nothing helped and no I&#039;m not pregnant I&#039;m a male. Only downside for me is the drowsiness which like my other pills my body needs to get used to it first before I can actually function. All in all this medicine kept me from throwing up for about a week and I&#039;m happy for that.""",7
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I recently sought help from a psychiatrist and he prescribed me starter doses of Lamictal. He also gave me samples of Latuda for if I began to notice myself experiencing an episode. I noticed that I began to have a quick decline in to depression after a hypomanic state and reluctantly began to take the Latuda. It is AMAZING. After only 5 days of use, I already feel so much better.  Today  I just noticed that I am not depressed anymore, as I was a few days ago. I am able to take better care of my body (eating better, exercise) because I already am feeling so much better. I get very sleepy and some akathisia, I just take it at night to avoid those side effects.""",6
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I have been on this medicine for several years.  I have anxiety and Lexapro works really good but don&#039;t miss a dose or try to wean yourself off.  It makes you dizzy and you get these Zaps; to my tongue and down my arm.  I am still not off it and went back to my normal dose.  Beware of weight gain, I eat very health and get pretty good physical activity and the weight just keeps creeping up.  Good luck!  """,7
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have been taking 30mg of Vyvanse for one week now. It works great. The first day I could really feel the amphetamine and found it too strong and unpleasant but on day 2 I did not feel bad from it. It lasts long, probably 12-14 hours and is very smooth. The crash is relatively mild.
Previously I have been on dexamphetamine IR 3x10mg/day for one month which worked really well, but I wanted something that is sustained released. Before that I was on Ritalin IR and LA for over 15 years. The Methylphenidate just did not work as well as it used to and I found the side effects more and more unpleasant. 
I can really recommend Vyvanse so far. I am really calm from it and can focus very well on tasks. It also has less cardiac side effects than others.""",1
Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed in 1989. I was an 18 year boy at the time. After several years of miss diagnosis I was diagnosed in the mid 90&#039;s with bipolar disorder.

I got my life back I am now married, own my own home and have my own business. I am now were I want to be. The down side is I went from 180lbs to 240 lbs in 5 years.

I have been there and my 24 year old daughter still laughs at the things I have no memory of.. and I own several things I bought at 2 am.  

Finally two years ago I found a physician who took the time to explain how this medicine works and it changed everything.  You must be lying in bed, &quot;ready to go to sleep&quot;, with no lights on at all.  Ambien shuts down part of your brain and if you are not waiting to fall asleep lying in bed then after you take it the chemical reaction that allows you to fall asleep so easily also keeps you from remembering things you do. Take it properly.""",0
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""As a former gastric bypass patient,  I know all to well about the on going struggle to loose weight. I&#039;ve suffered many complications from this surgery and actually regret having it done. I&#039;ve gained roughly 60 lbs back of this original 130 I lost. After talking with my doctor she recommended belviq. I started taking belviq June 29, 2015. I weighed 240 and today I weigh 229.2. So that a total loss of 11 lbs in 3 weeks. I&#039;ve been walking AND running and have completely cut out fruit juices and eating rice every day. 

I will warn you that I didn&#039;t take the pill for 2 days due to being out of town, and I experiences the worst nausea and headaches. I actually became sissy in Walmart while shopping and had to sit down to gain my composure.""",3
Nucynta,Pain,"""I started Nucynta 100mg 3x/day because I have severe back problems. Norcos/Vicodin were not working. First day I was on it, it took about an hour to kick in (about 12am I got my prescription at 11pm). I had had bizarre/violent dreams. I took it before work (I didn&#039;t drive) and I have a desk job. I spent most of the day drooling. Day 2 great night sleep, no bizarre dreams fell asleep no problem. Went to work and was hot and sweaty (the office was at 69 degrees and it was raining), worst dry mouth you could imagine. No appetite and drank a ton of water. Day 3 diarrhea, sweaty, no appetite. As for the pain management it worked better than Vicodin but I still feel a burning.""",9
Intuniv,ADHD,"""Have been on intuniv for about a month now. I feel like I have been crawling out of my skin and emotionally very upset. I feel at times I could break down in tears over a commercial, or when my kids hug me and tell me they love me. I am normally a emotionally reserved man and keep them in check because of my line of work. I really do feel like I am going nuts on this medication. I have officially stopped taking the medication until I can talk with my doctor.""",1
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""Weight gain, lethargic 300 dosage at bed time, any more you&#039;ll have heads turning in public.

I tried college and it didn&#039;t work. My short term memory is short, can&#039;t even remember what I ate for dinner three days ago. I do sleep though. All you can do is push on and forget gl""",6
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started latuda 11 months ago (20mg, then 40, now 60), and I think all it does is trigger hypomanic episodes with dose increases and when those end I end up feeling more depressed than ever. The depressive episodes on latuda have been some of my worst in over three years, and the hypomanic episodes seem to last longer than usual. I also get ridiculously restless, having trouble falling asleep, but then having trouble waking up (I sleep through alarms for over an hour). I thought I found the drug for me, but I&#039;ll be seeing my psychiatrist soon to switch. At least it worked well for awhile?""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had paraguard for four years and experienced very bad cramps during ovulation and my period, along with heavy bleeding.  I switched to Mirena after consulting with a new GYN.   The removal of paraguard was painless and took less than a second.  The original insertion of it was extremly painful.  I had it inserted when I was in my late 20s, no children.  I still have no children and found the insertion of the Mirena to be no worse than two bad cramps, each lasting only a second.  I took 800mg of Motrin about an hour prior to the precedure, which may have helped.  I had no cramping or spotting after the procedure and have still have no cramping or spotting.""",8
Ketorolac,Pain,"""I had come down with a very bad sinus infection that caused me to have a migraine like headache.  It was extremely unbearable.  So I had my spouse take me to the emergency room and the doctor gave me a shot in the rear and within seconds I felt immense relief.  The next day the headache came back and after eight hours of dealing with it, I went back to the ER and got another shot.  It was fabulous and it allowed me the ability to keep down my antibiotic so I could kick the sinus infection.  I don&#039;t know why they don&#039;t make an injection pen for Migraine sufferers to keep around.  Worked way faster than Imitrex ever did for me in the past.""",9
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I received this medication in the ER for kidney stones.  Twice before the ER had given me Demerol for this pain and while it helped it did not completely give me relief.  THIS did! I do not know if it caused nausea or not, because they gave me Zofran along with it.  I know that if I am ever in severe pain again I hope the doctor will give me this medicine.  Also I had no memory loss like I do with morphine, which is a plus.  I only received it through IV.""",9
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""After years and years of self medicating and over medicating on co- codamol. Chewing ibupufren, even nasal surgery to relieve severe sinus pain I was prescribed amatriptyline 10mg at night. Immediately, or at least the next morning, after the best nights sleep I&#039;d had in years, the pain was GONE !! It became apparent, though, after a few weeks that my sex drive had also GONE!! What a dilemma for a 45 yr old, normally virile bloke. If I&#039;m honest, after all the years of pain and worry I&#039;d had over taking so many pain killers, it was a small sacrifice to make. Unfortunately, my partner didn&#039;t see it in the same light, understandably...Oh well ?""",9
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I was taking 60mg of restoral at night for about 2 years.  I would take Zoloft during the day to help with a PTS disorder.  My doc. Recently changed my sleep aid to trazodone 50-100mg a night, I have never had a better nights sleep in my life, the main thing that worked for me was to dim the lights and lay down about 20 minutes after taking trazodone, within 10 minutes I was asleep.  Woke up without being groggy all day, no longer need a nap after work or during breaks at work.  I have taken ambien, miritzapam, zanex, Tylenol p.m.,Advil p.m. restoral, all to wake up feeling out of it the whole day.  Trazodone works well for me, been 7 months with the same results every night 6-7 hours of sweet dreams.""",0
Topamax,Bipolar Disorde,"""I tried EVERY medication out there, I swear. It has always ended badly, bad side effects, bad combinations, etc. And because of that I have been more against taking meds. Once we finally figured out that depression wasn&#039;t my problem, and I was diagnosed with a mood disorder (unofficially Bipolar II since I&#039;m still not 18), I&#039;m finally on 75mg of Topamax, 20mg of Prozac, and then I take Adderall XR 30mg and Adderall normal 10mg and this combination has had any positive effect, without any negative side effects. I do think I have suffered from the side effect of memory loss and slow thinking, not enough to make me stop taking it though. It has helped me so much and I recommend to anyone who is having trouble finding medicines that work for them.""",6
Copper,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had mine in for 4 months and I am getting it removed next month. I&#039;m really bummed this didn&#039;t work for me as I have tried many of the hormonal types of birth control and discontinued because I always endured terrible side effects. I decided to discontinue this because the cramping I have is becoming unbearable. I have cramping 3 out of 4 weeks and I have to take 4x 800mg ibuprofen. Before I had my period for 3-4 days and would have bad cramping for one day that could be fixed by taking 1-2 500mg tylnenol tablets.""",8
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been on vyvanse for about 2 days now and I can&#039;t believe the difference from the other two medications I&#039;ve tried. (Adderall and Focalin) I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago, I was not diagnosed when I was younger, which would&#039;ve have really explained a lot.  First I tried adderall, it didn&#039;t do much but make me a bit irritable, and still not focusing was on 50mg a day 30mg in the morning and a 20mg in the afternoon, and I didn&#039;t notice a thing. Next was the generic of Focalin, which dild absolutely NOTHING! With vyvanse I feel like I can concentrate on one thing at a time, and not have the urge to start 10 other things.  My doctor put me on 70 mg in the morning, it&#039;s a bit of a slow start, but once it doesn&#039;t its a very productive""",1
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I felt it necessary to leave a review because of how well this medication has worked for me.

However, I have been quite seriously bipolar (with panic disorder) for over 30 years. As you can imagine I have been on many medications. About two years ago nearly everything had gone wrong in my life - including being homeless and drinking far too much. I pulled out of that with the help of Seroquel. But I was still having really really bad times. Then I met someone who suggested this medication.

Well it was not instant but slowly I started becoming &quot;normal&quot;. Normal to me is wonderful. Now I hardly drink.. Why - because I drank to cure myself.. I actually wake up and look forward to the day. I feel young again!""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am 20 yrs old and I have been taking Vyvanse for about 2 years now ...I take 60mg about the same time each morning and it really does wonders in helpig me concentrate and getting everything done both at home and school. I&#039;ve noticed a BIG difference in myself on the days I do take it and on the days I don&#039;t. Only side effects are the loss of appetite, headaches from not eating (from the loss of appetite), dry mouth, irritability and now I have depression.. Don&#039;t know if I should lower my dosage now or maybe it&#039;s from another cause.""",1
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I am a college student and I have to say this is by far the best ADHD medication I have taken. I was taking Adderall XR prior and was having major anxiety attacks/mood swings and just never really adjusted to it, so my doctor switched me to Concerta. It has helped me tremendously, I am finding it so much easier to focus and complete tasks, I have gone from C&#039;s to the deans list over the last year. I feel no side effects, I take the extended release medication early in the morning so it lasts all day but does not interfere with my sleep patterns. I would recommend this medication, it has worked wonders for me!""",1
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Wonder drug for me. I have been on and off 10 mg Lexapro for 5 years. Went through withdrawals while weaning myself off through the beginning of 2 pregnancies. Withdrawals feel like you are coming down with something and the world is a scary unknown new place. Brain zaps are weird too. But I went back on the medication after giving birth because I truly am the text book person with generalized anxiety disorder. It consumes every part of my life. I was just upped to 15 mg a week ago because the 10 was just not quite doing it for me anymore. Life has thrown some serious medical conditions our way. My son was diagnosed with cancer, as was my father, and my other son has down syndrome so my anxiety really spiked. The 15 mg has been wonderful.""",7
Oxtellar XR,Bipolar Disorde,"""This is a cleaner way of taking trileptal, it really does make both medication management and the side effects easier to manage. On generic trilepetal I needed to medicate twice daily &amp; the morning dose really put me in a fog, not to mention how intense the headaches could get about 30 minutes after my 3x evening dose. Now the headaches still come but are far less intense &amp; the onset is hours later. Also, the lethargy factor is greatly reduced, I take 900 mg.
@ 6 PM &amp; I&#039;m ready for bed at 10:30, not focused on getting to my pillow all night like I was previously.  This medication does interfere with my ability to urinate within 2 hours of taking it. As for the positives, I&#039;m a rapid-cycler &amp; days are most certainly more stable. Give it time""",6

I didn&#039;t know what was going on and it got to the point where I couldn&#039;t move, walk or sit. I went to the dr and had blood drawn and a urinalysis. Both tests came back normal so the dr ordered an pelvic ultrasound. I had the ultrasound on March 2, 2016 just to be told that my iud not only moved but it broke. Part of it is poking my uterus and that&#039;s the pain and the other part is in there somewhere.  Well tomorrow March 3rd I will be having surgery to remove it. Hoping that she only has to remove it and doesn&#039;t have to do a hysterectomy. This is the worst experience ever and hopefully they ban this iud""",8
Strattera,ADHD,"""This drug does help me calm down and focus (it also really helped me with my anxiety) but the side effects of vomiting, feeling like I don&#039;t care about the world and my head is squished in, and ultimately my inability to stay awake throughout the day left me asking my doctor for a change of medication. For reference, this was my first medication used to manage my adult ADHD and I started on one pill for three days and was moved up to two and these side effects worsened with two pills.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""Started this medication on 11/3 and I&rsquo;m down 21lbs. My problem is definitely psychological/mental and Contrave appealed to me because it helps with the chemical levels in your brain. Started seeing a change on the second day. Not wanting the junk food and not as much. Was automatically choosing healthier food not even thinking about it. Was satisfied with having healthy foods and not feeling deprived. Also gave me the want to exercise and not feel like I had to drag myself to the gym. Did see the &ldquo;effectiveness&rdquo; of it wear off as I got closer to upping the dose which concerns me that after hitting the 4 pills a day I&rsquo;m gonna stall out.

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Seraquel for 10 years of varying dosage until finding the right balance of this medication. 

It cured my insomnia and dampened the racingthoughts. Very happy with it for those reasons. 

However. I feel very dizzy and tired around an hour after taking 350mg at night. 

It levels out the mood swings. 

Curbs  feelings of elation and empathy. Which is quite a price  to pay for steady moods.

To conclude, Seraquel has had a very positive influence in the treatment of Bipolar Disorder. I think of it as preventative medication that &quot;quietens&quot; the mind. (Hence Quetiapine - it&#039;s pharmaceutical name).""",6
Xenical,Obesity,"""It&#039;s been amazing....  I lost 15lbs the first two months, I&#039;ve continued taking it and average 2-3 lbs loss every month. My heaviest weight was 205 and as of my last weight check, I&#039;m at 165 and dropping. At the beginning I was doing a lot of exercise which I think helped a lot, now it&#039;s colder and I&#039;m pretty satisfied where I&#039;m at so I&#039;ve slowed down, but I do believe that the side effects and results have made managing weight so much easier.  I&#039;ve turned a few friends on to it and they are just as big a believer as me. Trust me the side effects are worth it!""",2
Zoloft,Depression,"""I am in my early 50s.  The &quot;docs&quot; gave me this med initially for &quot;stress&quot;.  I was referred to a &quot;psychiatrist&quot; right after &amp; I complied.

I took the medication as prescribed (25mg), &amp; had to endure 1 week of agony, but figured it was part of &quot;the drug&quot;.  I had muscle twitches, sweating, hot/cold sensation was thrown off, Blood pressure would shoot up &amp; drop low, NO SLEEP at all for 1 week, before the &quot;medication&quot; took hold.

My skin is almost as clear as it was years ago when I was on Accutane.  Pretty much no side effects as of yet (knock on wood).  I&#039;ve been on every medication possible and nothing worked.  Finally I went to a new dermatologist who prescribed spironolactone and I wish I would&#039;ve found this sooner.  I rarely get a pimple now and the only one that I have gotten has been really tiny and has gone away after a day.   I hope the success continues.""",4
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been through so many medications it&#039;s ridiculous... most of them didn&#039;t work AND caused severe side effects. The last one I was on before Depakote was lamotrigine (which really is better for bipolar II, from what I understand). I tend to run very manic (and don&#039;t have a thyroid anymore - cancer), so my doc and I decided this would probably be my best option. None of the new drugs worked on me. Depakote has been amazing. I can think a lot more clearly and I&#039;m still me - just a lot more toned down. I&#039;ve had no negative side effects except a slight tremor, but I&#039;m also on xanax for severe anxiety, so its only noticeable when it&#039;s time for that. No weight gain, either. In fact, my appetite decreased. I haven&#039;t gained or lost, really.""",6

Then my back pain got worse.  Further tests show that I have degenerative disc disease on another part of my back, scoliosis, arthritis and a herniated disc. My doctor prescribed Oxycontin 20 mg every 12 hours, with the Lortab for breakthrough pain.  It has saved my life.  I no longer lie in bed trying to convince my body to get moving.  I hate that there is so much stigma and abuse of this medication, because for those who truly need it, it&#039;s a life saver!

I&#039;m diabetic and my sugar is a bit elevated but I&#039;ve been able to adjust insulin for that.  I sleep like a baby all through the night now but my feet, ankles and calves are so swollen, I can barely walk.  I can&#039;t believe that I&#039;ve developed this edema and I think I&#039;m going to have to go off the medicines.  Too painful.""",6
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Buspar 10mg 3 times a day for the past 3 months for anxiety and panic attacks. I think for the most part my panic attacks have subsided but still experience a bit of anxiety and increased blood pressure. I do take Xanax 0.25mg from time to time if my anxiety gets too bad or too stressed. I do notice I feel slightly lethargic and run down most of the time while I have been on this. Also after each dose I get some dizziness about 45 minutes afterwards which lasts for about 45 minutes or an hour. I used to have a spark to me before taking it, but I guess I&#039;ll take the good with the bad for the time being.""",7
Tramadol,Pain,"""I got put on tramadol today for pain in my back after falling on the ice and hitting the cement stairs in front of my house. About ten minutes after I took it my back felt a lot better. I was not sleepy and I am able to function and get things done while taking this medication. It helps tremendously and I strongly recommend it to anyone who has to take care of children. This works because you don&#039;t feel &quot;out of it&quot;.""",9

I experienced some of the worst mood swings EVER freaking out &amp; feeling out of control of my body and emotions. Even my family was telling me to stay away from them.

He&#039;s still depressed so it&#039;s not really helping him. He&#039;s like dr. Jekyl &amp; Hyde. He  will snap 1 minute then the next minute he&#039;s talking very nice as if nothing happened or he didn&#039;t remember saying anything mean. It&#039;s been a roller coaster I think I would rather have him not on anything or prescribed medical marijuana for his anxiety &amp; to help him relax. I don&#039;t know what the right answer is. Maybe we will find something in the near future to help.""",5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Have been taking Ambien as needed for about a month. It&#039;s worked almost flawlessly and very reliably each time I&#039;ve taken it, and I&#039;ve experienced no negative effects. It&#039;s a very calm, peaceful transition into sleep.

 Insertion definitely hurt, but if you take some ibuprofen prior to it the pain shouldn&#039;t leave you too miserable. I already had really heavy, painful periods so my first period on it was a special sort of hell. I also had weird, intermittent spotting and cramping for the first 2-3 months, but by March things started to lighten up. Cramps can now be treated with an  in-pants heating pad and my flow is but a trickle. I reckon my period will stop altogether within the next few months.

Citalopram,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for about 2 months now and my life is completely different.  I have been struggling with depression on and off for about 14 years now.  It was getting really bad for me, I was at the point where I couldn&#039;t control my emotions at all.  It made me very drowsy at first, but that subsided after a couple of weeks.  I feel so much better inside and people around me can tell a distinct difference too.  I like the fact that it doesn&#039;t make me emotionless, just that my emotions aren&#039;t so strong and out of control.  I still get sad, but that is a normal human emotion.  I am so thankful that there are ways to make people like me feel better.  Depression is a disease, not a choice.""",5
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""As of today, August 30, 2011 I&#039;ve been taking Adipex for exactly one week and I&#039;ve lost 9 pounds. I think it works wonders aside from the cotton mouth, restlessness, and jitters. It also gives me an extra little push of energy. I love it. I&#039;m eating healthier, drinking plenty of water and taking the stairs now instead of the elevator. I haven&#039;t even done any strenuous exercise. I love love LOVE it!""",3
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Silenor every night for 5 months and love it.  It doesn&#039;t knock me out or make me loopy like Ambien.  Silenor just makes me a bit drowsy, but more importantly is that when I wake up in the middle of the night I fall right back to sleep - which is a lifesaver for me. Since it&#039;s non-addictive, this is great for just normal calm times in my life, which is 95% of the time.  But when I&#039;m stressing out over something and all panicky, then Silenor does practically nothing for me.  I have to take Ambien or Ativan during that 1-2 week period I&#039;m stressing.""",0
Celexa,Depression,"""I have suffered from anxiety/depression since I was a teenager. I have tried various medications, but I have never stayed on anything too long because they always made me feel like a zombie or the side effects were worse than the symptoms. Celexa really gave me my life back. My racing thoughts and manic mood swings are long forgotten. I have never had any side effects while taking Celexa, but when I stop taking it (i.e. waiting for refill prescription), I crash pretty hard. I can&#039;t sleep, have HORRIBLE restless leg syndrome (which I use to swear was made up), and anxiety 10 fold. Other than that, its amazing, and it completely gives me back my normal self.""",5
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on this for about 6 months when I was 15. It&#039;s the only thing that has worked for me. I was able to go to school. Had great relationships with everyone. Only had one bad mood swing and I was having them everyday before I got on it. But I also gained 20 pounds and I could never get enough to eat. I&#039;ve tried about everything and this was the only thing that helped. It doesn&#039;t make you feel funny or blank like a lot of them. But if you eat healthy and can ignore the always wanting something to eat feeling, this is an amazing medicine and will change your life.""",6
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""I have been on the generic version of Wellbutrin XL since July 1, 2015. It took about a week for me to notice any change but it was definitely for the better.

I haven&#039;t experienced any negative side effects and have actually lost 30lbs since I started taking it. Overall, I am doing much better now that I am on Wellbutrin.""",5
Pristiq,Anxiety,"""I am a 19 year old female. I have been using Pristiq for over 3 weeks now. The first couple of days were pretty intense for me, I was very jittery, had a constant feeling of a ball being in the back of my throat, and was constantly thirsty. My second week was great, I started seeing very positive results. Pristiq really suppresses my appetite, but I&#039;ve only lost a couple of pounds. Constipation is also another thing to be prepared for. I take it in the morning and it boosts my mood. I am also taking clonazapem for the night time. I would recommend this medication for people with mood disorders, but You have to be patient to see results. The first couple of days might frighten you a little, but be patient and see how you feel after a couple of weeks.""",7
Phentermine,Obesity,"""MARIE501

I wanted to share my first day on Phentermine. I weighed myself this morning at 225.8. I am a diabetic Type 2 and my A1C levels are 13.3! Yikes. I tried the Low Carb High Fat diet and it worked. I lost 8 lbs in week, but it was extremely difficult to continue.

How I feel: This morning after taking pill, I could barely eat! I feel weak, but also energized (weird). I am having dry mouth, but not severe, and blurred vision. Im extremely excited to see how this works for me. Hopefully the diet treats me well. 

Tips: Make sure you start on like a Thursday or Friday or weekend, that way you can experience the symptoms at home rather than work.

Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I am a 27 year old 5&#039;2 women. My weight started at 242lbs on March 1st. I lost 8lbs in a month teaching myself how to eat right. I just went to the doctor on April 21st and he gave me Adipex for 30 days. I started taking it on the 22nd and today is the 25th and I have lost 7lbs in 4 days. I do have dry mouth, nausea, headache at night and have trouble sleeping. I don&#039;t have that burst of energy I hear so many talk about. I have not started working out yet, but tonight I will start that. I too do not crave sweets and I also am a huge coke drinker and I haven&#039;t wanted one since I started. All I want is water and that&#039;s a good thing. This is my first time taking Adipex and so far I am very happy with it.""",3
Vilazodone,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking it for over a year.  I have taken Lexapro before, but it stopped working.  I take 40 mg a day, I take mine in the morning. I have to say that I still have a burning in my stomach, and night sweats, but I absolutely love this medication. It&#039;s the best. I feel more myself. I don&#039;t have hateful outbursts, I don&#039;t yell at my boys, and I love the way I feel.  So thankful my doctor tried me on this.""",5
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""The idea of this is great. I got mine put in on July 24,14 &amp; taken out Jan 19,15. I get sick with pill birth control &amp; recently moved to Florida so I got it put in. I had no bleeding for 2 months then all of a sudden it never stopped. I was miserable and depressed with always bleeding and never being able to be intimate. I have friends with great experiences but this wasn&#039;t the case for me. They put me on birth control pills to help the bleeding it helped until the pills ran out. Ultimately after 2 months of constant bleeding I went in to a different doctor becuase I&#039;m now out of the state I got it put in just for a consultation and she immediately offered to take it out.""",8

Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Right before and after getting the nexplanon I would lose sleep over reading the reviews on here. I am on a year long traveling trip and my doctor told me this would be the best option. After reading all the horrifying reviews I vowed that if I had a good experience I would come back and share since usually unhappy customers are more likely to write reviews. I think it really just depends on your body. For me so far it&#039;s been about two months and I&#039;ve had zero side effects except for the fact that it took away my periods completely which exactly what I needed. Praise God! I am grateful.""",8
Bupropion,Anxiety,"""I was on the generic form of Prozac 20mg for anxiety/headaches for about 6 months. During the first few months I worked out at least 3 times a week &amp; didn&#039;t notice a difference in my weight loss I became frustrated with it. I also felt like I needed more help, well Once my dr increased my dose I maybe worked out once a week &amp; the weight piled on. I was always sleeping and didn&#039;t feel like doing anything. I went and saw my dr &amp; told her to take me off this bc it wasn&#039;t working and the weight gain was awful 20 pounds in 2-3 months. I started Budeprion XL 150 mg once a day. today is my third day and I already feel that im not as hungry, I have way more energy, last night I felt like I was drifting in &amp; out sleep, may need meds to help sleep""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien every night for a over 20 years. I am a nurse and it&#039;s very difficult to work swing shift and teach yourself to sleep whenever ..esp if you suffer from insomnia. I have had insomnia since a child, probably sleep walking. Sleep eating prior to taking the medicine. Now that I have it ..my life has improved 200 percent .No one can imaging how disturbing it is to lie in bed for 8 hours wide awake ...knowing you have work soon. When I first took it, I was groggy in the morning ..but now as long as I get 8 hours I wake up feeling awake and amazing ..never grew a tolerance for it. Always works. I will say when I had children under 5 ..I would never take it ...not safe ..when you are caring for others .this med saved me.""",0
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Today is November 17, and I just finished my second week using saxenda. It has sure been a life saver for me. I have dieted with every diet out there, lost a few pounds, but always hungry and always felt I was giving up the foods I love. I am a food addict, no doubt about that. I eat when I a happy, I eat when I am sad, I eat just to eat. I think of food 24/7. This medication has helped me with this. I still think about food, but I don&#039;t obsess about it, and I still eat what I want, but in much less amounts. I am down 6 pounds, and excited to see how this goes. I will be going up to 1.8 this week.

Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""Why would you prescribe someone with acne this medication to clear it up if it only makes it so much worse? I had a few pimples and black heads and now I&#039;m covered in all sorts of acne including cystic and white heads all over my face. I&#039;ve cried a lot and have been so embarrassed and I&#039;m just now realizing from these reviews that it&#039;s a trend to have horrible acne from taking these pills. No idea what I should do about it now except to spread the news to people that are thinking about taking this pill to not waste your time   I and apparently so many others have suffered.""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""0, zero, Nada. No weight loss. Been on it for 5 wks. Expensive wasted money. Maximum dose is 4 tablets daily. That should tell you something. If you have to take so many pills, be on diet, and exercise why take these. Just diet, exercise and buy over counter medicine. Stated at 230 lbs 5 weeks later still  230lb. Company will still profit at one month supply from each person taking this. LET&#039;S SEE IF THEY POST THIS""",2
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Started June 24, 2017 - on my 4th week. Dose 1.8.
Down 10lbs. Age 59, 6&#039;2&quot; started at 300lb - now 290.  Expected faster loss as I tend to lose quickly on diets ( but it comes back). Weigh Daily - notice up and down swings of 5. to 1 lb some days. Walk 3 miles a day under 40 minutes. Side effects - nausea, some fatigue - especially in afternoon.  Body is adjusting to drug slowly. Absolutely no hunger whatsoever.  Eating smaller portions and adjusting diet.  Cravings for sweets and carbs have subsided.""",2
Fetzima,Depression,"""I too have experienced a lot of loss especially with my divorce.   I started up on the Fetzima recently and I&#039;m experiencing fairly persistent symptoms of nausea.  I was at 40 mg, but I&#039;m finding that I am having to titrate, because I just can&#039;t take the effects of the nausea.   I&#039;m trying to stick it out, perhaps go down to 20 mg a day and see where I&#039;m at at this point.   I&#039;ve also tried many medications, and I&#039;m feeling extremely frustrated and somewhat hopeless.   Have other people had similar experiences on this medication as far as getting over the hump of nausea?  There just doesn&#039;t seem to be a lot of options.""",5
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I have been using buspirone (Buspar) along with Cymbalta for depression and anxiety for about 2 years now.  It did take a while to get my regimen figured out as far as how much to take and when to take it, but now that I take it regularly and consistently, my life has changed.  The side effects were horrible at first, including stomach aches and severe dizziness, but they have mostly subsided.  I take mine with food in the morning, and if I&#039;m having an extra stressful day, I can take one in the afternoon or evening.  It definitely calms my nerves.  I feel normal again instead of in a cloud of depression and anxiety.  It may not work for everyone, but it has worked for me and I will continue taking it.""",7
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I have suffered from depression for about 2 years now. Crying all the time, getting my feelings hurt real easily, getting mad, then happy, then back to mad. Tried Lexapro and it didn&#039;t work. Tried Pristiq and it made me feel ten times worse. I started on this medication yesterday and I already feel a little better. I am hoping that I have finally found the answer! If this has already made me feel this good after one dose, I can&#039;t wait to see what happens after I have taken it for a while! I recommend this to anyone definitely!""",5
Accutane,Acne,"""I live in the Uk so we get drugs etc free. This drug is only available via a specialist at a hospital and is carefully mointored. I&#039;m 40yrs old and had painful large sports since I was 12, I have tried everything, so now I&#039;ve hit 40 and had a family decided to try it. I lasted 15 days of 20g a day. I thought at my age I would have less to worry about that a teenager. I could cope with the dry skin and cracked lips but the headaches and joint pain was horrific. I stopped taking 5 days ago but still am in constant pain &amp; have a headache have been told these side effects could last up to 30 days. I have never suffered side effects from any drugs I have taken until I took this. If you are planning to take this please consider carefully.""",4
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I was switched from Xanax to Klonopin for anxiety by my doc because the Xanax was just making me feel ill and nauseated.  The Klonopin is doing the same thing.  I feel even more lethargic, weak, nauseated and tired during the day.  The initial prescription is .25 per nite before bed.  Since I wake up with the anxiety each morning, my doc agreed I could take it in the morning.  On Mother&#039;s Day I had to take 2 pills and still didn&#039;t calm me down...for no reason!  I had a great day planned and still had anxiety.  I think after all these rave reviews I&#039;ll try it before bed again and see what happens in the morning.  I just want to feel GOOD again!""",7
Lidocaine,Pain,"""really no idea if the medicine works or not because they do not stick. If you can lay on your stomach for 12 hours and not move then maybe you can figure out if they work. I cut one in half, stuck in on my low back, got in bed and 5 minutes later I feel something I am laying on. I reach down and pull out something that looks like a French fry only to learn it is my pain patch that lasted a total of 5 minutes. I put the other half on and sat down to type this review and when I got up out of my chair, it was all rolled up..PITIFUL, PITIFUL PRODUCT. I AM RETURNING IN AM FOR A FULL REFUND...DO NOT BUY THE MYLAN LIDOCAINE 5% PATCH....NOT WORTH $5.00 MUCH LESS $200+.. DON&#039;T BUY IT....""",9
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been Bi polar for over 20 years and have tried practically every mood stabilizer and antidepressant there is and some would work for awhile then poop out. Saphris is like a miracle medicine. I don&#039;t feel depressed, I have more energy and motivation and my moods are stable. I take one 10 mg tab at bedtime and wake up the next morning feeling alive and ready for the day. I would encourage anyone who is suffering from bipolar depression and mood swings to give this medicine a try. You won&#039;t be disappointed.  One caveat though is without insurance it is very expensive.""",6
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Started Saxendra on Tues. July 25th. 46 years old, 5&#039;6&quot; starting weight 201lbs. 
Starting dose 0.6. Was still hungry and craving sugars and bad snacks. 
Upped dosage for second week to 1.2
Day 3 of 1.2 mg huge headache with nausea/vomiting. Had to come home from work. 
On Monday I tweaked my neck backing up a trailer at the boat launch. So, I&#039;m attributing the vertigo and nausea to that?
I went for a chiropractic adjustment today for my neck. I guess we&#039;ll see if that is the cause of my nausea.  Could be the drug, could be the tweak? 
Since I&#039;ve upped the dose to 1.2 I&#039;m not hungry at all and nothing seems to be appetizing. Forcing myself to eat something. 
the &quot;off switch&quot; in my brain  to tell me when I&#039;m full finally works!!!!""",2
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I only took Bontril 105mg for 2 months. I started out at 250lbs!!! I went to buy New clothes and was in a size 18, so depressing! I started out on Bontril 35mg, that did nothing for me so they bumped it up. I did stop drinking cold drinks, and only water. I did not even drink tea. I ate a high protein diet, beef jerky, cheese, and yogurt. They told me 1200 calories but that felt impossible! I did exercise the first month but slacked in the second. I lost 50 pounds total in those 2 months.  There after I did not gain my appetite back and got all the way down to 162 pounds. This medicine is absolutely amazing! Its been over 2 years and I just starting gaining some of the weight back due to the depo shot, I will definalty be going back to Bont""",2
Lexapro,Depression,"""I have been taking Lexapro for about 3 months.  I started off taking 10mg per day but I felt like it wore off throughout the day and my energy level would drop.  My doctor upped the dosage to 20mg and I definitely noticed a difference - my mood doesn&#039;t drop during the day.  I don&#039;t feel sad, I can actually concentrate now.  I haven&#039;t had any side effects, in fact it&#039;s even helped me sleep better.  As for the anxiety, I think it is helping because I&#039;m not as worried about everything all the time but I still feel very stressed out in social situations.  I&#039;m in therapy as well so that might help me learn to control the fear.  Life shouldn&#039;t feel so dire and impossible.  Lexapro helped me see this.""",5
Copper,Birth Control,"""Hi, I&#039;m 28 yrs old and got 3 kids already. I&#039;ve had the IUD for about a year now, and I&#039;d have to say that personally it has worked wonders for me. 
I&#039;d encourage women who have had the IUD inserted to got for an ultrasound at least twice a year. 
I had my second scan last week and the device is still intact where it should be, with no abnormalities found.
Yes I did experience cramping a few days after it was inserted, by after that I did not experience any complications.
Although I don&#039;t think it should be recommended for all women, I really depends on how each individual reacts to the method and whether or not she is comfortable with it.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I just started taking this pill today. I ate breakfast and drank 24oz of water before I took this pill. I didn&#039;t want to feel sick and have any side effects because I didn&#039;t eat first. I didn&#039;t not exercise today or eat good, I wanted to see how the pill made me feel before I start eating good and exercising ( which I will do tomorrow). I am early 20s 5&quot;2 SW: 169.4lbs; GW: 130lbs - 120lbs. I have been over weight for 7 years since having my daughter. It&#039;s time I get my body back. Throughout the 7 years I lost weight and gained it back. I have good energy levels after taking it. My shoulder hurt some, maybe it&#039;s the way I sit. Hopefully it stops. I gave it 5 star cause it Day 1. I will update in about 2 weeks!""",3
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve taken contrave because when I took the first pill,a few hours later I had the worst headache but I had read and understand the side effects. I continued until day 4 and the headaches got worse. My hands were shaking,I had lost my appetite completely. Being that I work in pharmacy both the pharmacist an technicians expressed their concerns from the moment I decided to fill my prescription. I just kept on getting this bad feeling during those 4days I had taken contrave. I later come to find out that contrave controls some of your brain function that sends signals to your stomach so it thinks you have no appetite. But while its doing that to your nuero functions it can also cause you to have seizures. I hate this,medication, never again.""",2
Belviq,Obesity,"""So far Belviq is AMAZING. I did the 15 day trial offer. I started the medication on Feb 10, 2014. My starting weight was 252lbs. Today is Feb 25th, 2014. The 15th day, end of trial and I weigh 234lbs! That is 18lbs dropped in 15 days. I&#039;ve changed my eating habits, drink plenty of water, I am not exercising too much around 3x a week by walking. 
I have experienced no side effects whatsoever. My appetite is truly decreased, I do eat healthy but not big portions like I used to and I get full pretty quickly. Going to pick up the rest of the medication at the pharmacy. I have to pay out of pocket for the rest of the medication but it is truly worth it!""",2
Differin,Acne,"""FP prescribed this to me while I was on waitlist for dermatologist... I&#039;ve used this for 7 months now. I still have a lot of acne, although less. The dermatologist prescribed me Alysena (BCP) to use with differin xp. Three months later, I had little improvement so she also prescribed a topical antibiotic (aczone gel) which she told me to apply with Differin. *** I still use differin because it has completely removed my blackheads (they used to be HUGE and very noticeable) *** . My skin is also much drier now.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I gained a lot of weight after having my 1st son and a failed IUD. My doc prescribed Adipex 37.5 and I took it 5-6 days per week for 5 months. In the beginning it gave me extreme dry mouth and it was hard to fall asleep because of the energy boost but it suppressed my appetite A LOT and if I ate to much it made me vomit.  I started working out slowly a few times per week and by the time I stopped taking it I was working out 5 days a week. I am 5&#039;8 and my start weight was 195 my end weight was 137.After my 2nd son I lost the weight easily and got back down to 140 but after my daughter I gained and could not lose anything, my energy was low and I could not control my appetite.  As soon. As I am done breastfeeding I will be taking Adipex again""",3
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""Pros: Don&#039;t have to remember to take this and it doesn&#039;t make me feel like crap.
Cons: I AM UNCONTROLLABLE! The anxiety is terrible and I&#039;m CONSTANTLY angry, always unintentionally and it sucks. It&#039;s ruining me.

I was really sick for the better part of the year, so when I went in to find a fix, this is one of the things I was offered. I read the negative reviews and chose to ignore them and I was happy I did. I have just about NO cramping every month and I don&#039;t spend two days in bed feeling awful. I want to stick with this, but I don&#039;t want it to kill me and I&#039;ve been so hostile over such stupid little things and I&#039;m starting to wonder if this is worth the trouble.""",8
Spironolactone,Acne,"""GIVE THIS MEDICATION TIME TO WORK. I have been suffering with acne since I was 12 years old, and I am 39 now. I started spironolactone 8 weeks ago. I would say that the bumpiness in my skin improved within the first week. But the breakout during the 2nd week and the residual mess during week 3 had me wearing turtlenecks. But after that, I saw nothing but improvement. Less and less acne, skin smoothing out, less oiliness. Now I am about 95% clear and I only expect it to get even better!""",4
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I went to my doctor in april of 2000, my weight was 218 lbs and I am only 5 ft 1 inch, so you can imagine me being just as round as tall. I took the pills 3 x a day and walked 1 to 2 miles twice a day. I was down to 135 lbs by the following summer of 2001. I did put on some weight starting in 2003 to 2004 as I had got married and my whole cooking habits changed. I am walking on my treadmill daily now and eating better. Trying to take it off again.""",2
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been fairly recently diagnosed formally with Bipolar II (among a plethora of other things, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as Tourette&#039;s syndrome). I&#039;ve previously been on antipsychotic medication, which I cannot emphasize enough on how negative my experience with this class of medicines has been. Abilify made my anxiety worse. Seroquel made me gain 20 pounds in 2 weeks. Geodon was cost prohibitive and amplified my anxiety. The only side effect I have complaints about is fairly severe dry mouth. I&#039;d recommend a mouthwash that is for people with dry mouth if you opt to take this medicine. Otherwise, I have noticed nearly instant improvement in my symptoms with this.""",6
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""So, I started Belviq a few weeks ago. I sometimes had headaches but nothing a few advil wouldn&#039;t cure. It took about 2 weeks for the medicine to start working. You have to be patient and remember this is a serotonin drug, it affects the serotonin in your brain which controls hunger and feeling of fullness. Its just like when you take medicine for depression, anxiety, OCD, they take time to work.
  I was very surprised I did not have any side effects to speak of because I am super sensitive to medication. I am less hungry and I do not find myself thinking of food all the time. I have lost 4 pounds thus far and am hoping to continue losing weight.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking phentermine 03/29 at 241.6lbs. I was 265lbs in 2010 and lost weight naturally and went to the gym and got down to 211lbs and got lazy and the weight has crept back up. I didn&#039;t think the Rx would work but today 03/30 I was 237.6 after just 1 day. I worked out for 2hrs on my 1st day and had to leave because I was so nauseous. I got a headache and nausea on day 1 and could barely eat. Today was day 2 and my head has been hurting and I&#039;ve been nauseous for over 10hrs and couldn&#039;t go to workout. I am taking 37.5mg I&#039;m the mornings. I read the headache may be hunger or dehydration so I forced down an Apple and naked chicken breast but it was hard to get down and symptoms didn&#039;t go away. I&#039;m gonna try to stick with it.""",3
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I have been on topiramate for about 10 months now and have lost almost 60 lbs. I have had no real side affects except a very dry mouth if i don&#039;t drink enough during the day while I am am at work. My family Doctor has been monitoring my weight loss since day one. I also changed my cooking and eating habits and stopped drinking soft drinks and no longer crave sweets unless it is that time of the month. I have been overweight most of my life and I have tried for years to loose the weight by exercising and weight watchers but it wouldn&#039;t come off and stay off, and now it is!""",2
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I am a mom to two sweet, high energy toddlers that challenge me every minute of the day. I did start feeling on the edge and extremely stressed with my older son. Now I have been on Lexapro for almost two months and so far I like it- feel more patient and calmer, but not a Zombie. I was very scared to gain more weight on top of my remaining pregnancy weight, but actually I started losing weight since my appetite decreased. I hope it continues. I am on 10mg. The side effect- super low libido and possibly feeling a bit more tired. If that&#039;s all I am going to experience, I will stick to it for for another 5-6 months. Overall it is way better than Celexa or Zoloft for me. Good luck!""",7

I have been well under 1200 calories with lots of lemon water, 2L daily. I am always on the go, walking due to my job. I realize it is only day 3, should I have seen some loss?""",3
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve got severe anxiety and panic attacks. I&#039;ve been using lorazepam/avitan for a couple years now to help stop my panic attacks. I can always count on it to work. Last night my anxiety was through the roof. My mind wouldn&#039;t stop racing, my chest hurt, and it felt like I was being stabbed in the gut repeatedly. I want to cry but I knew if I did I would for sure have an attack and wasn&#039;t sure if I could cope right since I was home alone. I keep a vial of my prescription on my keys and took one tablet. In about half an hour I no longer felt like I was dying and was able to get some rest a little after that.

Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Took first pill yesterday. Noticed almost immediately no appetite. Got a hummus wrap for lunch &amp; couldn&#039;t even eat half of it; I can usually eat the whole thing. Dinner I ate the other half then took 2nd pill. Now as I write this almost 14 hours later after that 2nd pill I wish I had never taken it &amp; won&#039;t take it again. Last night chills. My arm tingled all night long &amp; thought it was signaling a heart attack. That thought caused me a lot of anxiety &amp; I could not sleep well. Got up twice during the night to go to the bathroom &amp; had to hold the wall all the way there as my legs and back were in severe muscle pain. This morning had a hard time dragging myself out of bed.  Most meds seem to react fully on me.  I cannot take Belviq.""",3
Adapalene,Acne,"""It works magic!!
The first two weeks, I had outbreaks and my skin was terribly dry. I even considered quitting it. However, my friend is a doctor and he advised me to stick to it. It&#039;s one month now and at the moment I don&#039;t have any more new pimples. My skin has never been so clear before. Depending your condition, I use it together with Clindamycine lotion 1% FNA, an antibiotic topical liquid, during the day to clear up any localized bacteria. I&#039;m so happy now and but I hope I can stop using it after a few months. Anyone with post treatment experience to share is appreciated.""",4
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I have been on Ativan since January 2011, started out with 0.5mg then went to 1mg and have felt better. I used them not only for my anxiety but also to sleep because I have a hard time sleeping at night. I now feel that I can stop taking the medicines for the anxiety, have not had an attack for months but take the medicines to sleep at night. I tried to stop taking Ativan and the withdrawals were so bad I had to start taking them again and now going to see my doctor to help me come off them. """,7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""1st 2 days were great. Took it on an empty belly, felt that euphoric feeling that people mention. Did have trouble sleeping that night. Woke up every 1 to 2 hours. Skip to day 3 I was so exhausted about 2 hours after taking the Phentermine. Doctor suggested to wait longer to eat after taking them. That did the trick. By this time I was taking Unisom or Zzzquil to help sleep at night. That works wonders. Now I&#039;m 3 weeks in and have lost 4 pounds. I would have liked to seen amazing results like everybody else but I&#039;ll take the 4 lbs. Also I&#039;m only on 15 mg. I started at 203 and am at 199. I go in for my 1 month checkup and we&#039;ll see what he thinks of the progress.""",3
Lorazepam,Insomnia,"""Took this with zoloft to get me out of a black hole of anxiety and insomnia after a terrible few weeks trying remeron.  Withdrawals from remeron were terrible and I didn&#039;t sleep for about 6 days  (I&#039;m not exagerating).  Was about to give up but my dad convinced me to try another med since I had an obvious chemical imbalance that wasn&#039;t correcting itself.  Despite not wanting to rely on a benzo for sleep I really didn&#039;t have any alternatives and I needed help fast.  Zoloft combined with this for a few months got me out of the hole I was in.  Tolerance did set in eventually (about a year) but I&#039;m working on finding something safer but this med essentially saved my life.""",0
Remeron,Depression,"""Only been on this for 3 days but don&#039;t think I can take this medicine anymore. Important note this was added to 50mg Zoloft. I have really bad depression and anxiety and fatigue in the mornings. First night I took Remeron hadn&#039;t slept in 20 hours, hadn&#039;t eaten for 8 hours, thought it would help me sleep. Wrong, couldn&#039;t lie still and massive erection for 2 hours, finally got up after 4 hrs tossing and turning ate something then was able to sleep.  2nd night I took with dinner had tacos I ate like 7 tacos, couldn&#039;t stop. Went to sleep 45 mins later even though I was not tired at all, woke up 12 hours later. Incredibly hard to get out of bed felt like I was hit by a train all day.""",5
Niacin,Depression,"""I&#039;m diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 
Before the diagnosis I had a sudden change in my mood form a very happy person to a very depressed person 
After the diagnosis and failure of 3 kind of treatment for My MS because it escalated my depression I stopped everything 
And started the following 
1. Dr.  TerryWahls protocol
2. Vitam B3 3000mg/day

It&#039;s been 2 years and i haven&#039;t got a single relapse 
And the Vitamin b3 helps with the depression.""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""Well, today makes day 2 of taking Contrave. I am on Spring Break and want to monitor my side effects. Day 1 I was still hungry and with cravings. Day 2 took around 10 a.m made eggs with cheese, salmon croquette with a biscuit. I was only able to eat 1/3 of the egg..no biscuit, and took me 30 minutes to each a small portion of the salmon. So, I will come with an  update in a week. I weigh in as 5&#039;4&quot; 251 lbs with no clothes. So, in a week. I will update you all. No activity currently involve.""",2
Celexa,Depression,"""I would say I have seen a complete turn around in my depression. I use 40mg of Celexa and Xanax proscribed three times a day if needed. I usually take two Xanax before bed to fall asleep. I&#039;ve been on it a year and can say its been a a blessing. Didn&#039;t start that way! I chose to stick through some of the side effects and gradually increased my dosage. From 10, 20, 30 now 40 mg which I take every morning. Now I feel the balance. When in need, I spoke with my Doctor to increase if I was not feeling to my full potential of the medicines. Still working on my anxiety around people! Doing better from where I started. GOOD LUCK ALL!""",5
Amnesteem,Acne,"""I am on my 18th day and have noticed DRAMATIC results. I have gotten many compliments. My skin is very dry though and I do have very chapped lips but the redness of my skin has gone away and I barely breakout anymore. My acne was pretty severe. I had tried everything (antibiotics, creams, gels, chemical peels, facials, etc.) I was very nervous about getting on this but I love it and recommend it to everyone.""",4
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I was at work one night and my gallbladder ruptured on me. That was the worst pain I have ever experienced! The pain was so bad that I was drifting in and out of consciousness. Was airlifted to a trauma center and had emergency surgery. They couldn&#039;t do it the laparoscopic way because they had to do the surgery in a rush to hurry and get it out. Was given Dilaudid through IV every 4 hours after surgery. Was very helpful! Didn&#039;t feel any pain at all because it pretty much knocked me out.""",9
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""4 weeks on Cymbalta at 60mg. I came off because they made me feel ill, and I am used to medication as I have tried a few. I spent 3 years on a high dose of Citalopram and never went through anything like I have done with coming off Cymbalta. My GP decided to slowly taper me off and this is when hell started.  Never on any medication that I have taken have the withdrawals been as bad. I have constant nausea, have been sick, stomach aches and pains, diarrhea, dizziness, leg ache, restless sleep, bad dreams, chills, and now my anxiety is back!  I am crying on/off and having panic attacks. It&#039;s just awful.
""",7
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I really think this is a wonderful drug for depression if you don&#039;t have any severe side effects.  I, unfortunately, am experiencing a lot of jaw, face and eye pain.  I went to 5 doctors about it before my psychologist said it was the anti-depressant.  He gave me Klonopin, which made me moody, depressed and extremely self-conscious (not to mention sleepy).  I&#039;ve also had 3 anxiety attacks since taking the Klonopin.  So, I am weening myself off of both and am going back to the doctor in a week.  """,5
Sertraline,Depression,"""At first I was reluctant to take a pill even though I had been diagnosed with major depression.  My family talked me into taking this medication. I am on my third week of taking Zoloft. The first week my doctor started me on 50mg.  The first few days I felt awful but stuck with the medication. I had not felt much relief in my depression and anxiety on 50mg so my psych doc put me on 100mg after two weeks.  I am on day 4 taking 100mg sertraline and have already started to notice a difference in my mood.  I am less anxious and worry much less at work.  I am also beginning to venture out of the house more than I used to.  The only side effects I&#039;ve had on sertraline are mild headache, diarrhea, and decrease in sexual performance.""",5
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My 7 year old son started Vyvanse about 3 weeks ago.  The first day he took a 30 mg dose which made him like a zombie all day and absolutely manic all night.  He literally stayed up all night and ran up and down the hall and talked incessantly.

At the end of my rope at 7 am I paged his doctor.  We lowered the dose to 15 mg.

He seemed initially to do better on the 15mg and was doing well in school.  He became more aggressive and started having OCD behaviors of constantly washing his hands (I counted 30 times in an hour) and crying and staying up all night.  Last night he stayed up until 4:30 am and I was at my wits end.

So today his doctor is switching him to another medication but we may try it in a combination.""",1
Qsymia,Obesity,"""5&#039;8&quot; 220lb female. Currently on day 9 of the 14 day low dose trial. I have lost 5 lbs. so far. I have been doing a low carb diet since I started Qsymia and find I have 
very little appetite. I&#039;m comfortable with a protein bar or a piece of cheese or meat for my meals. I drink plenty of water as diet drinks taste flat and extra sweet. I too have no desire for what was my favorite indulgence of a glass or two of wine at night. I read somewhere Qsymia is used to treat alchoholism and I can see why. Today was the first day I felt a bit hungry, so I&#039;m thinking of moving to the next higher dose a few days early. My goal is to lose 60 lbs and lower my extremely high cholesterol so I don&#039;t have to go on meds. I also find I have a decent amount of energy.""",2
Remeron,Depression,"""Remeron helped very much initially. After trying a host of other depression meds, this one seemed to work and had minimal side effects after the first week. However, at a low dose it stopped doing the job and have had to go up twice to the max dose of 45 mg. I no longer sleep well, and have had HUGE weight gain and ended up with diabetes. I plan to gradually wean myself off and treat the depression with natural means--exercise, diet, supplements.""",5
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""In my never ending quest for migraine prevention, my doctor decided to try doxepin to try to take out the migraines, the anxiety, and the insomnia all at once, figuring it &quot;couldn&#039;t hurt.&quot; Well. It hurt. No effect on migraines, sleep, or anxiety. None at all. It did, though, drop my blood pressure so low I couldn&#039;t walk for long, needed to lean on walls to stay upright, couldn&#039;t carry a cohesive conversation because I was too foggy to remember what I&#039;d already said - in short, it did no good and left me unable to function at work, safely drive, make it up the steps to my bedroom, etc. Pulse also became erratic. And? I was only on half the child&#039;s starting dose. It was bad enough that I stopped it and then told the doctor.""",0
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Lamictal for hmm... ~5 months now. I feel it has seriously been one of the most helpful things in my life. I feel very present to the moment, mostly calm, and overall.. content. It basically just improves my personality. Some side effects though. Terrible memory. Seriously. My perception of time is all out of whack too. I said I have been taking it for only 5 months but that is so hard to believe! It feels like I&#039;ve on it for at least a year. Oh well. I still like it because lifestyle doesn&#039;t require a sharp memory. If your lifestyle does require sharpness I advise against taking this.""",6
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I was in good health but developed severe neuropathic burning pain all over the body due to an MRI scan. I have been taking 10mg amitriptyline for the past 4 weeks and it seems to be starting to work, the burning pain is less severe so far. It hasn&#039;t helped any other symptoms which devleoped following teh scan but I would recommend it for neuropathic pain- also, I haven&#039;t develeoped any of the stated side effects. My friend also takes it in a higher dose (50) for depression and she is fine on it (no weight gain etc). Side effects not a reason to not take for pain.""",9
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got the Skyla IUD put in in the beginning of May 2014 due to my inability to take combined hormonal birth control of any sort due to major migraines and mood swings. My first two periods after insertion gave me the most terrible cramps, but have since lightened up a lot as has my period flow.  It messed with my sex drive for a while, but that seems to have evened out as well.  The only real downside that I can tell is the 3 or so days of spotting after my period, but that has slowly been disappearing as well.  I would honestly suggest the Skyla to anyone after all my terrible experiences with other birth controls this has been a major God send.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This is my 3rd day on Phentermine 37.5. I take a half pill in the morning before breakfast and then the other half b/w 1&amp;2. I have still experienced hunger around 12 as if I haven&#039;t ate anything at all. But when I do eat something I am full pretty quickly. My starting weight is 270. I am 5&#039;7 and 22 year old female. I will only be on this for 2 months so I&#039;m hoping for good results along with exercise and healthy eating""",3
Seasonique,Birth Control,"""I started taking Seasonique about 6 months ago when my boyfriend recommended I switch birth controls. (I was previously on Apri 28 and it made me crazy) I love Aeasonique! It&#039;s amazing to only have to worry about periods once every three months! One con I did notice is slight cramping around the times I used to get my period, other then this the birth control is amazing. I have clearer skin, lost weight, and have been feeling like myself again. Would recommend this to anyone!""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started taking Contrave Jan 2016.  I lost about 10lbs within 3 months.  I&#039;ve been on/off it several times over the last 1.5 years.  It seems to work in the beginning (1st month) but then your body becomes adjusted to it.  10lbs is not worth the side effects and heart risks.  I&#039;ve heard this crazy stories of folks losing upwards of 35lbs in 3 months.  Definitely didn&#039;t work that well for me.  Save your money and try eating less and exercising more.""",2
Phentermine,Obesity,"""After experiencing extreme weight gain due to a horrible experience with an imbedded IUD, I was advised by a colleague to try adipex 37.5. I have been taking it since June 1, 2015 and started at 238.2 lbs. Today I weigh 227.4 lbs. it has helped me by suppressing my appetite, increasing my energy and giving me motivation by seeing my weight loss occur so quickly. I walk twice per day and lift weights three times per week. (Arms, legs, abs) I had the dry mouth but lots of water and Biotene help. Insomnia is managed by taking pill no later than 1pm. No rapid heart beat &amp; managing salt intake may help BP. I stay below 1500 mls daily. Will update next month. I&#039;m happy.""",2
Contrave,Obesity,"""Been on Contrave for 30 days. I was 283 at 5&#039;7 but now 272. Am disappointed b/c I did a 180 degree change on my diet, exercised daily and only lost 11 pounds in 30 days. I am going in the right direction. I didn&#039;t have the constipation or nausea. I am pretty &quot;foggy&quot; still. But I have thyroid issues and have an appt. for that on the 23rd of February and hoping to get regulated and maybe I&#039;ll have more success at losing weight. I&#039;m not giving up though!""",2
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Saxenda since 5/5/17. 20lbs gone, losing very slowly. I work out hard 5-6 days a week. I slowly increased my dosage because it made me so nauseous. I started dosing at night which helped. If I eat a large or fatty evening meal, I would get sick in the morning. Overall I only threw up about 4 or 5 times. Finally at the 3.0 dosage after 3 months. Now I have no side effects at all. I read that other&#039;s side effects disappeared at 3.0. Wish I didn&#039;t increase so slowly. I had muscle pain in my right side which took a couple of weeks to go away. I have muscle pain in my right neck, it&#039;s getting better but occasionally hurts. My Dr. told me that muscle pains are a side effect. Will see how it continues to help.""",3
Atralin,Acne,"""I started out on Differin, Duac and an oral skin antibiotic, which improved my acne about 90%.  About 2 weeks ago, my dermatologist took me off the oral antibiotic and switched me over to just Atralin.  So far, I am breaking out again but I am hoping it is just the initial adjustment period causing it to do this (getting better before it gets worse).  I will give it another week or two and then I will probably go back in if it doesn&#039;t improve.  The upside is that it does not cause a lot of peeling or irritation, as did the other creams.  I have very sensitive and maturing skin so I thought this would be a great choice for me.""",4
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""My experience with lamictal is different for me in most cases. I used to take 25mg of lamictal. When I had taken the meds everyday I didn&#039;t feel any different from when I wasn&#039;t taking them. I had no side effects it was like taking air. So I kept having suicidal thoughts &amp; being angry at 8am &amp; by 8:30 am i was happy. I just had different moods every 30 mins. So i talked to my doctor and told her the meds werent working i told her how i was feeling so she gave me 100mg. Ever since then i have had no feeling what so ever. Like I can choose what to care about &amp; what not to care about. I&#039;ll be fine all day and by 8-9 o&#039;clock pm all of my bipolar &amp; depression hits me like a wave of sadness that I feel like I&#039;m drowning in. I guess its worth it..""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started Phentermine 37.5 on May 29, 2015 (a month now). I was at 211 (my biggest I&#039;ve ever been). I already eat pretty healthy and exercise everyday for about 2 hours but I was not losing any weight. I had a friend that was on it and lost about 50 pounds so I thought I would give it a go. I got a small headache like one or two times, I still sleep really well. I went from 2011 to currently 196, a total of 15 pounds in one month. I&#039;m hoping to lose about 50 pounds so I could get at a good weight. I bike ride everyday and run but since I&#039;m starting my second month of dosage I am going to work on ab workouts and lifting so I can try to get toned. I&#039;ll make an update soon!""",3
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I started on Qsymia 4/26/2015, at my yearly checkup. I am a 55 yr old female, and am post menopausal, and have hit a road block when it comes to losing weight. My Dr. said I am in wonderful health and was not concerned with my 5&#039;9&#039;&#039; 264lb body. At my request, she told me about Qsymia and suggested that I try it for an added boost , since I do exercise and eat healthy already but was not seeing results like I should be seeing. She prescribed the low 2 week starter dose. I have only been taking for 5 days but already have seen success. 5lbs. lost, with no side affects. Only thing was 1 day when I did not eat enough and I went for my 30 min walk, I about passed out, weak legs, dizzy, and fast heart rate due to not eating. Will make sure to eat.""",2
Liletta,Birth Control,"""I wanted to share because I had the liletta IUD inserted today and I was terrified after reading all these reviews. I almost didn&#039;t go through with it.  However, after a lengthy discussion with my doctor, I did.  And personally, the pain during was nothing. Literally felt like a small pinch.  And so far, I&#039;ve had no cramping.  Yes, I&#039;m bleeding but I&#039;m on my period, per my doctor the best time to put it in.  I can&#039;t believe how worked up I was about the pain, I&#039;m not saying the reviews are false because everyone is different but to anyone reading these who hasn&#039;t had it.  Don&#039;t fully take these to heart. You know your body.  Talk to your doctor. I&#039;m so glad I went through with it.""",8
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on it for 1.2 weeks. started at 20 and now up to 40 mg. I was so scared to try this medicine because unfortunately I have a side effect to just about every anti-psychotic except Seroquel. They tend to make my eyes roll back I can bring them down to look at you but then they stay stuck up. Not even Cogentin helps. I am so excited because this has not happened with the Latuda yet. I am down 6.4 pounds. And I feel great. My appetite is very curb. Unfortunately my first week I had a lot of anxiety. And one very bad day. But all of that has seemed to subside. My stomach has been upset... But I&#039;m willing to take the bad... Because I&#039;m getting so much good""",6
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I LOVE Prozac. I have major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. I was on Lexapro for half a year, and despite not being a teen or young adult I had my first ever suicidal thoughts. On the Lexapro I felt sedated, I gained weight, and I was still depressed. It did help with anxiety, but instead I was often nauseated. 
Now after 2 weeks of Prozac, world of difference. I&#039;m smiling, motivated, looking forward to the near and distant future. I still have some mild nausea, and it&#039;s not as good with the anxiety or insomnia. Still, it&#039;s great for me because I&#039;m motivated and energetic enough throughout the day to make myself tired enough to sleep, and I&#039;m better at dealing with stressful things.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Ive been on Phentermine for one month now, and already I&#039;ve lost 10 lbs, but I still eat, just not as much as I used to. when I started I weighed 130, I know I know, &quot;your not fat&quot; but even the thin people have problem areas, and thats what I want to get rid of. Im always on my feet I work 3 jobs. In the month that I have taken them, not once have I not been able to fall asleep, I have felt pretty moody though.If I dont take it I wake up with a pounding head ech.""",3
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I started belviq Monday May 2nd. I have yet to feel an results. If anything I feel like eating everything I see.. I&#039;m wanting to eat more than I did before starting it. I have read some reviews showing that the medicine took a few weeks to start working. I hope this is my case. I do feel very sleeping after I take it. It is harder for me to get up in the mornings. I feel like I am in such a deep sleep since I have started. I haven&#039;t had any headaches but have noticed dry mouth.""",2
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""After 20 years of seeing psychiatrists, I was finally correctly diagnosed with ADD. My life completely normalized soon after starting this drug. I took every antidepressant known to man with no results. If you change jobs, friends, wives, more often than your motor oil, ADD may be your issue too. I have suffered with this for 49 years now I feel like what I assumed normal people feel like. I thank my lucky stars every day for this wonder drug. Only reason I rated a 9  was because of the dry mouth it gives me, but a small price to pay for the benefits received.""",1
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I had been on depo for 10 years. I switched to nexplanon about 9-10 month ago. I wanted off depo because I had no sex drive, thinning hair, and bad bad acne. Since switching my hair is getting thicker, my sex drive has gone through the roof, and my acne has settled down. I am getting a full 3-5 day period every three weeks.... I&#039;m waiting to see if this goes away. I haven&#039;t gained weight, my breast have grown-and are very sensitive and tender. Right now the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s are equal. If I continue to get a period so often I may consider changing, but I am happy with how it makes me feel compared to the drone I was on the depo.""",8
Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been talking zyprexa for about for about 2 weeks now. Family says they can tell a big difference. Mornings are a little hard to get motivated, but I also take Ritalin for add. So that helps me get going. Falling asleep easily and staying asleep. No more racing thoughts or depression. My anxiety is more under control. It does give me craving for food, but I have controlled it so far. I take 5 mg daily.so far so good.""",6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""Everyone reacts differently to medication. Dosage: 10mg, Sex: Male, Age: 58, Diagnosis: Chronic Insomnia. I&#039;ve take Belsomra 3 nights now with 1 to 2 hours of sleep each night. This is strange stuff, be careful. You feel tired but it does not shut your mind off, I laid in bed for 4 hours awake. At that point after 2 nights of not sleeping I think I would have fallen asleep any way from exhaustion. I did not think I was asleep but started to experiencing the strangest nightmares I have ever had. After another hour of this I did fall into a dream state sleep for sure. The dreams were extremely unusual and lucid ( like when taking Restoril) very strange. I fell in and out of sleep for about 2 hours then woke at 4 am and that was   it.""",0
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lithium is a lifesaver. I had been misdiagnosed for years. When I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 was happy to finally find somewhere to start.
 People scared me off lithium with all of the side effects. I was afraid of weight gain etc don&#039;t be! All of our side effects are different. I wish I would have tried it way sooner. I&#039;m a ton happier! I haven&#039;t been this happy in years. I&#039;m a completely different person. Sure, I have to deal with stomach aches if I don&#039;t eat with it. The thirst goes down but still need to drink water - that&#039;s very important. And tests are not that big of deal.""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have a 7 year old son with ADHD. He was diagnosed at 4 years old. Through the years he has been on 3 different medications. Ritalin was first and it did help with his hyperactivity level, however he still had problems with impulsiveness. Then he was on Focalin XR and that did nothing with his impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Now he is on Vyvanse and that has helped with ADHD symptoms. The only problem that I am currently having is that he has days where he is extremely emotional. He has days where he is getting upset over minor details like coming home after playing at a friends house. I am not sure if this is drug related or ADHD related. Impulsive people have problems containing their emotions.""",1
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I have been using this drug (known in Australia as Restavit).

Several times she apparently awoke only to begin babbling back in her dream state. 
She was constantly getting up and walking around, turning on lights. 
She was crying uncontrollably at times for half an hour at a time. 
This morning she has no recollection of any of it. I will keep using it. She will not.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I was prescribed Adipex by my doctor 9/18/17 and so far so good. I do not own a scale so I am waiting on my monthly doctor visit so that he may monitor my weight loss. The first day I felt like I could run a Marathon and I did not at a thing that day, but drank a lot of water. The next couple days to a week it evened out a little better not as hyper, but enough energy to function. I am taking the 37.5 I take a a half of a pill in the morning and a half in the afternoon as prescribed by my doctor. Your doc may prescribe differently, but this does make the effects of the drug easier to handle. I started off at 250lbs ( I hate to admit) and being only 5&#039;3 I feel terrible about my weight. I want to be at 130 when finished""",3
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Vyvanse is great.  It has a longer dosing window than Adderall XR (12 vs 8 hours for me) and a slightly improved side-effect profile.  As a longtime (~16 years) prescription stimulant user, for ADHD, I would recommend Vyvanse to any user that is currently unsatisfied with their ADHD management.  It is no silver bullet, but there are no silver bullets for ADHD.  It is incremental innovation in a great way. Vyvanse is the first real stimulant to reduce side effects without cutting efficacy.""",1
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""I have ADHD and Bulimia. I read through everyone&#039;s comments and I couldn&#039;t agree more. I am a 21 year old model living in New York City and suffered from chronic ADHD/ADD and Bulimia. Ritalin would make me so jittery I couldn&#039;t even try to do anything. 1 hour of euphoria that led no WHERE. (Focalin *is new* did the same thing just paid more!) So they tried everything in every batch: Daytrana, Focalin and Ritalin.. then Vyvanse with Adderall IR or AddXR with ADD IR

Anyways I looked up online and saw how Dexedrine is what makes up half of Adderall. I asked my doctor he was like &quot;ehh&quot; but he went for it. I&#039;ve been on it ever since. I think it is the most under credited ADHD/Stimulant medicine on the market. I have no anxiety, clean concentration! """,1
Nefazodone,Anxiety,"""I have been using Serzone and the generic versions for over 15 years now.  When the brand was pulled from the market, I tried Wellbutron, Celexa and Prozac.  All three had horrible side effects and I finally found a doctor who would prescribe me the generic of Serzone again.  This medication keeps me on an even keel, keeps the anxious thoughts from overwhelming me and helps me sleep at night.  My liver panels are always perfect and my only side effect is that I have to take it right before I go to bed as it makes me sleepy.""",7
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was recently taken off of lithium for bipolar because of my thyroid problems. I am very happy with Latuda. It works quickly and makes me feel normal for the most part. I have only had a little irritability, but it quickly subsided.  The main problem I have had with Latuda is drowsiness. I take it at night, but am still having a difficult time waking up. I&#039;m going to try taking it earlier, like right after dinner, and see if that helps me wake up earlier. I have to wake up by 6:00 a.m. once school starts again since I am a teacher.  I have been waking up around 10:00 a.m., and don&#039;t think that will work. I recommend trying Latuda!""",6
Bupropion,Depression,"""When I first began this medication, it increased my suicidal thoughts but that was expected. After about 2 weeks, I began to feel better. I was more cheerful. After a month of taking the medication, I was completely happy. There are days when it does not work but that is expected. Recently, my dosage was raised from 75mg twice a day to 150 twice a day. My body is still trying to adapt to the recent increase. I am more sensitive to touch. Almost everything tickles. I don&#039;t mind it. This is a good medication. I&#039;m a little sad that I have to get off of it in July.""",5
Seroquel,Insomnia,"""I am 49 yr old female with a lifetime of insomnia.  I had been taking Ambien for sleep for over a decade for my insomnia, but had been waking up during the night, cooking, cleaning, drawing, etc., so my doctor suggested I try 50 mg Seroquel instead.  I&#039;ve been taking it two weeks now, and I am sleeping and waking alert (YES!) and not semi foggy...you all know that feeling right?  Added benefit is I am less anxious through out the day.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Started diet on 4/12 (236.8 lbs) using my fitness pal app 1200 calorie diet. Lost 8.3 in 7 days. Began Pentermine on 4/21 (228.8lbs) today is 5/5 and I&#039;m down 14lbs from Phentermine 22.5 lbs total since 4/12. Goal weight is 175lbs. Last seven days I lost 4.4lbs so the weight loss slows down after the first weeks.  I&#039;ve been running 3 miles every other day and workout 3-4x a week. Drink plenty of water. Goal weight 175lbs. I&#039;m on a 600 cal a day diet and I rarely go beyond 450 calories. No side effects, I take weekly pics, huge difference even over the last 7 days, I look 10 years younger already. I&#039;m 45.""",3
Strattera,ADHD,"""19 yrs Male 175 lb

I was diagnosed with ADHD in March, being an engineering major made my psychiatrist skeptical if I actually had ADHD (I do), so he prescribed me Strattera. He told me it was completely safe and had no side effects. I took it daily, for a month straight, and I felt nothing. I 
told my psychiatrist this and he increased my dosage to 40 mg.

I continued taking my dosage daily and did not notice anything on the first week of my 40 mg dosage. However, I did start developing irrational thoughts. For example, I began thinking everyone hated me, soon after, I started becoming suicidal. I tried killing myself by overdosing on opiates, but my roommate called the ambulance. I stopped taking it, and I started feeling normal again.""",1
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien for 12 yrs now.  I took my 1st Belsomra 3 hours ago and am still wide awake and the only thing I have felt is extreme nausea.  I never get nauseated from medications.  In fairness to Belsomra, me taking Ambien for so long may have made me too tolerant.  I will tell you that my doctor also gave me Zanaflex, which I took last night.  After 2 days of NO sleep, I fell asleep within 10 minutes.  Once it hits you, you kind of lose control of your ability to walk or speak without sounding drunk.  My husband had to carry me to bed.  It&#039;s apparently a very potent muscle relaxer.  It works.  However, I woke up 3 hrs later.  That&#039;s typical for me on any sleep meds though.  Ask about Zanaflex if none of the others work.""",0
Kapvay,ADHD,"""We have a 8 year old who we adopted from foster care last year.  He was diagnosed with ADHD soon after.  He was put on Concerta.  We saw definite improvement.  But early this year, he started exhibiting increased symptoms of ADHD.  He could not fall asleep until late so we used Melatonin.  His doctor started him on Kapvay about 5 weeks ago.  We started seeing a great improvement the first week because he fell asleep without Melatonin and started getting 10 hours of sleep.  The second week we added the morning dose.  Mornings immediately became incredible.  We no longer needed check lists for him.  The teacher said he still needed better focus so he is now on .3mg.  He is doing incredibly well.  His doctor is going to ween him down on Concerta.""",1
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""After being disgusted with my constant weight gain, I decided to try the Real Adipex-P and not  the generic version of it. The generic  gave me really bad mood swings and made my heart flutter a lot but the Real brand has worked totally different feeling. I began on June 9th at my all time high weight of 345.4. I have found that once I chose to eat clean and refrain from beef,pork, sodas, and anything white; I got a better outcome. I have to say that we are all different and any weight loss is a plus.  I am not boasting but I am happy to report that I weighed in today and I weighed 313.6!! That&#039;s a little over 30 pounds in 5 days shy of a month.  Ya&#039;ll,  we can do this. We must not give up and stop trying! I am striving for 150 pounds.""",3
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started lithium nearly 2 years ago,  thyroid went almost instantly along with energy and about 10% of my hair.  Then followed by liver (they keep saying liver isn&#039;t affected but I never had a problem with my liver and had blood tests done 3 months before my lithium start). I have a huge personal event happen that shattered those around me but I am completely numb.  When you can&#039;t feel then you have to ask is it worth it.""",6
Voltaren Gel,Pain,"""I used this stuff on my sprained ankle after my uncle told me that his doctor recommended it for pain and inflammation. I gave it a go and I found after about 10-15 minutes the pain I had been experiencing was virtually gone. I also found that it helped heal the bruising on my ankle as well. I have fibromyalgia as well and never thought to use it on my joints, I&#039;ll for sure give it a go! The only downside to this product is it smells really bad.""",9
Liletta,Birth Control,"""After spending a lot of time reading reviews and doing research before getting my IUD, I wanted to share my insertion experience. Personally, I would rate the overall pain as maybe a 2/10. For those ladies who get bad cramps during menstruation, the cramping I experienced was maybe half as bad as some of my worst cramps. Overall, I would say the experience causes more discomfort than pain. I was not on my period during insertion (mid cycle actually). It&#039;s been about 10 hours since the insertion and I still have mild cramping. I took ibuprofen prior to my appointment and haven&#039;t taken more. My experience was no where near as bad as I was expecting based on other reviews. As many have pointed out, everybody&#039;s body is different.""",8
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on 11 meds in 5 years.  MDD re diagnosed as Biplar1 three years ago.  Seroquel works for me.  Started on 25 mg q.d. But after psychotic break out am up to 400mg.  Plus 900mg Lithium.  I think we&rsquo;re getting close to right cocktail including Adderall and atavin when required.  No weight gain but have had eating binges.  Makes me sleepy but I&rsquo;m ok by 10:00 am with sheer guts and. Coffee.  I am thankful for these medicines.""",6
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""My son suffer from biopolar and really loves his manic episode. It was a constant fight to get him to take his Medication. I was at lost with his violent episodes, No sleeping and all that comes with this condition. When the doctor recommended injection I admit I was scared I saw some bad reviews but 
I felt there was no other solution after 3 days he started coming down. It&#039;s now been 1 month and all I can say is thank god for this  medication. And thank god it comes in injection. The only side effect at the moment is that he is tired. But next month he will get 300 and then 200.I taught I lost my son for good but this saved my son and our family. Nothing but good review till now. My son is 18 yrs old.""",6
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I have carried around an additional 35 lbs on this 5&#039;3&quot; body for six years with no willpower or cravings control to get it off.  Just finished my first full week on Belviq and have lost 3.5 lbs.  I lose like a snail so this is impressive. I did have a mild headache for the first three evenings which went away with Advil.  Mild dry mouth and definitely felt a bit off balance but the good news is that my urgent hunger pangs and carb, dessert and wine cravings are gone!  Still enjoy my food but, as others have said, I am perfectly happy to make healthy choices and to eat small portions.  I have been able to cut down on my evening wine and have substituted my evening ice cream with herb tea.  All of these changes have been painless.""",2
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""After being on 80 mg of OxyContin 3 times a day I wasn&#039;t getting the pain relief. I went thru breakthroughs and my insurance would only cover generic oxy. Saw a new pain doc and the nurse practitioner switched me to Opana, only 30 mg twice a day. My breakthrough meds stay locked up unless I&#039;m doing something special. I always take Opana with food (instructions say take on an empty stomach) as I found taking taking it with food makes it last longer. Due to insurance I had to switch tot 15 mg, 2 tabs, twice a day. I found this give me some flexibility. If I&#039;m having a tough day I may take one around 5 pm and then only one at bedtime. Medicare sucks though. I hit the gap about 6 months ago and found out I have to pay 4,800+ til it&#039;s done.""",9
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I&#039;m 19 and suffer from bad insomnia. I&#039;ve tried Benadryl, Unisom, even a different prescription sleeping pill, Restoril (temazepam). These all either didn&#039;t work or left me extremely groggy in the morning and throughout the day. Anyway, I was scheduled to study abroad and my worst fear the entire trip was not sleeping in a foreign atmosphere. My Dr. prescribed me a few weeks worth of Ambien 10 MG. I can&#039;t tell you how great this medication was. It drifted me off to a gentle, deep sleep and I stayed asleep for at least 7 hours. I woke up happy and refreshed In the morning; even energized! I took the high dose and did not experience any side effects or hallucinations. I was able to enjoy my trip.""",0
Focalin,ADHD,"""My 4 yo started taking focalin today..5mg.. she is higher than a kite.. she talks incessantly.. she is licking her chin.. she is having mouth ticks..she is sweating and scratching her face and arms..her heart is beating so fast and is crying too. She will NEVER take this med again.. ADHD is easier than this. It has been nearly 6 hrs and it is still going strong. I can&#039;t get anything done for fear of taking my eyes off her. I would give it a 0 but wasn&#039;t an option.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started February 3rd of 2016, so I have been taking this medication for 5 weeks.  I am 21, 5&#039;2 and started at 259 lbs.   It has been five weeks, but I didn&#039;t take the medicine consistently or eat right during the third week due to a passing in the family.  I also haven&#039;t exercised at all due to the passing of my grandpa and I started my school semester when I first got the prescription. I do plan on adding exercise into my routine, but just by eating less and trying to eat better I have lost 26 lbs in a month and a half! I&#039;m at 233. I have went from a size 18 pants being TIGHT to a size 14 pants fitting perfectly. There is a noticeable difference and only side effects are headaches and dizziness, but after water and Tylenol I&#039;m fine! :)""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""I have been dealing with severe anxiety and depression for 16 years and it keeps getting worse and worse. I have no drive or ambition, lost my girl friend and job came to an end. It finally made me realize that I have to do something about this problem. I have been totally against medicines and have always disregarded mental illness but I now think it is mental illness that has put me in this terrible place. I have started taking Celexa 10 (20mg) days ago and am so excited to see the results. I have not noticed much response yet but I am generally less negative and have more excitement for things that I once loved.""",5
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking this for 2 weeks now. I had previously taken 60mg Fluoxetine for 2 months from which I was suffering horrible side effects, strange as I&#039;d had a successful 6 month run on it several years ago. Having weaned myself off that and onto Mirtazapine I can&#039;t begin to describe the difference I&#039;m feeling. Before I felt worthless and suicidal, had no appetite, couldn&#039;t sleep, and when I did I suffered from night terrors, and also had a complete lack of energy. Now I&#039;m on Mirtazapine I can sleep again, I&#039;m eating which in turn is giving me more energy, and I actually feel like myself! Plus my sex drive was non-existent and it&#039;s now returned to normal. So far, this is my wonder drug. Big thumbs up!""",5
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am a 42 yr. old woman with ADHD along with Bipolar Depression also coming off 8 yrs. of taking pain medications every day ( norco&#039;s as well as Percocet&#039;s) I was getting between both 300 a month.. I&#039;ve been off the pain meds for 4 mth now so far so good.. But after the fog cleared from the pain meds all my other diagnoses come out full blast,. So I was taking a 2mg Xanax, 350mg soma, along with 300mg trazadone at night and still couldn&#039;t sleep. Thanks to my new doctor I&#039;m on 1mg Xanax along with 100mg Seroquel at night and within a hour I&#039;m asleep and I mean good sleep (no dreams getting up thru the night etc.,) so fingers crossed it stays that&#039;s way!!!""",6
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""Systemic Lupus for 3 years, severe spinal issues and now a trapped nerve in my buttocks. After no sleep for 5 days I became suicidal. Doc prescribed 10 mg&#039;s of Elavil...but it didn&#039;t work UNTIL I increased the dose to 30 mg&#039;s.  NOW I am finally getting sleep and pain relief.  This medicine is more effective than Oxycontin, hydromorphone and many other medicines I have taken for pain (ibuprofen, and other OTC medicines.) For me, the key was to increase the dose.  Yes, there are side effects - constipation, dry mouth, drowsiness - but this is mild compared to suffering in so much pain that I did not want to live anymore.""",9
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""I have been getting the shot for a little over a year now. At first I loved it. I never got a period, no mood swings, a little weight loss, it was amazing. The only thing I am considering switching for is that I got really bad acne. I asked the nurse that gives me the shot if that was from the shot and she said no it does not cause acne, but I never had acne like this before. Other then that it was great.""",8
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""So far I&#039;m happy with the Lexapro I had the yawning, drowsy in the afternoons one night consisted of the jitters but half a 5mg valium had me soon settled, and so far only needed it the once. I still don&#039;t have much of an appetite at the moment so that&#039;s the worst of it all so far fingers crossed it stays that way. I have noticed my anxiety getting better slowly it&#039;s only been 1 week on 5mg I don&#039;t want to get my hopes up but I guess that&#039;s my anxiety way of thinking kicking in.""",7
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""Having been recently diagnosed with ADD at the age of 31, I would have to say that stimulant therapy has been a God send! My doctor first prescribed Ritalin-SR, and I felt it was not as effective as it could be, so she changed my prescription to Adderall-XR 20 mg and I feel it is working. 

I feel more focused at work with better concentration. I don&#039;t procrastinate as often as I have (my entire life), but one unexpected result of the therapy is I no longer feel irritable and short-tempered! I also don&#039;t feel frustrated as much as I used too. My staff and co-workers have noticed the difference and have told me they don&#039;t feel the need to &quot;walk on egg-shells&quot; around me! 

So in summation, Adderall is certainly doing the trick!""",1
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I took Risperdal (Resperidone) for about five years. It effectively managed my maina/hypomania and gave me no obvious side effects towards the beginning.

Pros
-Effectively worked
-Helped with hypomania
-Helped with mania

Cons
-Developed Hyperprolactinemia
-From ^^^ i developed amenorrhea and weight gain
-Mental Slowness (things were harder to learn and harder to remember)

It&#039;s a good medication that worked for me, but I had unfortunate side effects. Everyone is different so don&#039;t automatically discount the drug if you are just starting it based on everyone else&#039;s experience. It DID work for me the way it was supposed to, but I also had side effects so I had to switch it. I&#039;m giving it 8 out of 10 because it DID manage my BPD well.""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Had my Mirena inserted July 30 2014, I am giving it such a high rating at this point because I have nothing but positive experiences so far. 
Unlike most people I had it inserted after having no children, the insertion was slightly painful but just felt like a bad cramp that went away quickly. The cramping stopped 2 minutes after insertion and then I had some mild cramping later that day. Spotting is minimal to null, only noticeable on bathroom tissue. 
-For anyone thinking of getting on before they have had a kid: I was given misoprostol vaginally to soften the cervix and took ibuprofen for 24 hours before to help with cramping.  The misoprostol did not cause me cramping or discomfort as I feared it would.""",8
Duloxetine,Pain,"""After the removal of a tumour and bone graft surgery I suffered from debilitating pain that occurred at night which ultimately kept me from sleeping.  For years, me and the doctors searched for the source of the pain but they could not find a reason and I was told to live with it.  This year I was suggested Cymbalta because my doctor had said it was working as a pain reliever for other patients.  I was willing to try anything to rid the pain and After about 3 weeks I noticed a dramatic decrease in my pain.  After a few months I am practically pain free. For those who deal with chronic pain on a daily basis this is best thing that could happen.  I never thought anything would help, Cymbalta has given me my life back.""",9

Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I have debilitating anxiety which keeps me from leaving the house many days. Before, I would cry almost daily, even when life was going better. The little things tore me apart. With the buspar... it&#039;s like I&#039;m getting &quot;moments&quot; back. I still get anxious sometimes, but I have occasional periods of feeling. ... normal. Clear. Simple, natural interactions with family and friends are possible again. As time goes on, I&#039;m experiencing more and more &quot;moments&quot; of real life again, or, life before anxiety. Multiple friends have told me I seem much happier. Though I don&#039;t particularly think of myself as suddenly &quot; all sunshine and roses&quot;,  I feel like I have my life back. I&#039;m actually living again.""",7
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""I find that with Adderall XR everything has improved. I am diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, Bipolar mixed cycling, and anxiety {GAD}. Before I would stay in bed for three weeks straight because I had no energy. With Adderall XR I am able to function. Recently I have lost my pill bottle (a real downside to being adhd - you loose things), and I am not looking forward to sitting through more classes without it. I think I&#039;ve finally found the right dose - 30 MG once a day in the morning seems to work for me. I just cannot have any type of eggs. I notice, however, that this makes me feel a million times better. I&#039;ve noticed a little weight loss but not much.""",1
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had the implanon now for 2 years in the beginning everything was good, the last year I have been suffering from horrible aniexty attacks not sure if its because of the birth control or not, I have been breaking out like crazy!

Hopefully soon I&#039;ll get it out and I will be back to myself !""",8
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I have been on Neurontin for 3 months now for anxiety. I started at 100 mg 3x a day and now at 600 mg 3x a day and very happy with that dose. I very rarely have to take my Vistaril. Before taking this my anxiety got so severe that I actually feared planes crashing on top of me every time I heard one go by. I only experienced mild sedation when I started it and it is gone now. No other side effects. It may not work for everyone, but I would definitely recommend giving it a try to anyone who&#039;s doctor recommends it!""",7
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on Belviq for five months now.  I&#039;m down 30 pounds and I still have about 30 to go.  I&#039;m very pleased with my results.  I use a meal tracker app and stay between 1000-1200 calories a day which can be difficult.  I&#039;m going to increase to 1300-1400 the next couple of months (which may slow my weight loss down a bit but I&#039;m okay with that) because it&#039;s comfort food season! I still love to eat and I think I&#039;ve been successful because I can still have delicious food but with the medicine I&#039;m satisfied with very small portions.""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started Adipex-p on May 10 weighing 292 pounds. It&#039;s now May 19 and so far I&#039;ve lost 9 pounds!

Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I always fall asleep reasonably quickly but wake briefly at the end of each sleep cycle (which get shorter as the night progresses) until about 2am when I remain awake for about 2 to 3 hours. With Belsomra I still wake at the end of each cycle but quickly fall asleep again throughout the whole night.
It took some trial and error to get the right dose. A 20mg tablet worked but left me sleepy the next day. 10mg (half a tablet) works well for a whole night without next day sleepiness and 5mg was ineffective.""",0
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m in my late 20&#039;s and tried it for ADHD...all I can say is that it really messed up my sleep. It also severely worsened my depression. It has a long half life. Benefits I did notice is that it seemed that my memory improved somewhat, for example could remember several songs playing in a row, also focus seemed improved. I&#039;m considering adding trazodone in hopes of aboring its negative effect on sleep.  For anyone complaining about blood pressure side effects, lower your dose.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This product was awesome. I went from 192 lbs in September of 2005 to 138lbs in January of 2006 without any form of exercise.  I was working 2 jobs and it gave me more energy than anything else I&#039;ve ever tried. Some days I would have to force myself to eat something because I just wasn&#039;t hungry.

Then, they took the stuff of the market (in Canada at least).  Neither I nor my doctor can get it anywhere.  I didn&#039;t have ANY side effects other than losing ugly fat.  

Bring this stuff back!  I know plenty of people who tried this and ALL loved it with great results.  Since being off Ionamin, I&#039;m back at 174 lbs.  There is nothing on the market like Ionamin. Please bring it back.""",3
Concerta,ADHD,"""My son was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 6.

We decided, based on a friend&#039;s advice (her daughter had success with concerta) to give it a shot. OMG! It was like night and day! Slight decrease in appetite initially, but other than that, it&#039;s been a godsend. Wishing all you parents the same success we had!!!!""",1

I do want to be positive with people but I have no sympathy with some comments on here that say I just took the pill it didn&#039;t work..... of course just taking a pill wont work its not a miracle pill. You need to workout and start eating much healthier on top of taking the medication. If you are obese like I was you need to have the healthy habits first I think and then take the pill.

Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication saved my life. Before, I was crying nonstop and having extreme fits of rage and woke up every day wanting to day. Now that I&#039;ve had it in my system for about 3 weeks, I don&#039;t feel perfect obviously but I feel much evened out. I&#039;m not euphoric but I&#039;m not severely depressed either and they don&#039;t switch from one another like they used to. For a long time I could barely sleep and now I can finally sleep through the night. I&#039;m much more rational and I feel that it&#039;s much easier to go about daily life and now I&#039;m finally working on repairing my relationships with people. Great drug""",6
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I have been taking 25 mg Amitriptyline for several years almost every night and really couldn&#039;t be more pleased and grateful. I call it my miracle cure for insomnia, as long as it&#039;s taken at the right time (9 pm). Too late in the evening it doesn&#039;t work very well. My initial dose of 50 mg caused too much postural syncope (dizziness upon standing). If I need to boost it, I can take 1mg melatonin, but I will have a later time to rise and a bit of a hangover. I initially took this drug for chronic dyspepsia and I suspect that routine use is keeping that at bay.""",0
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have a pinched nerve in my pelvis and for about a month I couldn&#039;t sit on the couch or a stool or even lay down in bed without severe pain in my lower back and even into my leg. My doctor put me on the tramadol and for the first time in over a month I was able to sleep with no pain. My only complaint is that it makes me feel incredibly itchy, I got great sleep, but I do remember rubbing and itching my face all night.""",9
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I started taking 50mg at night about a year ago. I love the sleep I receive on this medicine. I sleep deeply through the night without any crazy dreams.  I jump out of bed in the morning feeling refreshed and ready to start the day.  I only gave it an 8 rating because it has affected my sex life.  I cannot achieve an orgasm while on this medicine.  It is effecting my life tremendously. My doctor switched me to Ambien.  Hopefully that will help.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Vyvanse is hands down, in my opinion, the best ADHD medication out there. I was on Concerta from the ages of 7-13, then again from 20-21. I received genetic testing and it came back that my body doesn&#039;t metabolize Concerta very well. So the doctor gave me Adderall, which was too harsh with the come up and come down. Then made the switch to Vyvanse. Best decision. 

#1. You don&#039;t crash when you are on it. It has the smoothest come up and come down compared to Adderall and Concerta. 
#2. Vyvanse lasts a good 10-14 hours in the body 
#3. It has the longest duration of action
#4. It has low addiction potential 
#5. It also is the only one that helps manage my binge eating disorder""",1
Lexapro,Depression,"""To anyone taking Lexapro or any antidepressant:  DO NOT believe all the negative reviews you read here or elsewhere.  Do not let them scare you away from taking one of these drugs.  The drugs are not miracle workers, but they do help some by taking the edge off and by not letting you obsess on your feelings and thoughts.  You have to give them time, at least SIX WEEKS. If no improvement, up the dose per your Dr&#039;s permission or switch to another. The side effects are mild, and that is despite what anyone says to the contrary.  Antidepressants work best in combination with psychotherapy, but they are also effective when taken by themselves.  You will eventually feel better.""",5
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""Been taking benzodiazepines for near 10 years now. Started with 1mg of Lorazepam once daily, but it stopped working after about 2 years. I got prescribed Clonazepam 1mg twice daily.Worked like a charm for 5 years, then stopped having any effect. Still, Clonazepam is amazing compared to Lorazepam. This is an amazing medication. I was prescribed an up-dose (2mg three times daily, but I usually only took one pill a day or two, because 2mg is very strong). I was also prescribed Xanax to take along with Clonazepam due to having a panic disorder as well as generalized anxiety, but after about a year I decided that the Xanax was pretty useless (and tasted like wet chalk) so asked my psychiatrist to stop prescribing it. Just clonazepam. It&#039;s great.""",7
Adderall,ADHD,"""I am 62 years old on Adderall XL for ADD, on the medication for 4 years now. I find that Adderall does help when I first take it but seems to wear off as the day goes on. I get very sleepy while on the medication and have no problem with my appetite (no weight loss at all). I asked my Doctor to raise my dosage (I am taking 20mg per day) but he does not want to do it because of my age and concerns that it may affect my blood pressure, even though my pressure is normal now. I have no side effects at all from this medicine, just it is not helping my concentration as much as it did in the beginning, I think after a while the effectiveness wears off and an adjustment in dosage is needed.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am 60 years old and a career woman who has always struggled with completing tasks despite working long hours. Had recently succombed to depression and loss of self esteem because I was feeling I was no longer capable of performing my job because of age. Suffered this feeling most of my life,  been in therapy and was usually prescribed antidepressants or SSRI inhibitors to treat my symptoms but never cause of my symptoms. I did not even know adults could suffer from ADD. FINALLY a therapist took the time to treat the cause of my lifelong struggle instead of merely sedating me.  MY LIFE HAS CHANGED!! MY JOB PERFORMANCE AND PERSONAL LIFE HAS IMPROVED. I ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THINGS.  Why so late in life?""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Doctor prescribed a month ago.  Today is my first follow-up and I lost 14 lbs.  Initially, dry mouth, insomnia, and slight headache plagued me.  But after about 5 days, all of that subsided.  I only eat chicken, turkey, and white fish, veggies and fruit while working out for at least an hour, 4 days per week.  After a cup of black coffee in the morning, the only other drink all day is water.  I hope the progress continues.....goal is to lose 40 lbs and keep it off this time!""",3
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My adopted 13 y.o. son has fetal alcohol syndrome causing severe ADHD and failure to thrive. Has been on Concerta for four years. For years his special Education teachers let him run around in the halls to tire him out and lessen the hyperactivity. Even with the Concerta at 36 mg he was extremely hyper. He started Intuniv about a year ago, takes 3 mgs per day plus a reduced Concerta dose (18 mg). No side effects of note. He seems to be doing better hyperactivity wise in school, but I have not noticed a big difference at home. I also still have big problems with him homework-wise too. At 10 y.o. he weighed 60 lbs, with reduction in Concerta dose, he&#039;s finally gaining weight (13 y.o., 91 lbs) so that&#039;s the trade off we&#039;re making.""",1
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Implanon in July of 2009. A week later, I started my period which was far heavier than I normally get. I bled for the next month, but after that? Nothing! That is a blessing seeing as I have endometriosis and my periods were /extremely/ painful. I have a bit more acne than before and I think I&#039;ve gained a little weight, but all-in-all... I&#039;m thankful. I&#039;m pretty happy with it.""",8
Spironolactone,Acne,"""If you have acne that is likely hormone related (if it&#039;s not then this medicine won&#039;t help you) and you are taking spironolactone but are getting impatient, DON&#039;T GIVE UP!! I have been taking spironolactone 50 mg/day for about 4 months and finally started seeing results a few weeks ago. It really can help you, just be patient! My life is changed because of this medicine. No more painful, incessant cysts on my chin, no more piling on makeup trying to hide my acne, no more shutting myself in my house because I don&#039;t want to see anyone. I did have a BAD initial breakout, but now that I am seeing results, it was so worth it.""",4
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I started a 25mg dosage of spironolactone on the 24th of March 2017. Therefore, I&#039;ve been on this dosage for 2.5 months. In addition to my 25mg spironolactone dosage, I am also on the Yasmin contraceptive pill. The first 2 months of spironolactone were terrible. I was prepared for this (having read others&#039; experiences on these boards) but it was truly difficult. Spironolactone seemed my last port of call for hormonal acne and I was so frightened it just wouldn&#039;t work. Around a week ago, however, things started changing and my skin has definitely started clearing up. I&#039;ve had no new cysts forming and I anticipate my skin looking even better in a few weeks from now. My pores will always be big but I&#039;m hopeful the acne at least can stop.""",4
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on adipex for 11 months now and I&#039;ve dropped 117 pounds! I didn&#039;t exercise only took the pill and cut out everything bad (even though it taste good, doesn&#039;t always make it healthy for you) eating wise. Sugar, flour, bread, pastas, FASTFOOD, and even eating after a certain time. I started eating healthy snacks every two hours, ( egg whites, cottage cheese, bag of steamers vegetables, lots of chicken, belvita snacks, carrots and peanut butter etc,and drinking lots of water! Do this and I promise you&#039;ll drop weight immediately.""",2
Zoloft,Depression,"""I&#039;m a 44 yr. old female and I&#039;ve taken 50mg of Zoloft for 3 weeks now. I&#039;m grateful for it. It&#039;s helped depression, OCD, PTSD, anxiety, panic attacks, terrible thoughts, mood swings, and my urge to drink alcohol. The biggest relief of all is that it&#039;s helped my PMDD! I felt a weird feeling in my legs, at night, for a bit, but that seems to have gone away a few nights ago. I have dry mouth and chew gum to help. I feel lifted, happier, calmer, make better choices and feel clearer in my thought process and more alert and aware. Pre-menopause/PMDD, can cause you to feel like your going crazy...you&#039;re NOT, it is HORMONAL. Ask your doctor about this! Wish I had 4 yrs ago, it is working for me and maybe it can help others. Good luck!""",5
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I am 26 years old and having been using Concerta for approximately 9 months. I have been extremely impressed with my new ability to focus and attention to detail. I have always been a daydreamer and that paid off in creativity.  However, daydreaming during a meeting with the president of the company you work for doesn&#039;t pay off.  My wife, out of angst, suggested that I might have ADHD and should consider getting tested.  After a 5 hour psychological evaluation it was decidedly so.  Since I have started Concerta I have been promoted to the top position in my office.  It controls my anxiety and keeps me calm and focused.  The only side effects that I have noticed are weight loss (lost 30 lbs) due to loss of appetite and a lack of emotion.""",1
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I have to be in bed by 8 pm to get a full nights sleep for work early the next morning.  I&#039;ve never been able to fall asleep that early on my own, but Lunesta has been awesome.  It does not make me sleepy, but 15 minutes after taking it I lay down and just go to sleep.  At first I found I would wake up 4 or 5 hours later, but my doctor recommended taking melatonin with Lunesta.  Doing this (I take the 10mg time release melatonin) I sleep all night, easily wake up with the alarm clock, have no bad taste in my mouth, and am not groggy at all.  I do not take it on nights where I do not have to get up early the next day.""",0
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I started on Venlafaxine several months ago -- went from 37.4 to 75 to150mg. This was situational, as we had lost our 34-year old daughter several years ago in an extremely traumatic accident.   When I was taking 150 mg., I felt less anxious and depressed but foggy-headed, and my emotions have been blunted.  Over a short period of time, I experienced excruciating headaches, sleepiness, dry mouth, constipation, bizarre dreams, and felt detached from myself.  Under the guidance of my APRN, I&#039;ve been decreasing the dosage.  The weaning process has been difficult, and my memory is terrible.  I have now weaned to 37.5 mg. and will stay at this dose for a while. I have always been extremely sensitive to prescription meds; lower dose makes sense.""",7
Nubain,Pain,"""I received an injection cocktail of Nubain and Phenergren after suffering from a Migrane headache that had lasted for 6 days. I was in ER for 4 days before that and the injections they gave me there wore off and the pain was back.  I was prescribed Fiorcet and it helped to some degree, but the headache was back when the medicine wore off.  Once I received the Nubain, I&#039;ve only had to take 1 Fiorcet, and this morning, for the first time in a week, I&#039;ve been able to wake up with no pain.""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I am only in the middle of my second month taking isotretinoin but I have seen amazing results already! My first month I noticed I didn&#039;t have bad breakouts anymore and my skin was starting to heal. Since my dosage as doubled in my second month I can defiantly notice more side effects dry skin, nose bleeds/ scabbing, sore muscles/joints and dry/ red eyes but it is nothing too unbearable. I am just super happy I have found something that has worked! I am a moderate case of acne and I have almost gotten clear before even two months!""",4
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Latuda 80 mg for 8 months and am on no other medications for medication induced bipolar disorder which was caused by antidepressants prescribed for anxiety.  Latuda should be taken with 350 calories but when I took the medicine with food I was completely engulfed in anxiety within an hour.  Now I take it at night with no food.  I sleep for 12 hours at night and feel pretty good but am easily irritated.  I had the genetic testing which indicated that I MAY be a rapid metabolizer of this medicine so I&#039;m not sure if I am not getting enough of the medicine (because I am not taking it with food) and that is the cause of my irritability or if 80mg is causing irritability. """,6
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""I was prescribed this medication after I  already tried lithium and seroquel. The lithium helped me a lot &amp; the seroquel gave me bad headaches. So they put me on abilify. I could not sleep no matter what I took to help, I was restless , I threw up , my body temperature switched from hot to cold rapidly. I couldn&#039;t stand without being dizzy. It was the worst experience. My depression was better but my anxiety was insane. Definitely not worth the side effects""",5
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m 18. After a terrible experience on citalopram (antidepressant) to treat anxiety i was really reluctant to take any more medication,. I wanted to feel normal and be able to enjoy the company of others again, i bit the bullet and took 40mg propanolol and within in an hour, i was perfectly still and could concentrate on my work rather than the physical symptoms i could feel!! It also gave me cold hands and feet and breath, but i can more than deal with that!! I also have asthma but as long as i dont do anything too strenuous im fine. I also did a speech this week in a calm collected manner. Doesnt stop the cognitive symptoms like worrying but taking the physical symptoms stops the cycle in its tracks. So glad i was offered this drug.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got the nexplanon because I wasn&#039;t good at taking the pill and saw this as my best option. I was excited to start because I saw most reviews said no weight gain and it was the best birth control out there...WRONG. It does it&#039;s job in the birth control aspect, but 75% of that could be because I&#039;m always on my period. It has calmed down somewhat, but when it get it now it lasts 3-5 weeks. I have had small breasts my entire life and have gone up two cup sizes since then. I normally wouldn&#039;t complain but my breasts are ALWAYS very tender. I also have gained some weight and have trouble losing it. I&#039;m a vegetarian the majority of my diet is vegetables I should not have problems losing weight. I have scheduled my removal.""",8
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I went to my pain management doctor today &amp; he prescribed Gabapentin 300mg.  I have two tumors that sit on my sciatic nerve.....nights are very tough...can&#039;t sleep more than two hours at a time due to the pain.  I&#039;m hopeful that this will help in some way.  My doctor also told me I am a candidate for a pain stimulator.  This is to be inserted into my spine to send medication directly to the affected area and will help relieve me of the pain &amp; oral medications.  I&#039;m so tired of taking daily medications...this is a ray of hope for me.  15 years ago, I was told that I wasn&#039;t a candidate for this stimulator.  Thanks to the researchers  they&#039;ve made huge advancements and now......it&#039;s my turn!!!  Any thoughts?????""",9
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I have used this medicine for inner ear problems, dizziness, that causes anxiety  for 15 years 1.5 mg per day along with 100mg of Zoloft  with very little side efects. It has helped me live with stress and anxiety that I had with my ear problem. Yes the Doctors don&#039;t know why this helps with inner ear problem, but that is O.K. it works. I know that Doctors are concerned about abuse and that sure can happen to a addictive person. I have never used more than what has been prescribed to me.  This may some day come back to hurt me, but I am 72 now and it has significantly improved my quality of life. Any questions you want ask me. At rutoft64@gmail.com""",7
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""After 20 years of every SSRIs for depression and generalized anxiety disorder I have found that Gabapentin is the only medicine that has really helped the anxiety with the exception of Thioridizane (now withdrawn in UK). At first Seroquel seemed to help but 3 months now on Gabapentin and significantly better. Still haven&#039;t found the ideal dose (now about 2400 a day) but initial side effects have worn off. My family say that since coming off Seroquel my personality has returned to what it used to be years ago. Give it a good try, and good luck. If you post on here I do think it helps if you mention dosage (and body weight 224lbs).""",7
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""My 15 yo son who has innattentive ADHD was taking adderall since 7th grade.  He is now in 10th.  For the longest  time  he has been having anger issues, he is easily  irritated by other students talking in class, noise on the bus, and his  7 year  old sister.  I was desperately searching online for meds to help with anger with ADHD and asp and found this site. Reading all the  comparisons of adderall and dexedrine, others having the same situation and most improving on the dex I hoped  that his problem was the adderall.  Went  to the doctor told her all of the above.  She seemed a little skeptical about it but was willing  to give it a try.  I don&#039;t  want to jinx myself or my son but so far so good even helped sister with homework.""",1
Butrans,Pain,"""The best medicine I have taken so far for control of sacroiliac joint pain.  I have been on Oxycontin, Percocet and this patch works better.  The side effects are tolerable.  My only complaints are severe bloating and constipation.  You really have to stay on top of taking a laxative or you will be in bad shape.  But you cannot beat the pain control.  The patch enables me to work full-time at a professional job and remain comfortable..""",9
Endocet,Pain,"""I have been dealing with lower back and leg pain for the last year and half. I was started with Oxys 5mg. It took awhile to figure out how much I needed to make through a day. It could be anywhere from 2 to 8 daily and never had any problem working. My script was change to Percs. 5mg. and they seem to work a lot better and only needed at most 4 per day, but I had a hard time trying to work. My last script was for Endocet 10mg. I took one before I went to bed and the next day waking up was real hard to do things like talking. I&#039;m only using a 1/2 of one at a time at this point and on a good day just a half on a bad day 1 &amp; 1/2.""",9
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I first started on Latuda at 20 mg two years ago and then my psychiatrist upped it to 80 mg over a month ago. I do not the same irritability and agitation like I had when I was on 60 mg and small things that rubbed me the wrong way before do not have the same affect on me now. I also take Wellbutrin 300 mg and Viibyrd 20 mg in combination with Latuda. All together I now feel more stable than I have since I was 16, and I am now 23.""",6
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I have been on several medications (citalopram) &amp; after 6   years it simply stopped helping my anxiety. It made me tired, foggy &amp; spacey anyways. I had a hard time being sharp at my corporate job. I then got off of anything and was just ok for 7 months. Then my spouse almost died and it sent me reeling into depression &amp; severe anxiety. I was paralyzed with fear. I couldn&#039;t get my work done, cried all the time, had major anxiety. I was afraid to try anything due to the fear of being tired, foggy or dull. Started 30mg Cymbalta. It helped me within 3 days. First 3 days was nauseous. After 2 weeks I was no longer depressed, no catastrophic thinking or panic attacks. Wish I had tried 10-20 years ago! It has turned me around. Not foggy or tired!""",7
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve started on the 10 mg. So far so good. I got the first 10 for free. I&#039;ve tried it with other sleep meds, it seems to perform better with a small amount of Halcion. I think it would perform as good by itself maybe at 
15 mg. I&#039;m going to try one more round of 10 tabs (likely the 15 mg). I don&#039;t think anything past 20 mgs,
would be advisable. I also have little or no hang over as long as I dose around 10 pm and wake up at 7 am.
I rate it an 8 right now because it requires a lot of forethought to stay on schedule. It&#039;s about as effective as halcion but you reach more rem state sleep and experience very little amnesia like one would on halcion.""",0
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""The WORST night of my life. I can only imagine that this would be what someone would experience if they took hallucinogenic drugs.  HORRIBLE nightmares, a sensation that my chest and arms were being restricted, burning.  Woke after every VIOLENT nightmare, trying to forget what I&#039;d just dreamt. 
Headache this morning and TOTAL recall of a night filled with terrible dreams. I am throwing this away!!!!!""",0
Oxycodone,Pain,"""In 2000 I had 4 surgeries to repair an anal fistula.  The surgeries were successful in that they did repair the fistula but they also left me in severe chronic pain.  Pain in the rectum area is very difficult to treat.  I&#039;ve been to numerous doctors in Columbus, where I live and only 2 were willing to prescribe Oxycontin.  When I was taking the Oxycontin the pain was much better and I could actually sit down at a desk and do a job.  Then the last doctor took me off because I&#039;d been taking them for so long and now I can&#039;t find a doctor to prescribe them again.  Consequently I&#039;m back to suffering with terrible pain because doctors are afraid to prescribe Oxcontin in Ohio unless the patient has cancer, which I don&#039;t.""",9
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I tried cymbalta right after I gave birth and I noticed a difference within days. My.mood swings before my period get very bad and I thought the medicine wasn&#039;t working anymore so I switched to prozac. Big.mistake. I couldn&#039;t get out of bed. I switched back to cymbalta and am on day 2 and feel good. Never had side effects or anything like that. This has always been fast acting and an overall good medicaton for depression and my anxiety.""",7
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I have been taking Belviq for 1 month, but I&#039;m going to stop because the side effects are too much.  The first week I experienced extreme dizziness, fatigue and muscle soreness.  I powered through and the dizziness finally went away.  However, the extreme fatigue and muscle soreness was too much.  I tried only one pill a day, but it didn&#039;t help the side effects.  I stopped taking Belviq three days ago and the muscle soreness is completely gone and the fatigue is better.  I was so tired I couldn&#039;t even work a full day and didn&#039;t have the energy to hardly walk.  However, it was effective at weight loss.  I lost 4% of my body weight the first month.""",2
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""I am a 57 year old male who struggled through five years of college and finally gave up without getting a degree.  At home I would start projects and never finish them.  In my early forties, I finally earned a BS degree out of sheer determination.  My wife, who is a psychologist, gave me an IQ test and found that my IQ is rather high.  I started asking myself, &quot;Why have I been an under-achiever for most of my life?&quot;   My wife suggested that I might have ADD.  I started taking Adderall XR 20mg about 6 years ago which changed my life for the better. I am now able to finish things that I start.  Plus, I don&#039;t procrastinate nearly as much.

Melatonin,Insomnia,"""So I&#039;ve been ill for 16 yrs, autoimmune, so needless to say insomnia is part of the equation here, since I don&#039;t absorb anything properly I take is liquid or sublingual. I take 3mg sublingual dots they work like a charm, if it&#039;s a bad night I take 2. But that&#039;s just me. Also the blue light on your cell and Desktop computer lowers your Melatonin and causes you to lose sleep. Look for an app to filter that out that should help tremendously... sweet dreams""",0
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I have been taking Prozac 20 mg for about a month.  I went through a divorce last year, which was stressful, and still is.  I was staying stressed out, cried a lot, had a negative attitude, and wasn&#039;t sleeping.  I went to my doctor and she prescribed Prozac to take every morning and Ambien, which is only has needed.  It took about 7-10 days, but I can tell a difference.  I don&#039;t feel all stressed out anymore, I handle problems and situations better.  I haven&#039;t cried at all since taking it, not sure how I feel about that.  I just kinda feel like I&#039;m on an even-keel, so to speak.  Haven&#039;t had any real side effects from the Prozac.  I like taking it, and will probably stay on it for a while.""",5
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I personally have not taken this medication but my mother has. I am 19 and she started taking it when I was 12. It for the most part helped her insomnia but the side effects were extreme. I would have to stay up until she had fallen asleep because if I didn&#039;t she would do things and not remember them the next morning. She would take our dog for a walk in the dark at 10 at night by herself. There was one occasion where she woke up on our neighbors cement front porch with our dog. She had no recollection of how she got there. She would eat strange things like vineager and ketchup chicken quesadillas, she would fall down the stairs, she would lose things, and she got very addicted. Coming off it was horrible. The night terrors were insane""",0
Copper,Birth Control,"""I have had the paragard for about 6 months.  Insertion was uncomfortable but not bad.  My first period with the iud was unbearable I cramped severely for 1 day.  And I had heavy bleeding for 3days. 4 normal bleeding days.  Then I spotted till my next period on and off.  My following periods since then have not been bad.  I barely cramp.  But I do have heavier bleeding.  My periods last a week.  I thought  my periods were going to be awful and that I would have bad cramps and bleeding would be really heavy.   Before the iud my periods were 3 days and pretty light.  So maybe that&#039;s why my periods w/ Iud aren&#039;t as bad?  I also use the period cup instead of tampons cuz they give me cramps.So maybe thats why I can&#039;t complain about the iud.""",8
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had my Mirena put in a little over 3 months ago. I&#039;m 24 years old and have no children nor have I ever been pregnant. The procedure to put in the IUD was very painful for me and although it only took 10 minutes it felt like forever. That being said I feel like it would have been better if my doc would have told me that it would hurt worse than just &quot;mild cramping&quot; and I would have taken a better painkiller other than the 200mg of Advil she suggested. That first night was almost unbearable and the next two weeks were not much better. I spot bled for about a week until I got my period which lasted for 13 days. After that however, the cramps stopped and so did my period. I think it was worth the pain at first for the convenience of no pill.""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had this implanted so that I never had to think about taking a birth control at a certain time and everything like that, so in that respect it is great. However my periods have become virtually untrackable. At first I had no period for like three months and then all of the sudden I had light ones for a couple of days, within a week of each other. This happens all the time, either I have a period or I don&#039;t; either its super heavy, and I feel awful between bloating, headaches, body aches for a couple of days; or I have a very light and spotty period for a week and a half where its impossible for plan for. I have had no consistency with periods which is very tiring, annoying and frustrating. I also sometimes get a pain around the area.""",8
Bupropion,Depression,"""I am an 18 year old female. I started taking Wellbutrin about 7 months ago for depression/anxiety. Honestly, I haven&#039;t noticed much of a difference. I think it has helped me control my emotions a bit more though/feel more stable. I&#039;ve just started my first year of college and I&#039;ve had a rough time but I think the WB helps keep my meltdowns to a minimum (sort of). I was hoping to lose a bit of weight but I didn&#039;t really notice any loss of appetite. I&#039;ve DEFINITELY noticed that if forget to take it for a day I feel absolutely miserable. Even if I take it a bit off schedule I feel sad for a day. Also, if I drink a bit too much, my hangover is AWFUL and I feel very sad the next day. Keep the drinking to a minimum or don&#039;t.""",5
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""IF you use this drug JUDICIOUSLY, it can a God send.  I take 1 mg 3 to 4 times a week, never passing 5 (and rarely hitting 5).  99% of the time I take it right at bedtime to get a bomb sleep.  The next day, the world is beautiful.  I am lucky; I can feel the drug working for 13 hours every time.  And when it wears off, I still feel superb.  I am a better person with this inexpensive medication in my life!

I have been taking ativan for 10 years.  The routine above has been consistently done for 3 years.  Consider a low dose SSRI; I have been taking 10 mg of Cipralex/Lexapro for 18 months.  I wish I had this figured out years ago!  Good Luck.""",7
Dapsone,Acne,"""I have been experiencing cystic acne for about 3 months now. My doctor had put on adaphlene cream and doxy antibiotic pills the first 2 months which basically purge out all sorts of acne. I was aware that it takes roughly 12 weeks to see results but I was just getting worse. My doctor ended up referring me to a Dermatologist who told me to continue with the adaphlene cream 0.1% at night. He took me off of the doxy antibiotic and prescribe me the minocycline 50mg 2 times a day and Aczone gel 7.5 once day as well as wash my face with Benozoyl Peroxide wash. The acne is almost gone after only being on the new medications 2 weeks. All I have left now is the horrible hyperpigmentation from the acne and it seems to be fading gradually too.""",4
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""Have had generalized and social anxiety for as long as I can remember. Was on Klonopin 1.0 to 1.5 mg twice a day (about 15 years) along with propranolol 20 mg twice a day. I decided at the beginning of this year that I was going to try to wean myself off Klonopin as getting a script every month for Klonopin is a pain. I started Remeron 5 months ago at 15mg than 22.5mg and in no time my anxiety level went down. I was also on Vyvanse to counter depression from long term Klonopin which I replaced with Wellbutrin. With Remeron/Wellbutrin combination I am down to 0.5mg twice a day Klonopin which I never dreamed was possible. I plan on going on Lyrica or Neurontin to help wean off Klonopin for good.""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am a high school student (10 grade). Today was my first day taking Vyvanse and I feel like a totally different person! I was very stressed about school because I couldn&#039;t concentrate and making bad grades isn&#039;t fun so it made me a little depressed. I noticed that I actually felt like doing work (never thought that would happen) and instead of finishing my episode of Teen mom 2 I was eager to do my homework instead! At night I got about an hour of sleep then was up for about 8 hours until it was time to go to school and I forgot to eat the whole day it&#039;s just food didn&#039;t sound good at all and it gave me so much energy especially because we had to run the mile at school and I ran it very fast because it changes your whole mindset.""",1
Copper,Birth Control,"""After 6 months with this IUD I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. I HAD to have it removed. I have never ever in my life dealt with depression/anxiety/panic attacks until I got the Copper IUD. (Before the IUD my periods were fairly light and 4-5 days on average. Light PMS. Some back pain) with the IUD  they were 7-8 days. So heavy I had to wear a pad and a jumbo tampon and change every 2 hours HORRIBLE cramping to where my only relieve was laying in bed curled up with heating pad. Midol/Tylenol rarely made a difference. Around my time of PMS I would suddenly feel very very depressed and sooo fatigue. And then my mind would race into a downward spiral where I would then panic I would feel this way forever.... Glad to have this out &amp; be me again!!!!""",8
Neurontin,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Neurontin at 1800-2100 mg/day after a nightmare trial on Seroquel. It felt like I was jettisoned up out of a deep, dark hole. Everyone comments on how I am myself again, and I agree. It also helps with nerve pain, sleep, and definitely stabilized my moods. I have only gained 3 pounds, and I attribute that more to the fact I am eating again at all (don&#039;t eat when cycling). This medicine is easily metabolized and has few drug interactions. I am grateful that my doctor recommended it, as well as the Cleveland Clinic. It has been around since 1998, so I think we are good to go.""",6
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""Works well, does it&#039;s job, but be warned, for the first few days - week, the side effects are freaking horrible. I was on Wellbutrin for a half a year, but got off due to having a rare side effect (muscle &amp; joints hurting). Trying Strattera now, and as far as I can tell, it&#039;s very nice. Thoughts are organized, and I feel more relaxed (which is good because I might have anxiety - still being determined), none the less I get a lot more things done. Side effects are a bloody nightmare - hang in there! They do go away! I started on only 25MG and for 4 days I was nauseous &amp; had to lay down from time to time, couldn&#039;t stop sleeping, &amp; my eyes were hurting... weird... I went up to 50MG, and again, the same symptoms.""",1
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I have had insomnia related to anxiety for about 6 years,  exasperated by shift work and taking Citalopram. Took me ages to fall asleep (some nights couldn&#039;t sleep at all and this induced panic attacks) and waking atleast 3 times throughout the night. Finally referred to a sleep disorder service by NHS (uk) and my consultant prescribed this at 15mg. I fall asleep within an hour of taking usually. It has really helped! Feels like a nice natural sleepy state and not overly drowsy like you can get with sleeping pills. Reduced amount of times I wake also. However, I now have cold sweats every morning which wakes me up, they start from around 6am and continue till I wake up. Going to see my doc about this as they are becoming unbearable.""",0
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""Horrible aftertaste that lasts at least 8 hours. The taste comes about 5 mins after I take it and that&#039;s when I know it&#039;s working.  Otherwise I can&#039;t tell like I could taking another popular sleeping medicine. It&#039;s increased my depression and anxiety. I&#039;m getting put back on my previous medication in three days due to the horrible after taste. It&#039;s chemical tasting. Nasty.""",0
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been treated with lithium for a little over 30 days. Received results from blood work and increased dosage. Only side effect I notice are vivid nightmares. They&#039;re just dreams, so I&#039;m not really concerned. I still struggle with anger from time to time, or short fits of rage, followed by regret and self loathing, a common cycle for me. Trying to remain optimistic. Finding myself wanting to isolate more and more. I know this is not healthy. Looking for some positive feedback and/or suggestions.
Thanks""",6
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Lamictal for hmm... ~5 months now. I feel it has seriously been one of the most helpful things in my life. I feel very present to the moment, mostly calm, and overall.. content. It basically just improves my personality. Some side effects though. Terrible memory. Seriously. My perception of time is all out of whack too. I said I have been taking it for only 5 months but that is so hard to believe! It feels like I&#039;ve on it for at least a year. Oh well. I still like it because lifestyle doesn&#039;t require a sharp memory. If your lifestyle does require sharpness I advise against taking this.""",6
Lutera,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve used about 3 different brands of birth control and this one is by far the worst. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. I took a break from pills for a couple months and when I started back up, I started using Lutera. I&#039;ve been using it for 4-5 months and I feel horrible. I CAN say that It does a great job at protecting from birth and my periods haven&#039;t been a problem at all, but I feel horrible. I don&#039;t feel like myself at all. I feel disconnected/groggy almost all the time. My libido is completely gone now. Mood swings. I&#039;ve been so unlike myself for the past few months so I&#039;ve decided to stop taking them.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I posted a few weeks back , and was doing great on the contrave, a few things started happening and I seriously thought something was wrong with me.. after getting up to the full dose of 4 a day, I started experiencing a lot of things that were not common side effects, Back pain, severe abdominal pain, severe sleepiness, I could not hold my eyes open after sleeping 8 hours , then very frequent and uncomfortable urinating, after researching the products more these were all rare side effect and I was experiencing them all, I had to come off, I hurt all the time and all I wanted to do was sleep.. was weird is I had no nausea the other common side effects, it works different on different people..  just going to have to lose on my own...""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had it for almost 2 years and have not became pregnant...so yes, it is effective..at a cost. My sex drive is gone and it&#039;s making my life horrible! My moods are  ridiculous. I have depression, anxiety irrability. Patience...what patience?! My weight is up and down I feel bloated. I get pregnancy symptoms; cravings. Really bad headaches and abdominal pain. I thought it would eventually subside but NOPE! Less than a week until removal...so so happy!""",8
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I see a lot of negative experiences on here. Fortunately, I won&#039;t add to those. 
This is day 8 after beginning Belviq, and I have lost 8 pounds!!!I started the RX as prescribed: twice a day, 12 hours apart. I have to make myself eat. When I do, I only eat a very small portion. My meals are only about 200 calories each, with 3 tiny snacks. I cut back on all sugar (even Splenda).  **Cravings are non existent&quot; 
I am 57, I have COPD, and 2 herniated discs, so it&#039;s hard to exercise normally. But I am increasing activities, and doing back exercises, and walking when I am able. Will add weights when my back feels more stable. 
I have had absolutely no side effects! No headaches, no muscle aches, no drowsiness, nothing. 
I couldn&#039;t be happier.""",3
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""My Dr. made it sound like the greatest thing I could ever do for myself. The procedure ended up being way more painful than I&#039;d been prepared for, then I had 3 days of unbearable cramps (I could barely move). About another 3-4 weeks of increasingly less severe cramps. Since then, I&#039;ve had no real periods but a lot of unpredictable spotting and light bleeding, as well as cramping, that lasts for upwards of 3 weeks on end, sometimes with only one week in between. I&#039;ve also completely lost my sex drive and have been feeling overwhelmingly emotional for the last few months, on the verge of tears constantly (how I used to feel for about 2 days before a regular period). Been 5 months and I want it OUT. This is HELL.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I didn&#039;t give it a 10 as I have only been on it a week now, just started doubling up. But my appetite and cravings went away as soon as I started the medicine. I do have constipation, but I eventually go. Hoping it wares off, no headaches or nausea. Day 2 of doubling up and I just feel as I did when I took 1 , just the effect of my suppressed appetite just lasts longer. Which is great bc I don&#039;t snack at night anymore which was a huge thing for me. I haven&#039;t weighed myself, I&#039;m going to wait after the 1st month until I see me
Dr again. I like this combo of meds because I do feel happier from the buprorion and my appetite is suppressed and cravings for sweets are no longer there. It&#039;s crazy how the receptors in your mind can change like that.""",2
Nuvigil,Bipolar Disorde,"""Third day on this medicine, it&#039;s crazy how things are going. I used to wake up and an hour later be exhausted. Barely make it through 2 hours of college and go home and sleep 5 hours until work and sleep right after work. The past couple of days I&#039;ve been able to stay awake through a movie, stay up for my favorite T.V show, do homework and laundry after school, be more attentive at my job and I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m on speed.""",6
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for depression for two and a half years. My doctor titrated me up to 120mg. I was at 120mg for over two and a half years and almost constantly I was severely depressed, severe anxiety, some paranoia, no energy, over reaction, self harm, extreme anger, just to name a few. That&#039;s not to say I do have some of those problems normally, but not as severe or as constant. So Cymbalta was overlooked as a cause to my worsening issues. Two weeks ago I was admitted into an inpatient hospital to basically save my life. While I was in there I was abruptly taken off, then titrated up to 60mg. I&#039;m a totally different person now. I did a complete 180&deg;. I can&#039;t believe what a difference it makes being on the right dose.""",5
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""It&#039;s not for me at all. Last night was the worst night of my life, it started about two weeks into taking Lexapro my friends and family said that they noticed changes but I felt more depressed than I have ever felt. The next two weeks into it I started feeling really off balance and trembly. Then last night happened, without warning, without a trigger, as I was trying to fall asleep I started getting lost in my head. I was forgetting how to think and I was forgetting words. It terrified me. """,7
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I am 18 years old and weigh about 120 pounds. I got in the Depo-Provera shot July 2013. When I went to get the shot the nurse told me I may have no weight gain or cravings. She also told me to take 1200 calcium everyday. The day after I got the shot I felt like I had the flu the whole day was miserable. As the first month was bad. My body ached &amp; I felt sick to my stomach about every week.. The second month I was sick about 3 days a week with my body hurting &amp; sick to my stomach. I also lost my urge to eat.  Throughout the 3 months I was moody my friends &amp; family couldn&#039;t stand to be around me. I gained maybe 2 pounds. """,8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I read the Accutane horror stories, so I turned down my dermatologists suggestion of it. After 4 more years (25 now), the cystic acne has just been getting worse and worse. It was seriously impacting my life. I just finished a month ago doing a 5 month 60mg/day treatment and my skin is flawless. I cannot believe it. I actually have better skin than people who I once thought had beautiful perfect skin. I experienced some joint pain the first month and dry lips the entire time, but I started seeing reductions in acne by month 2 and had no new cysts by month 4. There are still a few that are healing (yes, I would get some cysts that take 6-8 months to heal). I would highly recommend this. I have so much of my life back not worrying about skin.""",4
Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorde,"""3 years after being diagnosed with Bipolar 1, I was put on 2 mg of Rivotril to be taken at night following a car accident. When it was prescribed, I was in a poor state of mental health and was suffering from extreme agitation and horrible nightmares. After taking clonazepam for a while, I noticed that not only did it calm agitation, but it helped stabilize my mood. It has made my mood more consistent and improved it dramatically. I consistently feel calm, positive, and mentally stable. I&#039;ve been prescribed other benzodiazepines in the past, but clonazepam has by far been the most effective. Overall, an excellent medication also considering that it isn&#039;t subject to metabolite accumulation.""",6
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Ok, to begin with: Vyvanse has dramatically improved my life. I am a 20 year old college student and I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19. I have always been a bright student, cheerful person and an overall hard worker but Vyvanse has &quot;improved&quot; me. I feel that it allows me to monitor and control my thoughts and actions in a way I never seemed to be able to before. Effects I experience from Vyvanse: Improved concentration, ability to focus clearly on a subject or task at hand, ability to switch focus and not &quot;obsess&quot;, improvements in grades, &amp; ability to plan/schedule/prioritize activities. In the end I feel like Vyvanse has made the dream me reality, I can finally accomplish my goals.""",1
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed .5mg to be taken 2 times daily for anxiety. At first I would only take a single .5mg dose every once in a while if I had an anxiety issue, which seemed to help a bit. Well, last week I was anxious most of the week so I decided to take a single, .5mg dose once a day for 4 days straight. Boy was that a bad idea!!! 2 days after stopping, my anxiety symptoms skyrocketed multiple times worse than before I even started the medicine. I had severe withdrawal symptoms for over a week after and didn&#039;t know a dependence could be gained in such a short period of time. My psychiatrist even said it was nearly impossible for that short a period at that dose. I won&#039;t continue this medication. Beware!""",7
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the Liletta inserted on October 3rd. I was expecting the insertion to be excruciating after reading tons of reviews but it wasn&#039;t bad at all. It was definitely uncomfortable but it was just mostly cramps and I have a very low tolerance for pain. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate the insertion pain a 3. I did take 800mg of ibuprofen and a muscle relaxer a hour before my appt. I&#039;ve had pretty intense cramps off and on everyday. My doctor prescribed tramadol which I just started today. I take ibuprofen and that helps a lot, as long as I take it before the pain is really bad. I bled every day but it stopped 3 days ago. It was regular bleeding and then brown discharge, which is annoying. Overall I think it will help me in the long run.""",8
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been on this medicine for over 3 months now and it has been a lifesaver for me, I take three 5mg diazepam a day about every 6 hours and I no longer have the panic attacks, depression has decreased 90%, I sleep at night since my brain can finally shut down, I have hardly any horrible thoughts anymore which plagued me before always worrying that something bad would happen to my kids or family members, I also don&#039;t have to get up to go to the bathroom 4-5 times a night anymore. My Dr also started me on Lexapro 3 months ago but I haven&#039;t noticed any effects from taking it since the diazepam is so helpful.""",7
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was put on 80 mg twice a day. Couldn&#039;t handle that so I started taking both at night. I&#039;ve been on for 4 years and THEN the side effects started bad dystonia in my legs, arms, and face. Also I was very depressed, felt hallow, and so snappy always yelling at my kids. No ability to cry (you know sometimes a good cry just helps).  So I called my doctor and she cut it in half to 80. At first I had some mood swings but I have gotten them under control. Now I just ache all over and have bad headaches. But, on the lighter side, I feel much happier, not scared of people like I was before (because I was sure they were all talking about me and hated me).  I haven&#039;t decided if I&#039;m going to go off or compltley. Right now, I&#039;m happy where I&#039;m at.""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""A horrible experience!
I am 38, was on OrthoCyclen for 10+ Yrs, have 2 kids. The family planning clinic urged me to get an IUD &amp; I was excited to try it.

INSERTION: excruciating, WAY worse than childbirth! I have a high pain tolerance, but even w/15mg Oxy+Tramadol 100mg, I almost fainted, begging her to stop. I&#039;m small, 5&#039;7&quot;, 114 lbs, tiny pelvis w/tilted cervix, maybe this made it worse.

SIDE EFFECTS: awful :(
-painful gums (hormones affect dental health)
-severe headaches daily
-peri-oral dermatitis (Face rash)
-too much severe pain all day every day to even think about sex
-WORST is constant cramps referring pain down my leg
-blood/spotting

Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got my Skyla put in 4 weeks ago. 23 years old. I am writing on here because I thought many reviews I read were very misleading, and I was very nervous beforehand, which I realize was not necessary.

First things first: Everyone&#039;s body is different! Some people are bound to have different experiences - so take every review with a grain of salt.

Insertion felt like a pretty severe cramp for about 5 minutes, but nothing that bad. Take Ibuprofen an hour before. I spotted for 2 weeks after, nothing serious. I have been getting random stomach pains / cramps -- maybe 1/2 times a week. Nothing too severe, its just caught me off guard.

I will write again in a few months, but as of right now, very happy with it.""",8
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Been on Vyvanse for three months now. I&#039;m 6 foot 195 pounds and 20 years old but find even the 30 mg dosage to be more than enough for me. Experience occasional bouts of dizziness and when in stressful situation have some degree of chest pains. Lasts more than the full 12 hours for me. I have to wake up at 8 am in order to fall asleep around 1 AM.  Also when I take Vyvanse I notice some degree of hair loss. I feel as if my brain is telling my body to work and as a result my body is working in triple overtime to keep up.""",1
Tramadol,Depression,"""Like many of the reviewers here I discovered the benefits of the medicine for depression by accident. It had been prescribed for back pain after I hurt by back lifting a heavy bag out of the car trunk at the airport. Yes, it helped in a with the back pain from 
the injury but it totally destroyed my depression immediately. It works in less than 1 hour and you will feel uplifted and hopeful .If you suffer from depression talk with your Dr.  about Tramadol. Plain and simple...it works and works fast. No kidding this is a depression killer.""",5
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I used to have panic attacks every time we went out to eat, I couldn&#039;t sit in the movies without a panic attack, I couldn&#039;t travel without anxiety and eventually a panic attack. I was always in a state of panic. I went to the urgent care with heart palps, and was given a script for clonazepam .05mg and I take it once at night. I finally sleep through the night, I don&#039;t wake up groggy, and it lasts throughout the next day because I can do the things I Never was able to do before. I use it with caution because I don&#039;t want to become dependent but at the same time, I wasn&#039;t really functioning very well before. I am thankful for it!""",7
OxyContin,Pain,"""I was on every pain medicine imaginable and even Oxycontin for a few years. At first I thought it was the &#039;wonder medicine&#039; people talk about. After a while though, it caused me more problems than it was worth. The strange thing was, if I took the normal (prescribed) dose, I would actually feel like I had more pain than if I didn&#039;t take it at all, so I was always trying to take more because if I didn&#039;t take it I had withdrawals. Then I was always caught trying to take more to avoid the pain or the withdraw. I finally got away from that and started taking methadone. A very small dose of methadone does fine with absolutely no side affects, no withdrawals if I don&#039;t need it that day, and no chasing the pain away.""",9
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I started taking the generic version 6 months ago.  I had to go to my doctor every two weeks for a weigh-in and to &quot;earn&quot; another prescription (had to show some weight loss).  The first two days were the hardest with nausea.  I felt tired but had insomnia. I did lose 9 lbs the first 2 weeks, but after that I have only lost about 1-1.5 lbs/week.  I began working out 3-4 times a week for 30 minutes to improve muscle tone and cardio fitness. The dry mouth and constipation were bad, so I began taking the pill every other day which really helped. I did not notice any increase in appetite.  So far I have lost 40 lbs.  My Doctor is thrilled and said I can continue with skipping 2-3 days. I plan on stopping when I hit 50 lb loss. I want to lose 100lbs total.""",2
Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,"""I recently got married so my husband and I started discussing different birth control methods and decided on the pill. I have suffered from acne since I was 13 and when I found Ortho Tri-Cyclen, approved to treat acne, I thought it would be a good pill for me to try. My experience on Ortho so far has been positive. I have been on the pill for three months (my third pack) and have had no negative side effects. I have been happier, haven&#039;t gained any noticeable weight, no mood swings, way lighter/shorter periods, no pregnancy, and larger breast. I&#039;m a bit disappointed because my acne has only slightly improved but hasn&#039;t worsened. Maybe if I remain on the pill longer my acne will completely disappear. Overall I&#039;m happy and will remain on Ortho Tri Cyclen.""",4
Paxil,Depression,"""Bipolar, ADHD, OCD, etc. Many of the symptoms overlap and crossover into each other and others as well. Depression is found in each condition, and I find for myself that depression is by far the most debilitating condition of all. I first tried Paxil 12 years ago for depression and anxiety. The Paxil worked great. The side effects included a little nausea (which is basically eliminated by eating something with or soon after taking the med) and some sexual issues (which I believe can be negotiated after you get used to the Paxil). I quit taking it when I switched insurance and because of the perceived stigma I had with taking anything for conditions I didn&#039;t want to even acknowledge. Now I&#039;m back on it and will keep it up!""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Day 4 on Phen, haven&#039;t lost 1 ounce! I know that&#039;s not a lot of time but I see most people lose right away. Even if it&#039;s just water weight, I expected to lose at least a lb. It does do a great job at suppressing my appetite. Maybe too good. I don&#039;t eat very much because I am just not hungry. Hoping I see some results soon!! Dry mouth is annoying and I am tired most of the day but awake at night.""",3
Zoloft,Depression,"""I&#039;m 19 and Zoloft has been a LIFESAVER for me! I&#039;ve had very bad generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, and mild depression. I recently had been on Xanax then Klonopin as needed, but I felt as if those types of medications wouldn&#039;t help me in the long run. I&#039;ve been on 25 mg of Zoloft for a month and a half, and I feel WONDERFUL! The horrible, disabling anxiety I once had is almost nonexistent, and my depression melted away! My mood is stabilized, I have a lot of energy, focusing on school work is a synch, and I interact with others with confidence. Yes, I feel like a totally renewed, cleansed person with a constant sense of motivation! Zoloft saved my life! Little to no side effects either. Very mild antidepressant.""",5
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I love my gabapentin I currently take 800mgs 4 daily I&#039;ve been taking them for around 4 years... my whole family suffers from anxiety and my mother was the first to take it who recommended me to tell my doc because antidepressant just didn&#039;t work for me. So I asked and I&#039;m glad I did.. I watched my whole family also abuse xanax and I refused to go down that road. So I&#039;m perfectly happy with it""",7
Bupropion,Depression,"""The first few days while taking Wellbutrin,which is not really recommended for anxiety but doc recommended giving it a try, were not too bad.  Around week 2 I began to notice I was miserable, angry all the time, and just not feeling like  myself!  I am usually a happy person that laughs alot and enjoys making others laugh!  Wellbutrin changed all that!  I was now a bitter and angry person that found fault with everything!  I wasn&#039;t sleeping well, had slight headaches everyday and my head felt cloudy and foggy all the time!  I wasn&#039;t able to concentrate which made it difficult for me to function properly at work. I was no longer the happy,silly person I used to be!  This drug totally changed my personality!""",5
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve taken Aleve and Vicodin for my sciatica pain with limited results. Taking lorazepam completely rids me of my hip/leg/back pain which is wonderful! I still have to remind myself to be easy on my hip and not try and clean the whole house because my pain is gone. I half a 1mg tablet so it doesn&#039;t sedate me. My intent is to not be completely knocked out. I want to be productive and it allows me that luxury. I know it&#039;s not generally prescribed for pain like this, but it sure as hell works for mine. I&#039;ve had no adverse side effects and it really helps me get through the day without constant pain.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got this implant 3 1/2 months after having my first child. I had lost nearly all my baby weight and was continuously losing, that is until I had this put in. I have gained 25 lbs and no matter what can not lose it. Also my face started to break out around a month after getting the implant and just keeps getting worse. The worst side effect is I spot at least 25 days a month, sometimes I will bleed up to 3 months straight, stop for 2 or 3 days then start bleeding again. I have also noticed a rapid decrease in sex drive and in the last 6 months less sensitive and I have a very hard time getting turned on,  which is probably the cause of the lack of sensitivity. 
I had implanon for 3 years and loved it but I hate nexplanon.""",8
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I have been on oxycontin for 6 years now.  I take 20mg 2 x a day along with a couple of other medicines. Before oxycontin, I was on 14 or more prescriptions that didn&#039;t work. I was ready to give up.  Now, my pain from Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue along with several surgeries is tolerable. Every now and then I forget to take my oxycontin in the morning and my body reminds me what life would be like without it.  I don&#039;t know what I would do if it was ever pulled from the market.""",9
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m one of those unlucky people that doesn&#039;t really respond to antidepressants, so I need an antipsychotic to stabilize my mood.  I was on Seroquel for a many years but switched after the negative effects of my memory and concentration, which ended up being not so subtle; weight gain and oversleeping came a little while after as well, so I found it was time to switch. This is my best try so far after Seroquel, but that&#039;s not saying much.  Having to take this with food   needing to go to sleep pretty much Right After or else getting lost in a paranoid/anxious frenzy/limbo-type state is really quite challenging. I also get tired pretty early which I believe is due to the half-life of the medication (18 hours or so)""",6
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m a 22 year old female who has struggled with acne since I was 11. I have been on doxycycline (100 mg/day) for the past few years but have struggled with taking it as prescribed (daily) because of the severity of the nausea/vomiting that would cause me to miss school. I talked to my dermatologist and she prescribed me a coated tablet, which was significantly easier to digest. Down side: the coated tablet was much more expensive, even with good insurance. With the coated tablet, I notice no negative side-effects. This medication works fast. As soon as I would begin taking it for 5-7 days straight, I would notice a difference in my face, fewer new breakouts. As soon as I stopped, however, the breakouts would begin to slowly appear again.""",4
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I was prescribed Tenuate extended-release tabs because of my caffeine sensitivity.  Of course, I noticed a change but not the jittery/shaky feeling that comes with harsh stimulants.  My side effects included nausea, constipation, blurred vision (which I didn&#039;t associate to the meds). I lost 15 pounds over a three month period including the winter holiday period but noticed after that I was not losing anymore.  Two months later and a 6 lb weight gain, I&#039;ve decided to stop taking the meds.  Immediately, I noticed extreme exhaustion and an inability to get going.""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I just started Saxenda and have only taken 4 of the .06 doses. I have already lost 5 pounds. I am about 5&#039;3&quot; and started right at 200lbs. Now 195lbs. Seems promising, so far. Not really any side effects. I&#039;ve had a little bit of stomach pain, but it was brief. No nausea or vomiting. My doc did say that the weight usually melts off of people, so we will see!
I took phentermine a few times. The first time I lost 15 lbs in a month, but it made my heart rate faster and it gave me very bad anxiety. I&#039;m glad there&#039;s another option that doesn&#039;t have the bad side effects. 

I do know that the cost is astronomical for Saxenda, so my doc is giving me samples for now. My private insurance doesn&#039;t cover it at all.""",2
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been taking methylphenidate (Ritalin) for years. I started during my professional career, because according to my psych, I am &quot;too smart to sit still&quot;, and that because of that, my brain gets bored easily then my attention span fades. With Ritalin I can focus like a laser on tasks, get much more done, stay organized, and it also helps with that afternoon sleepiness. Added bonus is it revs up your basal metabolic rate, and reduces appetite so you can lose weight easily.
Downside, it increases BP. If you have high BP you may want to avoid it.
I take a 20 mg pill 3-4 times a day, never after dinner if you want to sleep.""",1
Lidoderm,Pain,"""For Pain: &quot;While I&#039;ve gotten very helpful joint pain relief from other brands (WATSON), the MYLAN brand patches are the WORST, MOST INEFFECTIVE, waste of time and money. The backing is thin but stiff pinching the skin making it very uncomfortable and unsuitable. And then they won&#039;t stick. The web site, but not the box, says to press on the patch for better stick, but then pretty much admits you will need tape around the edges which leaves the middle where the meds are still not sticking.  I only am out a small copay but my insurer spent over $200 a box on this garbage. Don&#039;t waste your time to call or write Mylan about their inferior product they will do nothing about it except  &quot;apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced&quot;.""",9
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I was given 15 mg caplets and told to cut them in half.. 7.5 mg the 1st night. Slept well but a little groggy the next day. Didn&#039;t get much accomplished. 2nd night same dose and the next day was a total loss. Just sat in my chair all day. No energy or drive. Then I tried to further the dose by cutting 15 mg into 7.5 mg into 3.75 mg. That&#039;s next to impossible due to the shape of the half tab. One night you get decent dose and the next you get the smaller quarter and it doesn&#039;t work. Too bad hey don&#039;t come in 10 mg tabs.  For me, a big guy, with lots of body mass 3.5 mg would be a good dose but it&#039;s impossible to get with any accuracy.""",0
Buprenorphine,Pain,"""To be fair to the Butrans patch, I didn&#039;t give it a long trial run.  I had to take it off in less than 24 hours because the side effects were so severe.  Previously I had taken Percocet as needed, but because of the good reviews, I decided to try the Butrans patch.  It was a really bad idea.  The patch put me into a terrible withdrawal from Percocet only hours after applying it.  I had severe akathisia (restless body), stomach pain, diarrhea, and I even started seeing things &amp; hearing conversations in my head.  It also made my pupils huge, so anyone who saw me must&#039;ve known that I was high.  It was so embarrassing!  I couldn&#039;t get that patch off fast enough.  I&#039;d rather live with the pain from my spinal fusions, than ever try Butrans again.""",9
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I have had the Mirena for a little over 2 years. At first it was a real pain! It hurt so bad to have placed and I had a heavy period for almost 2 months straight. But then the bleeding stopped completely. Overall, I really like having it. It has helped me have fewer migraines, it is so great to not have a period and love not having to worry about getting pregnant. However, I do have bloating, painful cramping every few weeks, and I&#039;ve just started having some back pain which I think may be connected. Right now I can tolerate the side effects for the benefits it gives. I have thought about getting it taken out, but I really don&#039;t want to go back to horrible migraines or any other form of birth control.""",8
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been taking this for 3 months. I lost 30lbs in the first 2 months, and have maintained for the past month. This past month I&#039;ve been eating horribly just b/c I&#039;ve been distracted by other personal problems. But I haven&#039;t gained a single pound back, mainly because this stuff will not let you overeat. I have next to no appetite, so even when I do eat junk, I can only eat maybe 1/3 of it. I&#039;ve had to REMIND myself to eat a few times, that&#039;s how much this has killed my appetite. First month was rough with side effects; lots of vomiting immediately after eating, fatigue, etc. But the weight practically fell off against my will.  It&#039;s a life changer!""",3
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I experienced insomnia due to the stress of repeated night wakings from my baby coinciding with my husband leaving for a week at a time for work. I began with 7.5mg and it worked like a charm from the beginning. Some drowsiness in the morning but nothing a cup of coffee wouldn&#039;t cure. I gained 7 lbs but I am keeping track of calories now and that is almost off again. Could not say for certain if it was a result of this medicine because that happens if I am not paying attention anyway. Baby still wakes at night at times but I can go right back to sleep on this. I would recommend it to anyone with sleep issues.""",0
Concerta,ADHD,"""Iv&#039;e been on comcerta 2 weeks now n just gone up to 36mg I&#039;ve had ADHD all my life and only just been diagnosed, always wondered why I can be anything I want end up going off the rails! Anyways this medication has basically changed me in a good way, I think if u really have ADHD this medication works n only doesn&#039;t work when u haven&#039;t got it! First week struggled sleeping but fine now, n theres no loss on my appetite I just don&#039;t crave the sugar n junk food that I used to so its a win win for me coz I&#039;m a boxer and been in sport all my life! I can focus proper n its basically a miracle, for me, so far like :)""",1
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve struggled with anxiety for years and worried about everything!  I finally tried escitalopram!  One of the best things I ever did!  I was so scared of living in a fog from past experiences with anxiety meds.!   In the first week I found 10mg to be to much, so I started cutting down to 2 mg!  When I was ready or felt anxiety sneaking on me again I would up it another 2 mg!  Yes all the side affects are real and possible!  But after 4 to 5 weeks I was able to level out!  I gave it my best shot and it was worth it in the end!  I&#039;m now taking 10mg daily!  hope this was helpful""",7
Duloxetine,Depression,"""Cymbalta was my first attempt at antidepressants. It was prescribed for both anxiety and extreme depression. Before Cymbalta I was literally non-functioning. After a week of taking it, with Zero side effects, I felt like a different person. A better person. I did have my occasional bad day, but nothing like before. I am no longer on Cymbalta because my insurance dropped it. I moved from it to Pristiq with virtually no withdrawals. I would take it again in a heartbeat.""",5
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I have been using Saxenda for a month now as started Nov 4, 2017. My starting weight was 242 pounds and I&#039;m 5&#039;10 male. Today as of Dec 4, 2017 I weigh 230 so a -12 weight loss in a month. Definite reduction in appetite as feel full with about half or less than of what would normally eat before. Exercising lightly, mostly walking but getting a treadmill and free weights to soon to start to increase intensity of exercise as now at full 3mg dosage. No real side effects only at start was feeling tired but went away after first week. Will update every month as goal is to get to 170 pounds.""",2
OxyContin,Pain,"""My husband has been prescribed some kind of pain killer since the age of 11 due to football injuries as well as several auto accidents. Seventy-two broken bones throughout his life. About 9 years ago a pain management doctor prescribed him Oxycontin, and it has changed his life for the good as well as creating some unfortunate disadvantages. The withdrawl is horrible for him, but after a bilateral knee replacement, it definitely improved the quality of both of our lives. He is much more active than before, and can do so many things that I had to do for him in the past. So with proper management by doctors it has definitely proved to be a God-send.""",9
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have been taking Nucynta for about 1 1/2 years now for Fibromyalgia pain in my back. I started on the low dose of 50mg and that worked for a while but had to move up to 75mg. I think I may have to move up to the next mg dose again but that does not mean that the medication is not working. Over the years, my fibromyalgia has slowly gotten worse and I was not on any pain medicines for it because I did not know what was wrong with me. The only side effect I have experienced (besides the drowsiness for the first 2 weeks of taking the medicine) is being itchy. This is a medication that needs to be given the chance of at least 6 weeks before you decide that it isn&#039;t working.""",9
Concerta,ADHD,"""Ive had a history abusing Adderall here and there due to my addictive nature so being prescribed this medicine raised concerns between my family and doctor. Because of my horrible ADHD we decided to give it a chance and its nothing compared to the &#039;kick in the nuts&#039; Adderall is known for. My grades have improved in school, my mood is slightly elevated and my cavings for sugar have ceased. It has not affected my sleep and so far works great. This is my experience and everyone reacts differently. I highly suggest this medication for anyone like me who has ADHD and possible addiction issues. Its rate of abuse is very slim because it seems to &#039;ceiling&#039; like Suboxone for opiate addicts. Lets go build some robots!""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on Contrave for 7 weeks and have lost 10 lbs with no change in exercise.  It has suppressed my appetite.  I have had no side effects other than a bit of an upset stomach for an hour on 2 different days, which went away after I drank some water.  I am very happy with it.  I wish I had started taking it a long time ago. It is worth the money.  Now I just need to ramp up my exercise so I will drop the weight more quickly. I highly recommend this product.""",2
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I first took Lexapro some 4-5 yrs ago for anxiety. I don&#039;t think I was depressed just had a lot of anxiety through stress and if I drank, and I&#039;m not talking a lot, a few beers, I would wake up all edgy, not hungover, pure anxiety, but I was feeling like that quite often.  It definitely worked right away and the anxiety ceased.  I eventually stopped taking it because I felt I didn&#039;t need it anymore.  4-5 years later, I was going through some serious depression.  My wife at the time suggested perhaps I go back on; this was definitely depression, much more than anxiety.  Anyway, it was disastrous!  The minute I started taking it, the depression got worse!  The Dr. told me to try to get through it for a week or two and I just couldn&#039;t.""",7
Citalopram,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for about a month now. It helped me a little at first, now I&#039;m having crying spells and feeling hopeless again.  The glass is always half empty. I&#039;m taking 20 mg.  I was hoping Celexa would work.  I had been taking Paxil 20mg for about three years and I was so happy on it! It didn&#039;t matter what was going on in my life. I felt great.  I stopped taking Paxil because it made me sleepy all the time.  I guess I&#039;ll continue for a few more weeks with Celexa.  If things don&#039;t get better I&#039;m going back to Paxil.""",5
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""Doxepin is the fourth medication that I have been prescribed for my insomnia. Prior to Doxepin, I had taken melatonin (as many insomniacs begin with), Trazodone, and Seroquel. I do not remember any noteworthy effects from the first two, but I was amazed with Seroquel. It worked like a charm once I fell asleep. However, it often took me far too long to fall asleep and I felt extremely groggy, sometimes for hours, when I woke up. Still, I was very satisfied, having finally found something that brought me some much needed rest. When I switched doctor&#039;s, though, I was switched to Doxepin. I have only taken it for a short time, but I cannot praise it highly enough. It takes effect far more quickly and has less grogginess than Seroquel (for me).""",0
Belviq,Obesity,"""I have taken Belviq for two weeks only lost 2 pounds. belviq has no effect on me I cut grass to help make extra money on the side. That&#039;s the only time I see any weight lost. I was doing that before belviq this medicine has slow me down makes me tired. I execise less with belviq. I cant believe they want 200 hundred dollars for these pill not worth it. all diets if you exercise and eat right work with out the pills. Belviq don&#039;t even curb my appetite. Very disappointing. the chest and body pain are scary.""",2
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""Due to family illnesses, family addictions and marital problems I had been having severe anxiety and panic attacks that seemed to be getting worse and I was having difficulty sleeping at night. I was prescribed 50mg Hydroxyzine up to 3 times a day as needed for anxiety. After about 10 mins of taking my first dose it was as if someone snapped there fingers and the weight of the world was finally lifted off my chest and I could breath. This really helped melt away my anxiety. I didn&#039;t feel numb or drugged but I felt relaxed. It was like a heavy, and grounded feeling. I did sleep a lot the first two days I took it but I feel like that was due to my body finally getting to catch up on some much needed rest. I feel like in have my life back :-)""",7
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I have been on Saxenda for just over 3 weeks and I have lost roughly 13lbs. I had some nausea with the first 2 doses but have been fine since. Only downside I will say is constipation. My &quot;normal&quot; cycle was never normal persay but it&#039;s been so much worse on this medication. It won&#039;t stop me from taking the medication though. I just have to figure out a way to get it under control. I have absolutely no appetite which is good and bad. Good because I won&#039;t overeat but bad because I don&#039;t eat and when I try to eat anything I feel nauseous. Either way though, I&#039;m happy with the medication.""",2
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Vyvanse has been wonderful for me. I take it along with the anti-depressant Lexapro and the two medications work wonderfully together. I am a full time college student. I have been taking Vyvanse for about 8 months and I don&#039;t know what I would do without it now. I am focused and my mind is not racing a million miles an hour. I did about a year of school without it and I was an A, B, C student, but now I am mostly making A&#039;s with the occasional B.""",1
Tramadol,Depression,"""I have lost 5 pounds on this drug Tramadol.  I was on a weight loss journey and had lost 65 pounds on my own but as of recently, I have struggled with the last 40 until I started taking the Tramadol.  It will suppress your appetite and help with food cravings. I believe this drug is a great aid for losing weight if one uses it appropriately. This drug was not prescribed for depression nor weight loss but it is killing two birds with one stone in my life.""",5
Kariva,Birth Control,"""I have been on Kariva for less than 2 years, and I guess I never read the drug information because my sex drive is near nothing. I even get annoyed when sex is brought up. My period is only 3 days long though, and no nausea or cramping to go with. But, the fact that my body refuses sex now is getting ridiculous. My doctor suggested it for me because I am pretty moody or my moods flipped a lot on everything else I tried. But Kariva was the last thing I could try. I&#039;m breaking up with it. I miss being intimate with my boyfriend...""",8
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve dealt with severe panic disorder my whole life, if i feel on the edge i will take the hydroxzine and it will take my anxiety down and help me rest. The down side is if i go into a severe panic attack it does nothing for me. I had to go to court so i took six 50mg (every 2 hours) it had no effect because i hate standing in front of people, i was still panicking. Where i live (and probably most places now) people take advantage of benzodiazepine and other drugs so no doctor will prescribe them to me. I am the exact person that needs them and i will not take advantage. I have never tried xanax because I don&#039;t take anything that&#039;s not prescribed to me, but I&#039;m curious to see if it would work because I&#039;m desperate.""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I am a nineteen year old female who has suffered with mild acne since I was about 10. I tried every cream, pill, and face wash you can imagine throughout the years and nothing completely got rid of my acne. When I was 18 my doctor recommended I try Accutane. I did a 6 month course of 10 mg a day and I can honestly say it changed my life. I would recommend to anyone who struggles with persistent acne. Before taking Accutane acne controlled my life. I would stay home just because of bad breakouts. Now my skin is flawless and I only get the occasional pimple which I can now deal with. Yes, I was dry when I was on Accutane but the end result is SO worth the 6 months of mild dryness!""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am now on my 3rd month of Adipex. I started June at 190 and currently at 166.4lb I still get the dry mouth and had two episodes of getting blurred vision, clammy feeling and passing out and than throw up. Well today I figured out the common factor of each time that happened. I had one alcoholic beverage each of those days. So lesson learned even 1 little drink with this medication can cause major side effects. Other than that I have been totally fine. So I chalked it up to human error!!! Hoping to keep the weight off when my 3 months are up. Well check back on my last day for final results of 3 months.""",3
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""Valium has saved my life. I suffered from &quot;neck tightness&quot; that almost drove me to the point of insanity, which no doctor could diagnosis or understand. I thought there was no solution and had lost all hope. It turned out to be a psychological thing (anxiety disorder) but the Valium immediately alleviated my symptoms. I take the Valium when I feel my anxiety symptoms flare up. These days I don&#039;t need to take it that often, knowing its just anxiety""",7
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""First of all, let me start by saying that I hear that this is an expensive drug because of how new it is. Luckily for me (perhaps, lol), my insurance considera me catastrophic due to my checkered past, and pays the entire price because they want me to take this medication and stfu lol. Since taking Seroquel XR, my life has improved so much, and I really have never felt more stable in my life. I&#039;ve tried anticonvulsants and other antipsychotics and they have not worked for me. This medication really does, to my surprise! The only downfall is that I&#039;ve gained 10 pounds taking it, but any antipsychotic will do that. Strongly recommend Seroquel XR!""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hi!  When my Dr put me on this I was upset with my weight I have a lot of health problems the number 1# of them is rheumatoid arthritis I have had it for little over 13 year&#039;s and I&#039;m just 36 it has took over my life I can&#039;t get out and do much so for over the past five years I have picked up A LOT of weight and it has drove me insane June 5th 2018 at 277lb I get the pill one a day go back July 5th at 264lb gives me for this month 2 a day so August 4th at 246lb down 31 pound&#039;s Love it no problem with it Other then DRY mouth I&#039;m still on it 2 a day""",3
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""I am BEYOND angry at how terrible my skin broke out while using this medication. It was a mystery to myself and family when my face began to break out terribly, to the point where I was prescribed oral acne medication and the painful cysts still didn&#039;t go away. This medication almost ruined my skin, I am so thankful I stopped when I did and read these reviews! It&#039;s honestly infuriating that this was the cause! I stopped taking this pill about a week ago and my skin has already cleared up substantially. Do not recommend!!!!""",4
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I have to say this medicine was a lifesaver for me, and I do not use the term lightly.  Before I took these tablets I had got to the point where I thought NOTHING could help me and every sleepless night was a living hell.  These tablets finally allowed me to sleep but also had a true restorative effect on my depleted brain which carried over to the next day.  I know there are side effects, especially on a higher dose, but these side effects were worth it for the benefits they gave me.  I know it&#039;s hard but amitriptyline can give you a crutch to lean on and please don&#039;t dismiss them.  If they can help me, and I was really at the end of the line, they can help somebody else.""",0
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""After having to pay a but load out of pocket for this i slowly found out it was not for me. It put me in a hyper-manic state. Had to constantly be moving. Would wake up every morning at 7 am, when the sunlight started peaking in my room, regardless of what time I was finally able to pass out. And worst of all, it caused me to have problems using the restroom. No matter how hard I tried or what I did it made me not able to urinate. Some meds don&#039;t work on some people as they should.""",6
Dapsone,Acne,"""I began experiencing acne when I turned 35. Of course I thought this was odd due to being midway to 40, so I dealt with it long as I could. I tried Proactive, it work for a while, Neutrogena, nothing was happening. It was almost like my face took turns into which side would break out first. I  was always self conscious and began wearing make up to master the acne and the dark spots. Finally I became frustrated and decided to see a dermatologist for my never ending battle with my face. The Dermatologist recommended I try Doryx and Aczone. At first I did not see any change but it has now been almost three weeks and I notice a difference. Waiting for better results.""",4
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I just started Contrave 5 days ago.  The positives are that I&#039;ve noticed my appetite is suppressed and I&#039;m eating smaller portions. Also sleeping great, but I am only on the 1x a day dose in the morning.  The negative side is the nausea and stomach ache later in the day. I wouldn&#039;t consider them enough to stop at this point and I plan to continue on with it at this point. Hoping these negative side effects will subside as my body gets used to it.""",3
Skyla,Birth Control,"""Only posting to provide a positive experience with skyla. I&#039;m 24 and had skyla inserted about 8 months ago. Insertion was definitely uncomfortable/painful (I was NOT on my period and they say that helps) but it was very quick and you&#039;ll get through it. I drove myself home and had the WORST cramps I&#039;ve ever experienced just for a day or so. Heating pads and midol were my best friends. I spotted a little bit right after it was inserted and that was it! No more spotting, and then 2 weeks later I got my period like normal. I NEVER went through the weeks and months of spotting like some other girls did. My period has been like clockwork the past 8 months, and are light and last about 4 days, with little to no cramping at all. never been happier!""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Im in my 30 5&#039;6 and my starting weight was 276. In the first month I lost 24 pounds. The second month I lost 8 more. I stopped because I felt like my body was getting accustomed to it. So one month later I went to the doctor to get more pills. I started taking a week ago and I lost 10 more pounds. From the beginning I watch what I ate. I drank water and when I was tired of drinking water I would drink a small bottle of powerade to get some flavor. The doctor told me to be on a 1200 calorie diet but I choose 500 to help the process. I was a size 22 and now I&#039;m between 16 and 18 depending on the clothing. So I lost a total of 45 pounds being actively on the pill for 2 months 1 week. Im happy...can&#039;t complain.""",3
Kariva,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had a pretty good experience with this birth control. I didn&#039;t experience any mood swings or weight gain. I actually lost a bit of weight the two times I switched to Kariva from a different birth control. Overall I felt better on this birth control than any other that I have taken. The big issue that I had is that after taking it for a couple of months I would get breakthrough bleeding in the middle of the month. The bleeding would last so long that it pretty much a second period. It was a bit frustrating being on your period for half of the month. It might have decreased my sex-drive a bit too.""",8
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""This medicine definitely worked for me.  It takes hours for me to fall asleep and i usually wake up pretty much every hour.  I did fall asleep fast and it pretty much kept me asleep.  I did wake up 2 or 3 times during the night, but fell right back to sleep.  After 9 hours of sleep I could barely open my eyes, they were very bloodshot and I was super sensitive to light.  Additionally, I was stumbling around a little.  When I woke up at night i felt a little disoriented too.  I went back to sleep for another hour and felt a little better.  It took hours for the grogginess to wear off.  I only took 50mg.  I think i may try 10mg and see how that works.  I would recommend trying it when you have the next day off, just to test for side effects""",0
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""It has been a life saver for me and my insomnia.  I&#039;ve tried other medications before like Ambien but with my anxiety, it was not effective in helping me fall asleep.  I&#039;ve been using Trazodone for years now without any complications.  For me, it works instantly or up to the most 10 minutes, depending on my dosage.  In the days that I don&#039;t have because I&#039;m waiting on my refill, I never get to sleep when I want/need to.""",0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 18, only had sex once and never been pregnant. I got this iud earlier today. They had me take cytotec (inserted vaginally last night) to help dilate the cervix which I think helped a lot, since when iIwent in today it almost didn&#039;t hurt at all! I also took 3 advil about an hour before the procedure. It only took a few minutes for the doctor to clean, measure and insert the iud. at worst it felt like minor menstrual cramps. Since then it&#039;s been a little achey, but again very mild; I&#039;ve had cramps much worse than this. had some spotting since the appointment, but that could also be the start of my period. overall it was such a relief how quick and painless it was, after having read scary reviews the night before. really glad I chose skyla""",8
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been battling insomnia for almost 5 years, mostly sleep maintenance.  I&#039;ve tried every medication under the sun.  Belsomra is the new kid on the block and works very differently than all other &quot;sleep&quot; drugs (via orexin/hypocretin receptor antagonism).  I&#039;ve been following and waiting for this drug&#039;s release for years.  First night at 20mgs, I slept 8 hours without waking once, something I haven&#039;t done in years, but boy, does it  sure cause next day sedation.  Well, tiredness is a better term.  Doesn&#039;t cause a &quot;hangover&quot; effects like other drugs, just a tired feeling is the best way to describe it.  Will try 10 or 15mgs and see if the next day tiredness lessens.""",0
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have been on Nucynta for 2 years following a ten - twelve foot fall. Nucynta is without a doubt the best pain medication I have ever been prescribed. It works well  on my severe shoulder, back, and neck pain. Without the nasty side effects of other opiates I was taking such as Hydrocodone. I am able to stay alert and I have not built up a tolerance to it. Nucynta has been a game changer for me. . .""",9
Vicodin,Pain,"""I was prescribed Vicodin as a rescue med for migraine. I&#039;ve only used it 3 times but have had to cease using it because it makes me itchy all over my body. I don&#039;t get a rash, just very itch, it drives me nuts. 
I was taking 2 x 10/325 tablets (after taking 4 mg Zofran). It doesn&#039;t completely take away my migraine. I can still function. I need a little nap, then I can get up and work, drive car etc. It did wonders for my neck and back pain I am currently getting physio on, but it hasn&#039;t been a wonder rescue drug for migraine. I&#039;ve been given a different narcotic rescue med to try. Hopefully I won&#039;t need to use it. I am on Depakote as a preventative and use Cambia as an abortive. These both work well, especially if I take the Cambia early.""",9
Ritalin,ADHD,"""My 7 year old son has shown ADHD symptoms for about 2 years or so but due to many changes in his life, I was unsure of the reason for this behavior. Now we&#039;ve been settled in for &gt;9 months and he has not improved, we have decided to medicate (after dietary changes and omega 3 gave no help). He has been taking Ritalin 10mg for 12 days now. The 1st week he had only morning dose at 8am. This wore off around 1pm. This week I&#039;ve dosed him 4 hours later also. From 1st day the change was amazing. He was attentive and followed instruction throughout his swim lesson and his school teacher found great improvement in attention span, concentration and finishing tasks. He is not as angry or frustrated now. The only negative is that I find he gets emotional and &#039;teary&#039; as it wears off.""",1
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""Absolutely saved my life. After having severe facial pain for 3 months and not one doctor could diagnose me... I started have bad anxiety and depression. I was always that person that was so against anti depressants and anxiety medicine. My family kept telling me I needed to do something so I finally decided to take Lexapro! I have been on it for a little over 2 months and it was the best decision I&#039;ve made. It has made me mentally relax and when any issues arise I&#039;m able to think about it calmly and rationally, when before I would panic over everything. The first week the side effects were pretty bad, so make sure you take an anxiety medication with it.               (For 2 weeks -1 month) until the side effects disappear. Highly recommend""",7
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""Diagnosed 6 years ago as Bipolar 2 after 20 years of being all over the place. crazy ups/back downs but only ever treated for depression, I was put on a variety of medications in the first year that made me so ill, weight gains/losses, irrational thoughts/ideas, constantly felt ill with colds/flu had to keep changing medications and doses to see if they would work, then given Depakote, wow I felt human again within 2 weeks, settled, calm, clear head no side effects, its done wonders for me that no other got close to, I have my life back""",6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve gone the rounds with sleeping pills since I suffer from a CNS disorder. Belsomra is different from the others I&#039;ve tried in that, at least for me, it isn&#039;t incapacitating, meaning I get no &quot;high&quot; from it. At 20mg, the largest dose, it doesn&#039;t feel anything like Ambien did, where I was seeing things that weren&#039;t there. In a way, this was a little disappointing as I like that tired/druggy feeling to ease me to sleep, but what Belsomra actually did was send me off to sleep without me knowing about it, which is how I remember falling asleep as a kid. One minute you&#039;re laying there thinking, then the next you wake up and the clock has passed several hours. That&#039;s good enough for me.""",0
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Been on it for over a year. I take 0-100 mg a night as needed, but typically it&#039;s 100. After the first two weeks I&#039;ve had few side effects (at first there was dry mouth, headaches, as my body adjusted to it). Once I take it I have to keep myself occupied for an hour or two, not yet trying to sleep, but still relaxing, watching T.V, reading, etc., until the medicine takes effect. When that happens, it&#039;s very clear. I can pretty much shut my eyes and fall asleep within minutes. The only downside is that my already detailed and abundant nightmares are very much heightened and are often disturbing, which makes me wake up feeling disturbed but not drowsy. Would recommend.""",0
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I had previously been put on every kind of antidepressant for depresion/anxiety. They all worked horribly; so I stopped all drugs and ceased seeing doctors. 
Then, I felt insanely suicidal- I was absolutely crazed. Luckily my sister urged me to seek help as fast as I could- so I did. I went to see another psychiatrist, and he diagnosed me as bipolar. I started on Lamictal, but that didn&#039;t do anything for me. Then I switched to Lithium- THANK GOODNESS I still get depressed, but I never get sucked into a deep suicidal hole like before. I quit the drug for 1 month, which caused me to think about suicide unrelentlessly. Never again will I stop taking Lithium. (Does cause extreme thirst and hand tremors, but well worth it)""",6
Ritalin,ADHD,"""My son was diagnosed with ADHD last week he has always been super hyper, climbs on furniture, spins, sticks tongue out and can&#039;t look anyone in the eyes without fidgeting around. I didn&#039;t want to believe it but when my parents and my grandparents, also the dentist asked about him...I knew things were getting worse. He was seen by 3 specialists in NH and was given 5mg of Ritalin 1/2 morning 1/2 afternoon, he has already had a profound change in his behavior. He doesn&#039;t stick his tongue out of his mouth at all and makes crazy noises, he can sit calmly now and concentrate, he actually played with some of his toy which he didn&#039;t really do before, only con so far..after 4 hours he has aggressive behavior and crying over nothing. Just started maybe that&#039;s why.""",1
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I have been using Implanon for over a year now and I really like it. I only got my period the first month when my body was getting used to it and have not had it since. I have gained about 8 pounds in the last year but I&#039;m not sure if it was from the Implanon. Either way it is not bad.  I like Implanon because I don&#039;t have to think about taking it. I used to have the NuvaRing and would even forget the dates for that so it is nice to have a birth control that I can&#039;t forget to take.""",8
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I tried it for one night it made me feel drugged- relaxed but drugged but unable to sleep. The next day I felt off all day, complete body soreness. I was a complete grump. I was on a short fuse that day. I felt drugged the whole day, I have been take Ambien CR for about four years now and it is the only sleep medication that works for me. Mirtazapine I had a really bad reaction it isn&#039;t for me.""",0
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am 60 years old and a career woman who has always struggled with completing tasks despite working long hours. Had recently succombed to depression and loss of self esteem because I was feeling I was no longer capable of performing my job because of age. Suffered this feeling most of my life,  been in therapy and was usually prescribed antidepressants or SSRI inhibitors to treat my symptoms but never cause of my symptoms. I did not even know adults could suffer from ADD. FINALLY a therapist took the time to treat the cause of my lifelong struggle instead of merely sedating me.  MY LIFE HAS CHANGED!! MY JOB PERFORMANCE AND PERSONAL LIFE HAS IMPROVED. I ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THINGS.  Why so late in life?""",1
Focalin XR,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD when i was about 5 and my experience over all has been amazing ive been on it for 12 years now i take 40mg once in the morning and in the afternoon and by like 6pm it wears off(btw im 6 feet tall and weigh 225 lb thanks to this medication).  The only bad parts or symptoms im having are that Caffeine has no effect on me anymore( probably built up a tolerance thanks to the focalin) , I dont always sleep to well, and ever since i tuned like 14 my appetite went from non-existent to out of control (dont know why...) im 17 now and am an A- Student where as i was an F student before, I definitely recommend this but i should warn you all its not for everyone there are alternatives.""",1
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Started this birth control because I became sexually active and having bleeding irregularities. My gyno really pushed this for me because she says teens forget the pill and this is better for long term use since I am so young and don&#039;t want a kid any time soon. I agreed and understood that the first months would be very weird. I got it implanted April 2016. No symptoms for about two weeks, I have been bleeding now for 3 months. Less than a period (my periods were light and regular) but enough to wear panty liner everyday. I have lost 15 pounds and no mood swings, depression or increase in acne. Still in the beginning of process and am please but if bleeding does not stop within another month I am going back to see if the bleeding can stop.""",8
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve started taking Concerta because of ADD when I was 21. I went to see my doctor, I was explaining to him that I had difficulty keeping up at school since I was a kid, but the only reason I&#039;m in University was because I was in art school. He prescribed me concerta. If anyone took speed before, it&#039;s exactly the same effect. You do get a down. You are more focused. You loose weight. However, you can go to sleep at night. The problem is, I don&#039;t take it everyday, I think it&#039;s a little bit too harsh for me. I&#039;ll go see him again, maybe I have psychological issues.
It DID help with my sleeping: I always fell asleep in the afternoon, it took everything I had to stay awake ( at school, at home, at friends house) I was known as the sleeper.""",1
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Bad drug I wonder If all the good reviews  on the internet was written by the Company behind it ...first i took 5mg X2  The morning dose made me sleepy at the point that I can&#039;t stay awake for 5 minutes...Now I take 10mg at night It makes me sleep for 12 hours (Can&#039;t wake up) &amp; gave me Flat affect- totally impaired Thinking- Loss Of hope in life - Suicidal thoughts -Problems in tongue &amp; Talking ( bec. Its sublingual) ...Horrible Drug &amp; Don&#039;t Believe All the good reviews you read !""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Phentermine works great for weight loss. I&#039;ve taken it two different times. I lost 30 pounds in 2 months the first time. The second time I lost 10 pounds in a week but had to discontinue use due to side effects. I had postpartum depression the second time and it made my depression much, much, much worse, and I had horrible &quot;phen rage&quot;. I would definitely suggest talking to your Dr if you struggle with depression before starting Phentermine.""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Hi , I&#039;m 40. 5-11 290 male when starting phentermine 37.5 mg. I figured I better post and help someone maybe not go through what I went through the 1st three days . Take on full stomach !!!!! I took this med on semi empty stomach the first 2 days and I thought I was going to come out of my skin it was horrible horrible feeling like I never felt !!!  I stopped my dose after day 2 and didn&#039;t wear off for another full day and slept 1hr in those 3 days !!!!! So day 4 I tried on a full stomach and no probs just the normal bad cotton mouth . I work swing shifts so I learned if your going to take this med take it as if it&#039;s not going to wear off for 16hrs. If you do this you&#039;ll be able to sleep if not good luck lol. lost 18 pounds this month""",2
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I tried a lot of the SSRIs and SNRIs medicines, Lexapro, Effexor, Celexa, Wellbutrin, pristiq, Paxil. Lexapro and Effexor gave me monster insomnia, could not sleep for nothing. Wellbutrin made me pass out and the other 2 did nothing for me. Finally my Doctor put me on Buspar 7.5 two times a day. It did make me nauseated but it says to take it on a full stomach which I took on an empty stomach. After I followed the directions I didn&#039;t have any more issues. No side effects and my libido has increased (wife happy). Really no more issues with anxiety anymore, I can now go to dinner, the grocery store without any issues.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I am approaching 3 years on Nexplanon and do not regret it at all; I will certainly get a 2nd one. They only side effect I experience is irregular bleeding, however it is almost always very light. I personally manage this with washable, reusable cloth pantie liners. The benefits of high efficacy, low drug interactions, and little active management far outweigh the minimal side effects I experience.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I took this drug for a little over a month and only lost 6 lbs.   I am menopausal and am taking medication to suppress my auto immune disease which cause me not to be able to loose weight and due to my disease be able to exercise.  

This drug WAS NOT covered by my insurance but got the savings card to cut the costs down.  After a month of extreme constipation (even with taking laxatives), severe headaches and overall not feeling good I decided to quit taking this drug.

It is NOT a cure all for weight loss.   I do not eat that much so suppression of my appetite did not work, nor did it make me crave healthy foods like some have reported.   I was afraid to go to the maximum dosing of 2 and 2 but did it anyway.""",2
Percocet,Pain,"""I have herniated discs in my lower back from a fall. I generally don&#039;t like taking narcotic pain killers, but it gets to a certain point where I would take anything to make the pain stop. That&#039;s when I take one  5/325 Percocet. It takes 90% of my pain away when I take it with Motrin. I&#039;ve tried every non narcotic pain reliever and had no results. I tried Ultram with high hopes but it didn&#039;t help. It&#039;s a shame that because of abuse this medication is so frowned upon (and hard to get even if you really need it). It&#039;s so helpful for me and gets me through days that I would otherwise spend crying or in bed. The only downside is if I have to take it a couple days in a row I get constipated. I have no dizziness, high feeling or nausea.""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I have moderate acne and its really annoying to be honest. I tried everything from over the counter medicines like Clearasil scrub and wipes, Oxyface wash, tea tree oil, clean and clear and none of improved and to be honest it made it worse. So then I went to the doctor and he prescribed me Duac, Zineryt, tetracycline and Differin. The Duac I was prescribed with 2 years ago and it cleared my acne up for about 20 months but then they come back again, so I went to the dermatologist he prescribed me Accutane 30mgs and 20mgs prednisone after 1 month there were little improvement but then it got really bad. I&#039;m currently on months 3 and its still bad. I&#039;ve had my dose moved up to 60mgs. I hope it works I finish my course next month.""",4
Toradol,Pain,"""I have been in total agony with a pain that felt like I was going to be giving birth to an elephant, plus pains in each side of the abdomen and pain coming out in my lower back and rib pain. The pain made my moods and emotions full of anger, sobbing, outbursts, I felt non-human. Just no control of myself. I tried Dilaudid, and Tylenol 3&#039;s nothing worked and while in emergency I was treated with several drugs, the pain remained. Finally Dilaudid with a shot of Toradol and it took the pain, what a relief. I felt human again, I felt focused and I could see life and what was real. """,9
Mirena,Birth Control,"""So far I&#039;ve had a decent experience with mirena. I had it inserted during my period (on the 2ND day) that was a weird experience. Insertion was a breeze, no discomfort. I was nervous after reading all of the reviews.  Less than 1 minute  and it was over. I threw on my clothes and i countined on with my day like normal. I&#039;m sure i should&#039;ve waited to habe sex but i didnt. On the 3rd day i had some cramping, since then no cramping. Ive never really had much crampong so i went into a little bit of a panic mode And was beginning to doubt my decision. Bybthe next day the cramping was gone. Mild spotting.  I feel like my sex drive has increased.  I am worried about the weight gain but I plan on staying active and keep a close eye on""",8
Effexor,Bipolar Disorde,"""If I was not on Effexor (in combination with Lithium &amp; Seroquel), truthfully, I would not be here to write this.  With investigation by my psychiatrist into  my medical records, we identified I have been bipolar for 40 years.  Many of them I was not treated, even though I spent three different times in a &quot;mental&quot; facility.  The only identification for me was that I was a difficult and troubled person.  When I finally met the psychiatrist I have today, with his help and his innate understanding of what bipolar is, it only took 3 or 4 different prescriptions to finally arrive at Effexor giving me the best overall help.  As I mentioned earlier, this prescription has truly been a life saver.  No bothersome side effects.""",6
Prozac,Depression,"""I took Prozac for about five months 1989-90.  I felt buoyant for the first six weeks, then less so.  After three months or so, my mood was down and my fingers were stiff and painful upon waking.  After four months, both hands and feet were in pain and did not function for an hour after waking.  The condition persisted, in an ever-diminishing form, for five years after discontinuation of the medicine.  I am told that my reaction was rare; nevertheless, it happened to me.""",5
Methadone,Pain,"""I was tried on numerous medications for my chronic pain. When I took my first dose of methadone, I was &quot;nearly&quot; pain free for half the day and the dose doesn&#039;t need to be increased as often as it did on other drugs such as Oxycontin. For break through pain I only need an anti-inflammatory or another mild narcotic such as Percocet, and only rarely.
I think this is a great drug for pain!""",9
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve had serious anxiety since I was a teen. In the last 4 years (thanks to some random health issues) it has skyrocketed and life has become unbearable. Everyday I thought I was having a heart attack - despite stellar cardio results. Anxiety took full control of my life - mentally and physically. Xanax and booze (not together) work like a charm but I fear the addiction potential. My doc put me on low dose of Lexapro (5 mg) and within 48 hours all my crazy anxiety ended. Gone. I feel normal again - it&#039;s been YEARS since I&#039;ve felt this way. Small sexual side effect (long time to ejaculate) and slight weight gain but I&#039;m ok with that. Another side effect: my co-workers &amp; friends like me again.""",7
Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed with  bipolar manic depressive , acute anxiety, depression, ocd , borderline personality, and post traumatic stress syndrome, when I was 21... postpartum depression triggered something, I was constantly agitated and angry, and sad,  .I would wake up angry, and cry allll day...my Dr prescribed me 20 mg zyprexa and I swear to you I was terrified,  that it would take 4 to 6 weeks to really work (I didn&#039;t have 4 to 6 weeks to wait , I felt...) I was nearly over the edge completely, constantly thinking suicide, I took my first dose of zyprexa and the very next morning I woke up wonderful!!! I still get upset , but not like before, this medicine was truly a miracle for me""",6
Dapsone,Acne,"""I have suffered from cystic acne for almost 10 years. I&#039;ve tried every topical known to man and not one, but TWO rounds of Accutane. But it still comes back.

I started using Aczone once a day (at night) with a basic moisturizer and have noticed a phenomenal difference. It hasn&#039;t healed me because when I&#039;m lazy refilling my prescription, my skin breaks out again. But at least I know it&#039;s working when I do use it.

Only downside: it&#039;s expensive! Ask your derm for a coupon!""",4
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""Panic attacks came at 46 when I had negative life experiences we all will get and was prescribed this from a doctor. I never took it,Ii overcame anxiety and I accepted it. I tricked my mind into knowing nothing was going to happen and how did I realize that? Because nothing ever happened and the next day kept coming. When you feel an attack coming say to yourself nothing is going to happen and tomorrow will come and you&#039;ll still be here doing fine for sure as your reading this..good luck..and make sure your eating right and exercising.""",7
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have had a 30lb weight gain since May of last year, so I finally was able to get Saxenda prescribed to me! And I am thrilled! I just finished my 2nd week and I have lost NINE POUNDS in 12 days! This is with NO excercise other than normal walking at work and house cleaning. It has curbed my appetite I have been keeping a daily food journal , I am on dose 1.2 and have a VERY hard time eating more than 800 to 900 calories a day and keeping my carb intake under 90 or less. Of course the low calories are the largest part of the weight loss. I have found that Saxenda has given me the ability to walk right past any snacks , I am excited to be on this  journey! Will give an update on weight next week.""",2
Strattera,ADHD,"""My son was diagnosed with Autism, however he has symptoms of ADHD but is not. The ADHD meds. just made things worse for him so the Dr. gave me Strattera to try 10mg and it helped, I kept wondering why he could take this but not other ADHD meds. his pediatrician told me it is an antidepressant that was discovered to have a calming effect, and if it makes him tired take it at bedtime. It is very expensive but helps we have not been able to increase the dose, but kids on the spectrum are difficult to medicate.""",1
Tapentadol,Pain,"""Excellent alternative to oxycodone/hydrocodone based pain killers. Eliminated the pain very effectively once I got home from my ACL/MCL left knee surgery. I used the 75 mg IR version as needed every 4-6 hours but the pain relief routinely lasted the entire 6 hours. I experienced no nausea or stomach discomfort of any kind. Most importantly to me, while I did feel the usual significant euphoria associated with most prescription narcotics, it was not overwhelming and no dizziness or disorientation accompanied it. This gave me the confidence and therefore the ability to drive safely only three days after my surgery while taking the Tapentadol. Just needed it for 7 days and was easily able to switch to only Ibuprofen and start physical therapy.""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I had to rate Accutane highly, as it did exactly as advertised. I lived with chronic cystic acne for most of my teenage years, and went on Accutane at 20. Six months of treatment, and my acne was gone. I&#039;m 37 now, and have not experienced any long term side effects other than having my acne cured. I tried many medicines to treat the condition, but this one flat-out cured it. I would not have thought it possible.""",4
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I have had this implant in for a little over a year now and it was the worst descision I have made regarding birth control. After I had it put in, my body acted the same way before the implant. After about 3 months I had gained 10 pounds after not gaining any weight at all before the procedure. Now I have un predictable periods that can last from 3 days to 3 weeks with almost no break in between. There can be heavy bleeding at times or just some spotting. I waited to see if the side effects would become less of a problem over time like the doctor said but they have not so I will be getting Nexplanon removed.""",8
Ramelteon,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking rozerem for a few years now, pretty consistently. I&#039;m surprised by the low ratings. 
As one other reviewer stated, this won&#039;t knock you out cold. It&#039;s a helper. I take it 30 minutes before I go to bed. By the time that 30 minutes has passed, I&#039;m drowsy and ready to sleep. 
I can, and have, pushed through the drowsiness if I wanted to stay awake longer for whatever reason, and of course then it doesn&#039;t work. But if you go to bed and let it work, it does the job beautifully. 
I have no side effects other than feeling well rested. No hallucinations like ambien. No next-day dizziness like Lunesta. Don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do without it. 
The only downside: It is crazy expensive.""",0
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got my iud inserted on November 18 2015. I read all of these horror stories on this site and it got me freaked out to get my Iud inserted. I have had one child so insertion was absolutely painless for me. The procedure was quick and the doctor talks you through everything. Take some medications before and relax! I have had absolutely no cramping or spotting after my iud insertion. The only thing I have noticed is sometimes I&#039;m slightly more irritable. Do not let these stories scare you into not getting an iud. Most people don&#039;t write about the positive experiences just negative.""",8
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""Update from 8/17 post. I have dropped a total of 27 pounds (started at 230). There is no doubt this medicine works well but keep in mind I am highly motivated and work out 4-5 times a week. Belviq works really well on sugar cravings. I think this product will be very good for alcoholics, although I am not a heavy drinker my craving and interest in alcohol have gone way down. So now it is maybe one glass of wine with dinner instead of two or three. I am paying $145 with discount but worth it.""",2
Escitalopram,Depression,"""The first six weeks were hell.  Increased anxiety so severe I lost seventeen pounds. I&#039;m now five months in and have never felt better.  I&#039;m on 20 mg  of lexapro once daily 20mg of Buspirone twice daily.  .5 mg of Clonazepam to be taken once daily if needed, I rarely need it.  I would suggest trying a physician that will prescribe a low dosage of Clonazepam from the start, it would have saved me a great deal of suffering .  Clonazepam is addictive so most doctors hesitate to prescribe it straight out of the box.  Good luck and stick with it.""",5
Topamax,Obesity,"""I haven&#039;t been on Topiramate very long, only a couple of months.  Started taking it for RLS (restless leg syndrome).  I was really surprised to see that it is sometimes used as a weight loss medicine. I didn&#039;t really notice any difference in my appetite.  However, my last visit to doctor did show that I&#039;ve lost 5lbs.  I don&#039;t like the tingling, crawling skin sensation side effect.  That went away after a few days.""",2
Cariprazine,Bipolar Disorde,"""My daughter has severe austism and was given this for it. This medication started out for about two weeks calming behaviors of my child. Then around the third week, my daughter became more disengaged at home and at school. The staff at her school said she seemed spooked when they walked in the hallways, a therapist said she appeared to be looking through her. My child had the skill of saying when she needed to go to the bathroom, and initiating  each day to take a bath. After about two weeks on this medication she lost those skills, no longer mentioned she wanted to take a bath on her own and when I tried taking her a bath she was resistant to it and when I would take her to the bathroom to use the restroom she was resistance. She also became constipated. Thank goodness I took her off this.""",6
Prozac,Depression,"""I&#039;m 22. Had been suffering with depression and a little social anxiety since I was about 12. I finally mustered up the courage to talk to a doctor and he prescribed me Prozac. I have been on it a month now and I&#039;m doing a whole lot better with the depression but not so much my anxiety. The first 2-3 days were the worst I have had in a long time. But after those I started feeling great. It makes me drowsy and I&#039;m able to have sex normally but I can never finish.""",5
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve only been on latuda 2 weeks (20 mg) so I&#039;m rating this medication based on short-term use. 

It&#039;s been wonderful so far. I&#039;ve been on Lamictal + Neurontin for the past year and a half, and I was rapidly cycling instead of feeling genuinely stable or good. 

Latuda has really stabilized me. I feel &quot;good&quot; every day, if not really good/great. I have energy, but not manic/frenzied/restless. &quot;Good mood&quot; for me always carried the additional symptom of manic/tormenting agitation. 

I was afraid to take an antipsychotic because of the fear of weight gain. However, I have had no weight gain so far on Latuda. My appetite has been the same. 

I am also sleeping well. Latuda helps me fall asleep. No major side effects.""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""My whole life I&#039;ve had trouble getting to sleep so I&quot;m always not fully rested and would sleep in late every day.  I took 5mg under the tongue at first that works great - within 45 mins I&#039;m relaxed enough to sleep.  Now, however I&#039;ve had to take 10mg after a year of taking 5 doesn&#039;t put me to sleep.  Never done anything weird on Ambien unless I had a beer before taking it.  Unfortunately I&#039;ve used 2.5mg occasionally just to rest 2-3 hours before bed.  Doesn&#039;t seem to have any negative effects but may be addictive.  Haven&#039;t tried a night without it since a year ago.""",0
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Well, I never thought I&#039;d ever share it, but yeah.

Accutane destroyed my sex drive.
It&#039;s not that I can&#039;t get an erection or anything, it&#039;s just that. When I start having a sexual intercourse withmy girlfriend, I don&#039;t last long at all. I can barely ever get her to come and it&#039;s pretty hard on my self esteem. You may say - &#039;Why don&#039;t you foreplay more?&#039; There&#039;s a limit to foreplay, get real.

Regardless, I&#039;m not going to die from this, I&#039;ve been through worse.
However, I completely recommend AVOIDING ACCUTANE AT ALL COST.

You&#039;d rather have problems with sex than having acne? 
That&#039;s the worse mistake you can ever make.
That&#039;s.. The worse mistake I ever made.

My acne did go away - not completely, but it did prove to be very efficient on the acne""",4
Strattera,ADHD,"""I took my 1st 10mg, I ate 1/2 peanut butter sandwich with banana and cup of coffee, within hour and half I was nauseous and gagged. I had hot flashes throughout morning. I felt better by late afternoon, I lay in bed all night long beginning at 9pm trying to fall asleep, I may have a total of two hours. It is time to get ready for work and I am exhausted, I have to eat breakfast and start all over again- I am sure I can endure these beginning effects but plan on calling Doctor.""",1
Aviane,Birth Control,"""I have been taking birth control pills for over 10 years and never experienced a single negative side (other than bloating) until taking Ethinyl Estradiol &amp; Levonorgestrel, also known as Aviane. It led to near-constant nausea and severe adult acne. A warning to women everywhere: STAY AWAY.

Ethinyl Estradiol &amp; Levonorgestrel AKA Aviane also goes by the following brand names:

Alesse, Altavera, Amethyst, Enpresse, Lessina, Levlen, Levora, Lutera, Lybrel, Nordette, Orsythia, Portia, Sronyx, Tri-Levlen, Triphasil-21, Triphasil-28, Trivora-28""",8
Adderall,ADHD,"""Adderall has changed my life. I have so much more energy, I&#039;m more alert, and can stay focused on tasks a lot easier. However, I notice when it is starting to wear off, I get really moody. So, I make sure I&#039;m not around people when that&#039;s the case. I was really worried about becoming dependent, so at least once or twice a week, I don&#039;t take it all to make sure I&#039;m not addicted. Another warning, don&#039;t take this after 1pm. You will be up all night. It sucks. Your body will be so tired and you&#039;ll want to go to sleep, but your mind is just alert and wide awake!

It really suppresses the appetite too but the longer you take it, the less effect it has!""",1
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Well, it&#039;s all hasn&#039;t been fun and games when it comes to my acne. I&#039;m a light skinned African dude of 25 and I have had acne since I was 17. Pretty long time huh? I know. It all started as some pretty rash that got me obsessed. I&#039;ve used pretty much everything except surgery; and I never went to a physician for it. All over-the-counter topical application and I touch my face pretty much all the time. It&#039;s not easy when a handsome guy gets his confidence slowly stripped everyday for almost a decade. Lol
It got worse this past month (like my pimples joined up x-men and became mutants!) and I was forced to see a physician. Retin-A to the rescue. Retin-A and Doxycycline capsules. Just 2 weeks in and I can tell I&#039;ve found the cure for acne!""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking this medication two weeks ago. I am a single mother so i exercise as much as i can. I also have a office job so i sit more than I am active for my 8 hour or more shift. I can say it has decreased my appetite and I get full much faster when I eat. As to eating smaller portions I also cut off sugar drinks all together. I have my cheat days every now and then but who doesn&#039;t? Over all i have lost 8 lbs in two weeks!!! its more than i would of lost eating a cheese burger without it. So over all I am happy about this product and hope to lose much more and cut that cheat day out once and for all. Its also gave me so much more energy. Good luck on your journey guys:)""",3
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""I have recently started Mirtazepine and read everything about it before I started taking it.  I was very sceptical as I have heard a lot of things, bad things about this medication, I have to say my experience is a good one, I started on 15mgs and my first night I slept like a log but I took it a few hours before I usually go to bed, just as well as it didn&#039;t work instantly on me, but when it did I slept really well, had some weird dreams but nothing that I couldn&#039;t handle, I had the shakes for a while after taking Mirtazepine but what I didn&#039;t get is the vigorous appetite that a lot of people have experienced, It really seemed to help my depression and feel better than I have done for many years, actually want to get out of bed now.""",5
Minocycline,Acne,"""Worst drug ever-- I am usually not allergic to any drug but I Just took it for 2 days and have the worst body pain, muscle soreness, feverishness. The list of long term side effects from this drug is appalling. As a scientist and cancer biologist I usually take extra caution as to what drugs I consume but the side effects of this drug is scary and having experienced it first hand I am stopping it just after two days of use. My face is still dry and has acne and I am close to 40. Hopefully a topical cream will help- definitely not solodyn!""",4
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I started taking Buspar about a year ago for anxiety/panic attacks. I&#039;ve taken benzodiazepines in the past but having an addictive personality, I had to stop those. Buspar saved my life. I have no fear, paranoia, or low self esteem anymore. I used to feel like the world was out to get me and that I was being judged by everyone no matter where I went. I used to have the most crippling social anxiety too, I&#039;d avoid social situations because the anxiety was so bad. Luckily Buspar erased all of that for me. Anxiety still creeps up here and then but it is absolutely nowhere close to being as bad as it was before. No side effects. I love it and will take it for a long time. At first I did get headaches but they went away a couple days later. Love it.""",7
Orlistat,Obesity,"""Just want to comment on an early review from someone saying it didn&#039;t work. The person has a BMI lower than this product is intended for and doesn&#039;t sound to eat a lot of fat so this product is unlikely to work for them. 
I have a high BMI and found that it helped my weight loss to be more consistent than dieting alone. I have changed my eating habits and haven&#039;t had any negative side effects. You need to put effort in and can&#039;t expect it to do all the work for you.""",2
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have ADHD and Bipolar Type 2. I started seeing Depakote&#039;s first signs of mood stabilization after a week on 500mg daily (a very small dose). It was great to have a clear mind. At the low dose I&#039;ve been on, I would say my Bipolar symptoms are about 75% under control, which is great. I can also sleep easier.

In terms of side-effects, all I&#039;ve gotten are vivid dreams on a nightly basis (not nightmares, but sometimes uncomfortable) and very brief auditory hallucinations (hear a loud bang, like a door closing, stuff like that). The hallucinations happen about two times per night, but I&#039;ve been through worse hallucinations on SSRIs, so I am not too concerned. I also take between 20 and 30mg Dexedrine ER per day for my ADHD. 

It&#039;s been 3 weeks""",6
Bupropion,Depression,"""I have been on Wellbutrin for 2 weeks now. I am not sure if it just isn&#039;t working or if it is actually making things worse.  Crying, sleepless, anxious, restless. Don&#039;t know whether I should quit taking it or not.  Doctor is on vacation this week,  will see him the following week.
Was on Effexor for about 3 years. It worked great for me,  but somehow I decided I didn&#039;t need it anymore,  within a month I realized I was wrong. Tried going back on it but it caused horrible side effects.""",5
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I started taking Cymbalta and I noticed a difference immediately!  I felt more relaxed and happy in general.  I take Lamictal for Bi-Polar disorder and after finding that medicine alone not being enough, my dr prescribed Cymbalta.  I&#039;ve been in a pleasant mood with my family, friends and at work.  Not stressing out about leaving the house or having a busy schedule and getting anxiety about it.  It has also helped with my lower back pain I have been dealing with the last 3yrs.  It&#039;s only been 2 weeks and the only thing I can say is, I seem to yawn a lot and have less of an appetite.  If it messes with my sex drive and lowers it... I&#039;m off it.""",5
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""Reading some of these reviews has made me feel SO much better.  I started this BC about 6 months ago, and while my acne/face was certainly not perfect beforehand, it has gotten SOOOOO MUCH WORSE since starting this.  Horrible, huge, painful cystic acne - repeatedly, especially on the cheeks.  I do not wear makeup at all, so no reason for my pores to be this oily and clogged.  Honestly, I am about to just stop taking it, it&#039;s really not worth it for me (especially as I&#039;m on it for acne and period maintenance and don&#039;t even have a partner at the moment).  I&#039;ve been on several other types of BC over my lifetime - Yaz, Yasmin, Gianvi, Ventura, probably others way back in the day.  Absolutely none of those made my face look as bad as this.""",4
Focalin,ADHD,"""My 9 yr old son who has ADHD and ODD has been on Focalin XR for roughly 5 months now after going through 3 other different medicines for his ADHD that produced a lot of side effects. He dropped down to 42 lbs. VERY SCARY, and he would refuse to eat, period. He also takes 1 mg of Risperdal at night.
He has a very high tolerance and is given 40 mg of Focalin XR daily. This is the only drug I have found that does not affect his appetite. He eats non stop when he gets home from school until he goes to bed at night. It has calmed him down  but it seems to wear off after 6 hours. Other than that, this medication is GREAT and I will continue to give it to my son.""",1
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I really wanted to have a more positive experience on Errin, but it just wasn&#039;t a good fit for me. After a month bi-weekly periods, I started spotting every other week and as a result it felt like I was constantly PMSing. I gained about 8 pounds of water weight and I felt uncomfortable and bloated almost all day every day. Lastly, I just didn&#039;t feel like myself on Errin. I would get very inconvenienced by small things, it made me very emotional, and it was even hard to get out of bed in the morning some days. It also kept my psoriasis breakouts pretty constant. 

I asked my doc if I could take some time off instead of starting a new pack and within 5 days I was back to a normal weight, skin cleared, and felt like myself.""",8
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Miracle. I have been on 6 different medications over a 10 year period since I was 17 and nothing seemed to be working.  My family doctor was no longer capable of helping me and I was referred to a psychiatrist.  He immediately recognized my symptoms, put me on Lamictal, and I feel like a new man.  The suicidal thoughts, the racing, the lack of sleep...all of it reduced down to almost nothing.  I still have anxiety at times, but I take a Xanax every now and then to just help me calm down.  But overall, my quality of life has improved by 99%.  I do, much to my embarrassment, seem to have erectile dysfunction.  It is not that I have a problem getting an erection, but it seems to be a self confidence issue. """,6
Xanax,Anxiety,"""Starting on .25 dosage and has helped my anxiety enormously. Have to say that has also helped my depression as well. I got my 1st good noghts sleep in months. Helps with panic attacks as well. I think sleep depravation plays a major role in scattered thoughts and feeling of hopelessness. Once we start getting back to regular sleep patterns, we can all feel sane and less overwhelmed in our everyday lives! Good luck to all!""",7
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Buspar for about 6 yrs for anxiety and panic disorder. I started out 10 mg morning and night. When my anxiety got better, I just took it at night. 3 weeks ago I had another panic attack and have been sick with anxiety ever since. Dr. told me to start taking it twice a day again, which I did and already better. I don&#039;t tolerate antidepressants at all....so this medicine is a miracle for me.""",7
OxyContin,Pain,"""I have worked the coal mines all my life. About 5 years ago, I was in a major mine accident. After 7 orthopedic surgeries, I realized I was going to have to live with this horrible pain. It was so bad that the thought of suicide lingered in my mind so often it became my only thought. That was until I went and saw my family doctor. He started me on Vicodin, then Percocet and a list of others. I didn&#039;t have much luck with all those other medicines. Finally, he put me on Oxycontin. What a difference it made in my mental health and my physical well being. Now I take the 80 mg three times a day and I can finally live again. I still get horrible breakthrough pain at times but even with that, my life is so much better.""",9
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Retin-A is a life-changer. I struggled with moderate acne from about age 12. I tried Differin in high school, with some minor success, but still got plenty of breakouts and my skin was dull. 
I went to the doctor and got Retin-A about 2 years ago, and it is a miracle product. My skin is beautiful. I routinely get compliments on my skin from friends and family, and can name multiple instances in which perfect strangers have told me that I have stunning skin. My skin is smooth and seems to glow. A plus is that Retin-A prevents wrinkles, so now that I&#039;m in my twenties and preparing to see my first fine lines, I am happy to have that added benefit. 
TIP: Give this stuff 6 months to work. I almost gave up and am glad I held out.""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am updating my previous review from 1/19/2017. I have now up to the full dose of Contrave
(2  morning, 2  night). I have never experienced ANY stomach upset, ANY headache, or any other listed side effect except I noticed on the first day when I up my dose I am extremely fatigued but was fine within 24 hours. I&#039;ve quit craving an evening cocktail, sugar, and fast food and I stop eating when I&#039;m full rather than stuffed. The 4-pill regimen has only been for about a week but I can certainly tell a difference. I will post an update when I notice any changes.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""UPDATE: 
I started taking phentermine 37.5 mg. on July 19th weighing 177lbs, today is July 30th and I weigh 169lbs. so I&#039;m down 8lbs. I don&#039;t take the medicine everyday sometimes I skip 1 or 2 days &amp; I only take 1/2 a pill to cut down on the side effects plus I don&#039;t want my body becoming dependent on this because I won&#039;t be on it long. I&#039;m happy with my loss &amp; sure it could be more but I&#039;m trying to do this the right way as safe as possible. Will give you another update when I reach my 1st goal of losing 20lbs.""",3
Duragesic,Pain,"""I have been on Duragesic for past 2 years. I&#039;m on a dose of 150mcg every 72 hours. I have Sickle Cell Anemia and have intolerable back pain on a daily basis. These patches work wonders for my pain but I am a girl who loves to take baths. Just letting you know that you should not take really hot or really long baths while on the patch. I did and I thought I was going to die. My heart began to race and I had trouble breathing. After I struggled to get out of bathtub my husband snatched the patches off, scrubed the area they were at and I started feeling better in about 10-15 minutes. I love it for the pain but hate it for my baths.""",9
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""I was put on this medication for anxiety that I experienced suddenly. My initial panick atattack was so bad that I had throat paralysis. I could not make myself swallow, scariest thing ever. I was on paxil 20mg for 6 months before I stopped. The medication helped with the anxiety but the zero sex drive, constantly sleepy feeling and deep yawns with vivid crazy dreams along with 15 pound weight gain was terrible and not worth it.""",7
Copper,Birth Control,"""I had Paraguard inserted approximately ten months ago. I had been on the birth control pill for ten years or so, but was unable to continue taking hormonal birth control due to issues with migraine headaches and the potential for stroke. This left me with Paraguard as the ONLY birth control option for me. Insertion took only a few minutes but was intense. I have never had painful cramping or heavy periods, and the insertion cramps felt like they could have been real contractions. This pain lasted about a day and returned in time for my next period. I have never felt pain like this before. I am almost a year into having this IUD, and the pain is only just NOW getting slightly better. Still require heavy duty pain medication to get through it""",8
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve taken Ambien more than 10yrs ago had a scary reaction,  I&#039;ve also taken OTC Sleep Aids including Benadryl is a complete waste sometimes with Benadryl I&#039;d end up waking up in middle of night having to take more &amp; so on!  LUNESTA IS THE ONLY THING THAT EVER WORKED FOR ME. I&#039;d take it 30 mins before bed but my husband would literally have to pick me up off couch and put me in bed because it worked faster than 30 mins I&#039;d wake up feeling fabulous...I also can tell you when I was pregnant in my last trimester they gave me 5mg of Ambien bc they didn&#039;t know much about Lunestas effects during pregnancy...so I took half of 5mg didn&#039;t work took entire 5mg didn&#039;t work!  LOVE LUNESTA!""",0
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Nexplanon in Dec 2013. The insertion was painless and I only had a bruise for about a week. 2 weeks after I got it, I got my period which was super light and lasted for 10 days. It&#039;s almost Feb 2014 and I haven&#039;t gotten a period since. I love Nexplanon and highly recommend it! You don&#039;t have to worry about it for 3 years and it&#039;s the most reliable form of birth control. Love it!""",8
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""My liver has always looked fine on ultrasounds.  Since I&#039;ve been taking Seroquel (4 years)  my liver is enlarged, fatty and dense. However, I have been on various anti depressive meds for 35 years and the liver has to process this every day. It also made me drowsy. Don&#039;t know if Seroquel made my liver this way or just all the years on meds. I am currently coming off Seroquel and onto Lamictal and Rexulti. Fingers crossed! Good luck to you all, it&#039;s a very tough condition to live with!""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve taken both ambien and ambien CR. it caused interesting side effects from day one. I found that whatever was on my mind before taking the meds (I.e. I had to do laundry/clean the house the next day or go to a sale) I&#039;d end up getting up and doing them that night before falling asleep and not even remember it the next day!! I would vacuum at 2am, cook whole meals, get in my car to go to a tech store sale and come home with 100 movies (some 2 or 3 copies!)! My husband didn&#039;t mind the extra wild sex! It would have been nice if I would have remembered it too! The last straw for me was when a close family member passed away, I couldn&#039;t get rest so I took one to help. A month later, I found I had an accident I didn&#039;t remember! Be careful!""",0
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking Contrave for 4 days.  I am 5&#039;2 1/2 and wgt 156.  I was taking phentermine but then I began to read about contrave and asked my Dr. for it. I have been taking it only four days I don&#039;t feel anything.  Does this medicine have to be taken for a while before it kicks in. I take one in the AM. I don&#039;t have any of the symptoms that I read about. I not sure about the cravings or eating to much because I feel like it may be a placebo effect.  Did anyone else have this kind of feeling.?  Should I just give it more time to kick in.?  Its not an inexpensive drug to keep taking if it doesn&#039;t work. I hope I am wrong and the weight loss will start happening soon as it did for some of the people I have read about.""",3
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I am a pharmacist so I did a lot of research on Saxenda before deciding to try it.  I have tried other weight loss medication before without any benefit, just side effects.  I have taken Saxenda for 2 and a half weeks, I have lost 6 lbs.  I&rsquo;m doing a slower titration on the dose 0.6 x 14 days then up to 1.2mg for the last few days.  The day I increased the dose to 1.2mg I felt bloated and burped all day long- I hardly ate a thing!  I felt much better the second day. 
My biggest concern is I can not afford it!  I got 1 sample pen from my doc, she has another waiting for me to pick up.  My insurance will not cover it.  The cost for a month supply is $1198!  That is $14,376/year!  Who can afford that? I guess the sample will be my last use.""",2
Wellbutrin SR,Depression,"""Do not take this medication if you have a pre-existing anxiety disorder...even if you are on a benzo or buspirone before starting it.  My anxiety was well controlled with an SSRI and buspirone, but my depression did not seem to be getting any better.  My Psychiatrist tried switching me from the SSRI to 100 mg Wellbutrin SR.  I could only take the Wellbutrin for 6 days.  It gave me horrible panic attacks, racing heartbeat, and severe sweating.  I have no doubt it may work well for depression, but it is a bad drug to try if you have depression and generalized anxiety disorder.  I am now back on the SSRI.  I would rather deal with some depression than have panic attacks!""",5
Mirena,Birth Control,"""Due to my age (42) and the need for contraceptive and relief from having my period last 2 of 4 four weeks after my second child, I was advised that the Mirena was the best option. I was concerned about having several fibroids which I was diagnosed as having when I was 30. So, Mirena inserted.  The bleeding was inconsistent for 12 months. My doc said give it 3 mths, then 6 mths, then 9 mths. No change.  After the first month it was noticable that my belly was sticking out. I gained weight around the middle that I could not budge. Had it taken out and felt normal again the next day. Then my period came, with a vengeance. I believe my body stored my menstrual blood which made my fibroids bigger than before. Back to the gyno for me.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""Been on Contrave for a month. I GAINED WEIGHT! 4 LBS and terrible side effects, dry mouth and constant headaches for the first two weeks and night sweats which have finally stopped. When I take the full dose, I can&#039;t sleep and feel dizzy. I will use up the rest of the bottle and see what happens. Just started the 21 Day Fix and see if I can lose the 4lbs I gained. 
Also the Scale Down scale is inaccurate. compared to my weight watchers that is right next to it, Scale Down is 1.5 lb more.""",2
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have had problems with insomnia for years. After 8 years of taking Ambien, which worked great for several years, I built up a tolerance and asked my doctor about switching medications. He prescribed Trazodone, and after reading reviews, I had high hopes for the medication. Unfortunately, it did little to help my insomnia and left me with severe congestion and a headache. After 4 or so hours I would wake up with my mind racing and was unable to sleep. My doctor added klonopin. I feel asleep quickly but rarely got more than 4 or 5 hours of sleep a night. Very disappointed.""",0
Tramadol,Pain,"""Tramadol is a drug that does not work for everyone. I found that different generic brand of tramadol work better than others. I have had the best luck with teva and mylan. The others give me a horrible headache, and dont do anything for my back pain. Also the less you take the better off you are. I take 6 pills a day that are 50mg. I take them 2 at a time every 8 hours. Some people have a hard time finding mylan , teva , and northstar generics. You just have to do the leg work. I get the mylan at walmart. Most places have amneal, and caraco because its cheaper. I can say the brand name ultram is the best by far, and cvs will order it for me, but 180 pills is way to much for me. If you can afford the brand name ultram go for it.""",9
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve tried so many antidepressants but this one has been the best. I was on 10mg for a month and just had my dosage increased to 20 mg, two days ago. I do feel sick; nausea and a little disoriented but those are bearable side effects to me. I have had energy, better concentration but the biggest thing I love about this antidepressant is that I have my sex drive back. My libido wasn&#039;t affected like it has been in the past with other meds; I&#039;ve actually had increased sex drive. So far I feel &quot;okay&quot; but hopefully since 20mg is the therapeutic dose, that I feel more &quot;content&quot; or &quot;happy&quot; with my life soon. """,5
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking Ambien for years now. It began losing its effectiveness sometime ago. I can usually fall asleep after taking it, but now only sleep a few hours and can&#039;t get back to sleep. I started with 10 mg of Belsomra at midnight and it did not allow me to fall asleep. At 2:30, I took another 10 mg. I did wake a few times. With Ambien that would have been it for me. I would have been up the rest of the night. With 20 mg of Belsombra I easily fell back asleep. I did not experience any bad dreams. If fact, quite the opposite. The sleep was heavenly and I didn&#039;t want to wake up. It was the best sleep I&#039;ve had in years. Because I didn&#039;t get to sleep until 3 am, I slept until noon. I hope I can regulate this in the future. Cost is worrisome""",0
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""Given the length of time (10 years) I&#039;ve been on the medication, my doctors don&#039;t want to take me off it because of the addictive issues. It still works extremely well if I take it in time (when I feel that an anxiety attack is getting ready to start). After the onset of the attack, the medication no longer works.

Even though I developed additional anxiety issues, my doctors don&#039;t want to use it for that because it will only be feeding my addiction and not the condition.""",7
Diclofenac,Pain,"""I fell and injured my knees.  I have had pain for three weeks.  With one application of this medication I was pain free.  Of course I am in the process of x-rays and an MRI if needed.  I really like this drug.  I only wish my insurance would cover it on the lower end.  I cannot afford to keep using it at the price it is now.  It is NOT very expensive but I am on a limited budget.  I give this medication a 10 if not more.""",9
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started on Victoza in March 2013 and lost 30 pounds by Feb 2014 despite being on some psychiatric medications that can cause significant weight gain.  I was diagnosed with DM2 in 2013 and was prescribed Victoza by my endo primarily to help with weight loss.   Initially I took the injection at night starting with .6 and gradually increasing to 1.8 to minimize nausea.  I was extremely nauseated and was given Ondasetron by my endo for the first few weeks which REALLY helped.  My other doctors were a little shocked that I was given this strong, expensive anti-nausea medicine, however I persisted as encouraged by the diabetes nurse.  I recently increased dose to 3.0 and hope I can lose more weight..    I encourage you to HANG IN - it&#039;s worth it.""",2
Doxycycline,Acne,"""This really works. Battled with acne, pimples, rosacea most of my life. Been taking this for 8 months. The difference is so good. I am 44, in Australia it is a cheap medication. Doctor says to stay on it as a low dose. Worries me a bit, but having been off it only a week, my skin is awful. Chin outbreak of awful hard pimples. So I am going back on it. Hope that&#039;s not a bad thing on my body but I am far less stressed and happy.""",4
Lexapro,Depression,"""I have been on Lexapro for almost 5 months now and I am doing great. It has really helped a lot. I don&#039;t have the negative thoughts like I did and I can actually have positive thoughts. The only downside that I see is the drowsiness. But I am super sensitive when it comes to medicines that &quot;can cause drowsiness&quot;. I can function but I go around yawning a lot. That is getting better though. I have tried taking it before bed to see if that would help.""",5
Duloxetine,Depression,"""My very first time to try this medication . I thought I was gonna die ! I took it last night at 7:00pm  went to bed by 10:00 pm and I was fine. I woke up at 6:00am and I went straight to the bathroom had a bad diarrhea plus vomiting . Had to drive to work with major diziziness. And had no appetite at all. I felt so weak. I was thinking maybe it needs more time and to be more patient. Till around mid day today I had to leave work because I was so nauseous that I can&#039;t function. I called my doc and she told me to stop taking it! This medication is definitely not for me. I&#039;ve tried a lot of anti depressants like this one !!!! """,5
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Yeah it helps with sleep and depression but in the end I WAS MORE DEPRESSED THAN EVER. gained 30 pounds in 2 1/2 months!!!! Unbelievable. I was always hungry and never felt full. I was wondering why I was gaining weight NON STOP til I finally looked it up a couple weeks ago and found out that this medicine is also used to treat ANOREXIA. if you&#039;re okay with gaining weight uncontrollably then go for it!!!""",0
Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I do feel that this medication works, regular blood work to check levels in the blood are crucial.   I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 16 years and have been on this medication since the year 2000.   It worked better back then, I do have an appointment with a psychiatrist to go over the mediaction as I do not feel that it is working as good as it used to.  Perhaps my body has become immune to it.""",6
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I just started Lexapro a week and a half ago.  I noticed results almost immediately.  The only side effect I encountered was a slight light-headed feeling that has since subsided for the most part.  I have felt like hell and have been struggling with anxiety/depression for the past six years without medication.  This stuff has literally saved my life.  I feel like my old self again.  My only regret is that I didn&#039;t try it sooner.""",7
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I too take it at night for insomnia and do get RLS sometimes. However if I go to bed within 1 hour after taking it, I don&#039;t get the RLS , I&#039;m sleepy by then anyway. What I really like about this medication is when I do wake up during the night, I fall back to sleep within a few minutes. Only downside I&#039;ve found is it&#039;s kind of hard to wake up in the morning sometimes. It also helps keep my moods steady during the day and I don&#039;t have as many anxiety episodes.""",0
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I found out I was bipolar about a month ago. The first pill my PCP gave me was Abilify. Starting on 2mg for the first 2 weeks. I didn&#039;t notice anything until maybe the third day. However the rest of that week and the following I have been on a roller coaster. I just started taking 5mg of Abilify and I notice the next day. I had the feeling of being normal again. Only side effect I&#039;ve notice was when I was depressed I was depressed. Since upping the dose I feel way better.""",6
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I cried for the for the first week on Buspar which for me is expected when taking a new medication. Once that week was over Buspar came to the rescue. Buspar has given me progress in my recovery and has dented that wall of fog. It has helped me purge most of my guilt and resentment and helped me notice some of my defects. I am only taking 10mg right now. And after trying a number of different anti anxiety medications I think I&#039;ve found the one. All hail Buspar. """,7
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Lost 62 pounds in about 8 months, and it&#039;s still coming off. No side effects. I&#039;m ecstatic. Note: it took a little over a month before I saw results. Two pills a day (I suggest 30 minutes prior to meals). Get full blood work and cardio first, blood rechecks quarterly. I now feel much fuller with smaller portions. Folks, diet is probably 90% of weight loss! Choose a small subset of low cal, filling foods and stick with those. Rotate when burned out. Egg whites, poultry are a staple for me. Eliminate all breads and sugar! Drink water. On the fence? Remember, obesity kills. Use &quot;myfitnesspal&quot; app or similar and record everything that goes into your mouth. Bottom line: for me, I&#039;m less of a man than I was months ago - and I&#039;m happy about that!!""",3
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I was previously on Adderall XR before going on Vyvanse. My reason for switching was because I suffer from BED as well, which this drug is basically a miracle drug for. As far as how this drug functions as an ADHD med, I do not think it is as effective as Adderall but it does last for a really long time, which has its pro&#039;s and con&#039;s. If you take it too late, you will have a hard time sleeping and if you want to go to happy hour or grab a drink that day, because this drug takes anywhere from 9-11 hours to leave your system, you won&#039;t be able to feel the effects of alcohol or the effects of the alcohol will all kick in at once Vyvanse leaves your system (be warned). But if you want to get a lot done during the day, its good.""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""In England my mother took me to the doctor and being a nurse herself knew I had ADHD.  The doctors wanted to put me on Ritalin but my mother said no, I would grow out of it eventually. In the US my attention from high school through college became worse, and I got into a lot of trouble. My grades were horrible in high school through college, even work. I had to take classes two to three times over again. The only way I would remember daily things was to write it down.  Now at 41, I got help, and I am able to focus, complete tasks, remember without asking ten times, and sit still.  It&#039;s never too late for help.  Just wish I would of done this 35 years ago. My anger has subsided also with no side effects.""",1
Topamax,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking this medicine several weeks ago with a combination of Celexa for my depression. The side effects are unwelcome and welcome all in the same time. I have memory loss and can&#039;t find the the right words when I&#039;m speaking to people. I feel tired during the day, but at night I&#039;m wide awake. My nails have become thinner, so has my waist line. I&#039;ve struggled with my weight since I was young, [I&#039;m 17 and I started these pills at 260lbs. I&#039;m now at 231lbs]. These pills make me feel like food is the enemy. I&#039;m also having decreased sensitivity during sex.""",6
Butorphanol,Pain,"""I went to the ER with aneurysm symptoms and was administered Stadol Via IV. The nurse explained that it would make me sleepy and help with the pain in my head. Immediately I felt a little sleepy followed by nauseous and very  warm all over. Within a few minutes I started to feel VERY uncomfortable in my own skin. I felt as if I had a horrible hangover or something. As I fell asleep I began having horrible nightmares. This experience was the first time I&#039;ve been given the drug to my knowledge. Overall it made me feel kind of panicked and frightened. I hopefully will never be given this medication again.""",9
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My son started this 8 weeks ago. It has been a miracle. He has ADHD, BIPOLAR 2, ODD, and being tested for TBI. This has made his impulsivity manageable . We have had no side effects. We have stayed at 2 mg. We are on quite a few other medicines also. But since we have started this medicine we have not had any CPEP visits or inpatient stays. Prior to this medicine in 1 year we had 6 inpatients and 12 CPEP. His other medicines worked but we could not stop his impulse factor which was putting his life in danger. I have my son back we can actually have a conversation again.""",1
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed with BiPolar Disorder 1 about 8 months ago. My doctor put me on Seroquel 100mg. I do have to take it at night due to the drowsiness it causes. It has made a dramatic change in the racing thoughts and negative self-image I felt. I&#039;ve also had a marked change in my insomnia. I was misdiagnosed for a number of years, and couldn&#039;t understand why the other meds didn&#039;t make a difference. I wake up feeling rested. I did have some vivid dreams when I first began taking it. I also get the munchies, but they have subsided considerably in the last month or two, and have dropped almost 20 pounds. This is magical as far as I&#039;m concerned! As well as the Seroquel, I also take 20 mg of Lexapro and 600 mg of Neurontin every night. Thanks!!""",6
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""27 years old 5&#039;10 204lbs I suffer from major depressive disorder and sleep apnea that was thought to be narcolepsy because of how damn tired am I during the day.  I have tried most if not all the Adhd meds. None of them seem to really help me pay attention much. They are somewhat helpful more for wakefulness. Phetermine although seriously dangers worked the best. I&#039;d say vyvanse second best, However compared to Adderall XR 20mg twice a day I&#039;d say is very similar effect if not better than vyvanse 70mg and it&#039;s more convenient to be able to split up two tabs when you need to space dosses apart or save for rainy day. I rated a 6 stars based on what I&#039;d like it to do compared to what it does for me. I have pretty high tolerances in general""",1
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I am 24 years old, I had to stay awake during the nights of the last week due to a university exam. four days after the exam is finished i can not sleep well because my bed time has changed. and i feel so tired during the day. last night at 2:45 am I took one (50 mg) Tab and after 30 - 40 min i slept deeply. At 9:00 am (after 6 hours) I woke up feeling little bit heavy and sleepy, so I went beck to sleep for another 2 hours. After that I woke up feeling fresh and energetic like if i had a good continous sleep through the night.""",0
Zoloft,Bipolar Disorde,"""Zoloft&#039;s been a life saver for me. I&#039;ve been stable for over ten years.  I&#039;ve had to have my dose adjusted but that&#039;s part of life. It hasn&#039;t made me manic, knock on wood. My friends and family are a huge support. I take my medicines as directed, and I don&#039;t use alcohol or other drugs. No serious side effects. My doctor&#039;s also very careful. I get upped or lowered slowly and he watches me closely. The only hard time with Zoloft was running out. I did get withdrawls.""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hi.
I have been taking phentermine 30mg since 23rd April 2016. I have lost 7lbs I currently weigh like 205 I need to get down to 140 really. My symptoms have been dry mouth, interrupted sleep as I wake up like sometimes before 5 and can&#039;t get back to sleep. I was told the sleep pattern will change soon. I have had weight loss which is good but last few days my weight is staying the same where as before everyday would go down at least 1lb. Anyway I guess maybe it is slowing down and it will end up being 2 -3lbs of weight loss a week. But I guess that&#039;s healthier anyway. Oh I am in UK I think that&#039;s why your dosage is higher. They have restrictions here on some of the medication you have there that&#039;s the problem I think.""",3
Nortriptyline,Pain,"""I have been taking nortriptline for a little over a month now and have found it has helped in several areas of my life.  I have been suffering from headaches for over 10 years due to nerve trauma from a wisdom tooth extraction.  I have been on every medication under the sun and then some.  Usually strong narcotics and several at a time with no real results at all.  I have also suffered from chronic depression, anxiety and panic attacks.  I happened to see a doctor not my own who asked if I would be willing to try it.  Why not can&#039;t hurt was my thought.  I am so grateful for his suggestion, I have stopped taking the narcotics and anxiety/depression medicines. I am currently at 50mg going to start 60mg with no side effects other than dry mouth.""",9
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""This is my second time on paroxetine after suffering with severe panic attacks and depression, I was a complete wreck but had to do something quickly! I tried all the self help programmes as well but nothing worked! The doctor put me on another medicine first (sertraline). I was in a state after 3 weeks and severe insomnia, weight loss due to no appetite! So I decided to go back to paroxetine. I started on 5mg and slowly went up to 20mg over about 5 weeks, I&#039;m now feeling so much better, this medicine has helped me get back to my old self and I&#039;m thankful for that! I&#039;m in the UK so don&#039;t pay insurance.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I had my Nexplanon inserted one year ago and have loved it. I was on the 3 month shot before this birth control. My arm was severely bruised after having it inserted, but that was to be expected. There were no side effects from switching birth controls, which I was extremely happy about. I&#039;m only 19 years old and having this for three years was the best decision my mother and I could have made. The only symptoms I&#039;ve experienced have been a little weight gain (10-15 pounds) &amp; going from dry skin to oily. Other then that I have had no problems with my Nexplanon and would encourage anyone who is thinking about using this.""",8
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I got diagnosed with bipolar, this year in the month of may. At first I talked to a counselor who referred me to a nurse practioner/ psychologist. After telling them my feelings and life experiences they definetly said I was bipolar when I met with the psychologist. She gave me medication the first day. I started off taking just 25 mg then after 2weeks 50 then after I finished that 100 then after that 200. When I first started taking the small doses . I didn&#039;t see any changes in my behavior and that made me very hopeless and angry and I feel like nothing could help me. But once she uped my dose  I feel like a human again. When I tell you I feel good I fell so good that I could fly with a kite and the birds. I feel like my old self again.""",6
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I just started the pill (phentermine 37.50) a week ago. I love that I don&#039;t feel hungry. I don&#039;t have any side effects other than a dry mouth.  I do have high blood pressure and my pressure has been fine.  I take it first thing in the morning so that it won&#039;t keep me up at night.  I started at 200lbs and I am 5&#039;7&quot; and now I am 192.5 pounds, a loss of 7.5lbs in 1 week.  I do work out about 4 times a week and I just started to eat more salads and I still do eat pizza once in a while.  My appetite has really decreased and sometime I have to make myself eat. I still drink red wine twice a week. I am trying to reach 140lbs.  I will continue to post to this site.  I drink water all the time but I need to anyway.""",2
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on contrave since January 2016, starting weight of 253lbs. I&#039;m down to, and holding at 185 lbs!

I&#039;ve had a few minor side effects such as headaches and minor nausea but it lessened to the point of being almost unnoticeable. 

One positive side effect is my libido has increased tremendously. I feel like I&#039;m 18 years old again and my wife simply can&#039;t believe it. Not sure if she is happy about it or not. My physician told me it&#039;s likely a placebo effect, but if I&#039;m happy, then no worries. Oh, yeah, I&#039;m happy.""",2
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I suffer from severe social and general anxiety. Started on lexapro about a month ago. Took 10mg daily for 3 and 1/2 weeks with little results. I would always check these reviews because I saw how much it had changed many people&#039;s lives so I was trying to stay optimistic. side affects were tough the first week but went away quickly. Not much help with anxiety, all I really noticed was a &quot;cloudy headed&quot; feeling all day. Don&#039;t give up taking it though! This drug does wonders for many people.""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""Doxycycline worked great at first, my skin cleared up super fast, but then after a while I still continued to get a few zits here and there. One of my greatest complaints is how sensitive it made my skin to the sun. I am outside a lot and I used to never get burned, but since on the medication I get severely burned on random places like my nose, hands, ears and feet? I get burned so bad that 2 hours in the sun (with some sunscreen) would result in scanning of my nose and ears. I have recently switched medicine because of this side effect, but if you don&#039;t go in the sun you should love the product!""",4
Nucynta,Pain,"""I have L5-S1 problems and S1 renervation/denervation causing mild foot drop plus I just had SLAP tear (shoulder) surgery in February of this year.  I&#039;ve used Tramadol for so many years that I&#039;m pretty much immune to it and I can&#039;t sleep if taken past 4PM.  Nucynta acts totally opposite for me. I take it with 75mg of Lyrica and 0.25mg of alprazolam before bed and I&#039;m sleeping better than ever. Nucynta might make you nod.  I&#039;m a hyper person and it puts me down. Enjoy!""",9
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I found this medication actually here after researching weight loss drugs about 3 months ago. Happy to report 3 months 18 pounds lighter. Cravings gone. Snacking gone. Meal portions? About half of what they used to be and not because I force myself. That is the beauty. I don&#039;t want to or need to eat more! Simple. I like simple. Clean drug. No side effects for me. Glad I will be taking this beyond 3 months.""",3
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I lost about 40lbs through changing my eating habits and regular exercise over a period of about 18 months, but I had hit a plateau. I was referred to a weight loss clinic by my co-workers, who are having great success with phentermine. After my first week of taking phentermine 37.5, I was constantly famished, and tired. At the 3 week marker (down 6 lbs), I requested to switch to Adipex. I noticed a difference the very first dose. I&#039;m on day 3 of Adipex, and it seems to do a much more consistent job of curbing my appetite, and I don&#039;t feel sleepy. I&#039;m not overly energetic, but also not jittery, and I&#039;m
not getting the headaches. Trying it for a week before possibly checking into another option. So far, I am feeling optimistic.""",3
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""My doctor recently sent me to a pain management doctor to help control pain while recovering from my third knee surgery. Unfortunately, there will probably be a fourth surgery in the next 7 months for a complete replacement.  I had constant pain while relaxing on the couch and extreme pain while walking which caused other pain in my whole body due to not being able to walk correctly.  My doctor had me on Tramadol 50 mg 3-4 times a day which didn&#039;t take the pain away it only took the edge off but did nothing for the extreme walking pain.  My new pain doctor prescribed Opana ER 5mg twice a day, Tramadol 50mg 1-2 pills 3 times a day as needed and Neurontin for night-time burning pain.  Only side effect is slight morning headache. Opana ER is awesome.""",9
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""I took Paxil for 5 years for severe panic attacks and anxiety. I got to the point where I could barely leave the house without anxiety. I was on 20 mg once a day and it worked wonders for me. I felt &quot;normal&quot; for the first time in years. HOWEVER... I gained 50 lbs. I decided to get off and weaned myself very slowly but still had withdrawal symptoms: brain zaps, severe headaches, dizzy, restless, faint, weak and the list goes on. I have been off for 5 months now and still have symptoms. """,7
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I usually don&#039;t give reviews but for Adipex is necessary that I share with you. I started on 3/4/14 at 215 pounds, today 4/7/14 I&#039;m @ 198lbs. In only 33 days I&#039;ve lost 17 lbs. I&#039;m eating healthy and small portions, cause I don&#039;t get hungry.. I don&#039;t crave nor look for fast food restaurants. I&#039;ve added more fruits and veggies into my menu. I&#039;m staying away from sugar and bread. I&#039;m thirsty all the time, water, water is my best friend. If you are reading this I was just like you 30 days ago reading and trying to find out if this would work, and my answer is &quot;YES&quot; it does. Just take it day by day and eat right and exercise. Will give my next update at the end of April.""",2
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Belviq because I gained weight after my hysterotomy. A year later I was diagnosed with heart issues. The doctors put me on so many meds. It was horrible! I noticed the heavier I got, the worse my heart got. I was never considered overweight, but any extra weight you do, makes your heart work more. I saw a commercial on tv about this new medicine and asked my doctor about it. He said &quot;I&#039;m all for it!!&quot;. I&#039;m happy to say that after 6 months, I lost 25 pounds. I&#039;m no longer on any meds and feel great!! I felt bad the first 3 days. (Headaches, tiredness) I&#039;m so glad that I stuck to it. It was the push my body needed!! I recommend this to anyone. What do you have to lose? I&#039;m so thankful to my doctor for giving me this chance!!!""",3
Accutane,Acne,"""I had struggled with severe acne ever since I was in 6th grade. It was all over my face and even my shoulders. Of course, as you would suspect, I got bullied big time for it. My dermatologist put me on so many different types of pills that helped a little, but my acne was still horrible. Then she put me on accutane. Accutane is a miracle process is a pain and the side effects made me want to just quit. I struggled with very dry skin &amp; lips, sensitive to the sun, and soreness. I went through 6 months of the pill. I am now a sophomore in high school and I have perfectly clear and smooth skin. Yes, I still have battle scars but they are tiny. I have never been so happy with myself. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.""",4
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I have been on Prestiq for ages, it did not work for me I felt continuously nauseated  I became numb of all feeling and lost who I was along the way.  In December 2015 I had unrelenting vomiting,  this included vomiting back all medication.  After 10 days I was a screaming heap, went to the Dr who prescribe Maxalon for the vomiting, this didn&#039;t work so back I went this time Stemetil, still vomiting by now off Prestiq felt awful for ages.  Gradually I noticed although still feeling nauseated was not as cranky irritable and stressed. I am still struggling with the withdrawal symptoms however, I am coping better without the medication than I thought possible.  Why is it Dr&#039;s do not listen to you when you are on medication for depression?""",5
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""Having suffered panic attacks and anxiety and depression for several years now, always have my Xanax with me in case of any unexpected panic attacks. I take 90mg of Avanza each night in addition to 2mg of Xanax twice a day. Xanax for me has been the only drug that has quick and fast acting results. I don&#039;t like flying or heights or crowds and avoid shopping centers but with Xanax can at least function each day and at least leave the house. Good luck to everyone else out there suffering the same. Try Xanax it works for me. Cheers.""",7
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on a truck-load of different medicines to treat Bipolar, Lamictal, Depakote, Lithium, Seroquel, Symbyax, Abilify...just to name a few.    Started taking this 10mg/before bed, last week. This does taste horrible, but doesn&#039;t cause nausea and vomiting and I&#039;m real sensitive to taste. It makes my tongue go numb for about 30 minutes and during that time I get the munchies really bad. While I&#039;m trying not to eat the house down my mood elevates. I&#039;ve been getting to sleep a lot easier and staying asleep better. As a whole, I&#039;m feeling better than I have in a long time. Really hoping this medicine works on the long-term for me as I&#039;m tired of trying different ones.""",6
Ramelteon,Insomnia,"""My sleep problem is describe as: ease of falling asleep; extreme-difficulty staying asleep for more than three hours; however, mostly-pleasant dream occurences. I take Ambien occasionally in attempt to fully replenish my body&#039;s energy-level. To not become dependent, on occassion I will try Rozerem. The problem then becomes, each time I take Rozerem, it causes me to sleep very lightly with what some may consider &quot;intense-Viagra Effect&quot;. It is only after I take some measure to resolve this effect that I then am able to obtain a deep sleep for about five hours; but this deep sleep is always accompanied by what I consider extremely unusual or unpleasant dreams.""",0
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I&#039;m 32 and had the Mirena IUD inserted 4 months ago. I started experiencing relentless acne on one side of my jawline almost immediately which was unsightly and embarrassing. I googled if there was a correlation between the two and found endless websites stating there was. When I read that spironolactone helped many women, I called my OB/Gyn and asked her for a prescription which she had no problem with and sent my prescription to the pharmacist without an appointment. I&#039;ve taken 25mg for only 6 days so far and have already noticed an impressive improvement without any side effects. So happy!""",4
Viibryd,Depression,"""Viibryd is the only anti-depressant that really worked for me. I tried Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor. I&#039;ll never know if those 3 medicines didn&#039;t work but the effect was subtle at best. Viibryd&#039;s impact was unambiguous. So much so that after the 3rd week I felt that 30 mg would be sufficient. My Doctor advised me to go ahead and take 40 mg and that is my current dosage. Note that I was diagnosed with co-occurring anxiety and the action of Viibryd is such that it is a very effective anti-anxiety medication, at least for me. Note that some people report an increase in anxiety with Viibryd at higher dosages.""",5
Lutera,Birth Control,"""I have taken Lutera for about a year and a half.  It is great at preventing babies and it has made my periods much better.  I do not bleed as much and my cramps are nothing compared to what they were.  However, I have gained weight - about 20 lbs.  I have tried to lose the weight and have lost a little but I have never had to try so hard to lose weight.  Much of the time it is a losing battle because since Lutera I always seem to have hunger pains.  Also, at times I feel very tired and taking caffeine only helps a little bit.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""Started at 243lb, I am down to 226lb.  Started about 5 weeks ago.  So I was finally on 4 pills a day until the 5th week but I had two days of extreme stomach ache.  I came down to 3 pills, 2 in morning and 1 at night. The weight has steadily declined about 2 to 3 pounds a week.  Truly glad I started the medication.  I have had some of the side effects. The nausea, I use peppermint or gum to overcome. Constipation and dry mouth, I drink more water.  I do get a jittery feeling but it does  go away.  No issues with sleep. Take B12 pills for energy.  So far so good.  But I am glad it is working. It was $227 under insurance but the coupon dropped it down to $99.""",2
Cymbalta,Depression,"""I have just started taking it, and I wanted to give a viewpoint from the beginning.  I have been on this for 4 days now.  The first day was really bad, but it is getting better.  My appetite is coming back now, and I am not snapping at my family like I was before I started Cymbalta.  I am still quite tired and nauseated during the day, and am still having some trouble sleeping.  Before this I used to drink a lot, and this has helped me lose the desire to drink, which in my case is a good thing.  I am going to stick with it and hopefully the rest of the side effects will go away slowly.  I already feel more positive and my family has even noticed a difference already.""",5
Citalopram,Depression,"""I am on my second round of celexa. I took it many years ago for a few years, only 10mg a day. It definitely worked but after a few years I decided to get off it. You need to ween yourself off it very slowly if you&rsquo;ve taken it for a long time. I experienced voices and hallucinations the first couple days going off it completely after I thought I had weened myself enough so I had to ween myself for another month. I had never had symptoms like that in my life. However, I got off of it. Now my depression and anxiety came back for quite a bit so I went back on celexa 20 mg and it is definitely helping. My recommendation is to avoid a lot of caffeine while on this drug or you will notice anxiety increases more so than when you&rsquo;re not on celexa.""",5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""10-20mg prescription for sleep. Took it once, felt nothing after an hour (10mg), took 10 mg more which did the trick. Next thing I was waking up wearing one sock (half way) and nothing else except underpants, shivering: aha! It had been the cold that woke me. Blankets damp. Checking sheets and mattress - relieved to find them dry. At the time I lived in a big house with 5 other college students.  I threw on some sweats and found them all gathered waiting for me.I soon learned that I had carried on like a mad man the night before:  verbally harassing my house mates before emerging from the bathroom with a water logged roll of toilet paper which I wielded like a sword. It seemed to do the trick.  I was kicked out of my house.

Lorazepam,Anxiety,""" Had a sort of nervous breakdown during a trip.  Could not catch my breath and could not sleep for 4 days.  Horrible feeling of anxiety.  Dreaded the night. Started 1mg Ativan at night only.  Was a God-send.  Worked like a charm and gave me my life back.  I went to therapy and continued the nightly 1 mg for 3 months.  Became dependent as everyone does.  I then &quot;pill chopped&quot; my way off from 1mg to less than 1/2 mg over the next 3 months.  After 6 months I was off completely.  Feel good and glad to be pill free for 5 weeks now.  Properly used  - this medicine can be a lifesaver.  I still have them for peace of mind but find now I can live without it.""",7
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""Barely 4&#039;11&quot;, age 50, started saxenda 9/10/16 at 134.  Today I&#039;m 114.4.  I&#039;m thrilled with a 19.6 loss in less than 2 months and cravings for sweets are gone. Dr. chose saxenda for me after months of no success with diet and exercise alone. Dose was .6 mg until last week.  Now at 1.2 mg.  A few days of nausea at start on .6 but none since.  Only side effect is occasional constipation.  My insurance doesn&#039;t cover saxenda and I think it&#039;s very expensive even with the savings card but it&#039;s been worth it to avoid another back surgery.""",3
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Makes me feel like I have Hay Fever. Dry sinuses, dry eyes, and dry mouth. I have had chronic insomnia ever since I was 9. Tried Zolpidem but it only works for 3 hours, Lunesta only for about 1.5, Xanax (worked for a while but found myself becoming dependant), and this which not only doesn&#039;t help me sleep for jack but also makes my wakefulness even more unpleasant. Tried dosages from 50mg to 250mg. Gonna ask my doc about Zolpidem ER. This stuff sucks.""",0
Celebrex,Pain,"""I have severe pain, stiffness, inflammation in the shoulder/arm/hand from an injury that occurred years ago.  At first it was called severe left brachial plexopathy, but it has turned into chronic pain syndrome.  At first doctors prescribed heavy meds that caused really bad side effects, so I asked dcs to change pres.   Eventually the new doctors have been prescribing gabapentin, meloxican, celecoxib, and some other medications to help my stomach.  I was on a temporary trial for an spinal stimulator, together with my medication and it improved my pain.  However, for the permanent stimulator Dr told me to stop taking celecoxib for 2 weeks before surgery...  The pain came back so bad I haven&#039;t been able to sleep at all for almost a week.""",9
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I first reviewed this in November 2010, (see past comments). I have since had ALIF surgery (anterior multi level fusion l-3, 4 and 5), and am feeling better everyday. I have been prescribed every painkiller in the book for the past year and a half, nothing provides the pain relief with minimal side effects that Nucynta does. Nothing. In the hospital I was injected with 2mg morphine every 3 hours plus oxycodone every 4 hours and was a complete zombie. Left the hospital, took 100mg Nucynta and received the same relief with no ill effects. It&#039;s been 2 weeks. Now taking 50mg 3x daily.""",9
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I was given oxycodone for pain relief in the hospital after hip replacement surgery.  The pain relief was okay, but the side effects of nausea, confusion, and weakness made me feel wretched.  Who wants to throw up repeatedly and feel pathetic after surgery?  As soon as my surgeon swapped oxycodone  for tramadol, the bad side effects disappeared. Tramadol&#039;s pain relief was comparable or better. I&#039;m amazed by all these high ratings because many friends had similar bad side effects with oxycodone.""",9
Zoloft,Bipolar Disorde,"""My original experience with Zoloft was over ten years ago, during a serious depressive episode - it seemed to be effective as a stabilizer.  This past December, a doctor prescribed it again to help pull me out of another down-turn.  Within the course of a month I progressed from severe depression to ultradian mood cycling, which resulted in a nervous breakdown.  The cycling abated within a couple weeks of discontinued treatment with Zoloft. """,6
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Before I started on methylphenidate I was using strattera 80mg, but I only got the side effect and 
sweated all the time even when doing nothing, also had dizziness and panick attacks.

When I got offered methylphenidate I could concentrate alot better and all the side effects never came, the only side effect I have is maybe sometimes palpitations but not as often. good medicination for ADHD.""",1
Concerta,ADHD,"""I have been taking Concerta 54mg for 10 years now. In early 2002, I was put on Adderall 10mg. The first day of the 10mg, I came home from school and said, &quot;I&#039;m never taking this again.&quot; Twice I tried to pick a fight with my classmates. Concerta was like a miracle. I could focus on my work (instead of splitting my attention between my work and drawings or books or video games), and I didn&#039;t feel any major side effects. A couple years after starting it, the difference, minor at first, was remarkable between the days I would and would not take it. I&#039;ve had increasing depression for the past 5 years, though, and I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s because of the Concerta...""",1
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I experience insomnia in that my mind often does not &quot;turn off,&quot; I tend to keep thinking once I lay down in bed. Over the counter sleep aids have been ineffective and leave me drowsy the day after. Ambien turns off my mind and I sleep well. Sometimes I wake up in about 5 to 6 hours, if I need a bit more sleep then I take a half pill (5 mg) for the remaining two extra hours of sleep that I need to feel well rested. I have had no side effects.""",0
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""Might try this one again someday.  Was on it 3 weeks.  Sleep started off OK but got worse with time along with feeling more anxious and exhausted each day.  3rd week, I&#039;m lying in bed and start to panic.  Try to get up and collapse on the floor.  My brain felt like it was being lightly electrocuted.  Broken sleep and nightmares the rest of the night.  Next day around 3pm, I started to feel better.  Great even and slept great that night but the night before freaked me out so much I swore to never take it again.  Withdrawals were horrific.  Worst thing I ever experienced.  Still, that one day and night was amazing and think it might have been the one if I stuck it out another day or 2.  Weird reactions, I know.  It works great for my dad.""",7
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed Seroquel 50mg a few years ago after an eighteen-year battle with constant sleep problems. And it does help me get to sleep every night; my dosage has never changed. My only complaints are the RAMPANT hunger I experience before giving in to the fatigue and the dizziness/nausea when trying to stand for too long after the effects have set in.

As far as sleeping medication goes, Seroquel takes the cake. I don&#039;t notice any psychoactive effects aside from the sedation.""",0
Paxil,Anxiety,"""Anxiety has always been a big part of my life. A younger me was able to treat it with my brain but now that I am 45 I was not able to control my fears of what bad thing will happen next. Being the father of 2 kids including a handicapped little boy plus my wife that doesn&#039;t work, she needs to take care of my little boy. My fears of losing my job, car breaking down, my son&#039;s medical condition and a bad set of eyes were some of my major worries, all things that were unrealistic and mostly out of my control. Living in fear creates more problems then solutions. I started taking Paxil about two months ago and I will tell you that it helps. I feel normal no more fear and able to deal with life&#039;s problems.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Started phentermine a week ago.  The first day I literally felt crazy. I was hot, sweaty and extremely active, water was my best friend! Now I just feel energized, not crazy lol. I don&#039;t have an appetite at all and if I go without water I get headaches (shocker).  I take it everyday with the exception of Sunday&#039;s, I know I won&#039;t drink alot of water but I still maintain my eating habits. I&#039;ve been on if for a week now and I started at 189 and today I weighed 181, so 8lbs today. I think it&#039;s great, best decision I&#039;ve made so far, gonna give another update in a month.""",3
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""This is the most honest review I can give about this medicine. Its amazing. I have been on it for one month and have lost 1 stone and 3 pounds. I go to the gym 4 times a week and I am on a controlled calorie diet. 

Please ensure that you eat breakfast first then take it 10 minutes later to ensure that the tablet is effective. I find sometimes the medicine wears off by 7pm so I try and take this pill late mornings to ensure I don&#039;t get hungry.

At the end of the day, this pill does help but you can only really help yourself. Make sure you exercise regularly. You have to put in effort to get excellent results. This is not a miracle pill.""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I was a sufferer real bad of adult acne on my back, chest and chin, and this was the only thing that worked for me. Unfortunately I suffered a drug reaction from it that left my lower extremities (rectal itch, etc) that kept me up all night....it was horrible and it took a few months for it to subside with a lower dosage and antihistamines. Lower dosage worked better but it did eventually did damage to my kidneys which is a risk side affect of taking this drug. So be aware if you have weak kidneys DO NOT take this drug!""",4
Vraylar,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started this 2 weeks ago. I have mixed manic bipolar disorder. I was on latuda and Risperdal for 3 years. I finally got off of them after the doctor realized it was messing with me. On vraylar I noticed I sleep less like only 8 hours instead of 10-12. I also feel better I don&#039;t hear voices anymore and I felt good enough to cut and color my hair. 2 weeks ago that would&#039;ve been out if the question. I&#039;ve started exercising and I&#039;ve noticed the side effect of restlessness. I hope it goes away! Overall this is a wonder drug!""",6
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""It startet a year ago with 0.5mg Clonazepam, now I am on 1.5 mg of Clonazepam, it basically stopped working for my insomnia. I went to see my doc, he prescribed me Temazepam (Restoril) which has a very short half life, half of that of Clonazepam, sure enough it didn&#039;t work! I called my doctor and he said he would call in Ativan (Lorazepam) at my pharmacy, I should take 1 mg. Ativan has an even shorter half life than Temazepam, besides the equivalent dosage of 1.5 mg Clonazepam is 3 mg! of course that 1 mg didn&#039;t do anything. And on top of that I got withdrawing symptoms from not taking Clonazepam! I called my doctor again, he was agitated and told me to take 30 mg Temazepam together with 1 mg Ativan together with 10 mg Zyprexa!!!! I fired him""",0
Nucynta,Pain,"""I was just given Nucynta 50 mg twice a day for Peripheral Neuropathy following a botched surgical procedure by my PCP.  The pain was constant and burning.  It disrupted my life and is wrecking my relationship with my husband.  He doesn&#039;t understand the pain of Neuropathy, Neuritis and Neuralgia.  I have been in pain for more than a year and I have tried many different pain medications such as Vicodin, Ultram, Percocet.  Nothing worked!  I have only taken 2 pills and I noticed that the pain is much improved.  It went from a 7 to a 4.  That is HUGE!  I did get nauseated and my breathing was shallow.  I also stumble a bit and I am not able to verbalize complete sentences.  That is disturbing, but it&#039;s worth it if I can experience less pain.""",9
Ativan,Anxiety,"""Hey Everyone, I take 2mg of Ativan a day. 1 mg in the morning and 1 mg at night before bed. I have been diagnosed with Severe Panic Attack and Depression. Lorazepam (Generic brand for Ativan) does help me. Understand that the effects for any medication is going to vary person to person. I don&#039;t get sleepy in the morning when I take it, but it does help me get a good night&#039;s sleep at night when I&#039;m tired. 

Also, I do want to say: Recently, my pharmacy didn&#039;t give me the exact amount of pills of Ativan, so I have been off of it &quot;cold turkey&quot; because I ran out and the withdrawal symptoms can be a hellish.

Note: Anybody can be dependent on any medication/drug. Talk to your Psychiatrist. REMEMBER...everyone responds to medication differently.""",7
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My 9 year old son has been taking Intuniv for about a year now and has greatly improved his behavior, mood, impulse control and more. Both myself and his dad suffer from ADHD as well but need Adderall to manage. I was so happy to see a non-stimulant medicine work so well. The only problem we&#039;ve had is excessive weight gain (excess of 30 lbs in 1 year). To the point its very worrisome. Appointment is set to switch to something new.""",1
Xanax XR,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking this medicine for 2 days and all I can say is wow! Is this what normal life is supposed to feel like? I was diagnosed with a chronic pain condition that is caused by a lifetime full of anxiety and the tightening and clenching of muscles that were not intended to be in constant use. The pit in my stomach is gone and I am actually looking forward to waking up in the morning and being able to face the day anxiety free!""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADD in forth grade, however my doctor decided to just have the school put me on a learning program, (504 Plan). Throughout the years, I started to develop depression, agitation, severe anxiety and OCD. I had tried EVERY anti-depressant, and they had all failed. My PCP started me on benzos, which helped a little. I decided it was time to go see a mental health physician assistant. She went over all my symptoms and she immediately realized that I had been mis-diagnosed and the PCP had me on about 5-6 medications. She started me on Vyvance 40 MG and my life has forever changed. I am generally very happy, and able to function, went from severe anxiety to mild, which is helped with Valium. I recommend Vyvance!""",1
Tramadol,Pain,"""I went to a orthopedic surgeon due to carpal tunnel in my left handed, which is my writing etc. hand. Doctor said surgery was the only way to go.  I started doing research on the computer adamant not to have surgery.  A doctor prescribed me tramadol 50 mg. Took for 3 weeks 1 x daily and ate pineapples daily along with zinc, garlic and muscle joint cream and within a month I am back to normal.  Its amazing what you can learn.""",9
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on this med in 2010 for a year. The dose went from 25mg up to 400mg. The first few weeks were very difficult. It knocked me out cold and I had such a blocked nose I could hardly breathe. I toughed it out and my depression lifted. I stopped taking it because of really bad blocked nose. I have just had a major depressive episode (2015) with insomnia. I was prescribed 100mg. It worked within 24 hours. I was able to sleep for 9 hours and feel refreshed and energized. The depression and anxiety have improved dramatically. This time I&#039;ll stay on Seroquel.""",6
Celexa,Depression,"""I have been on Celexa for over a year, I was quite unstable when I started Celexa but after a few months between Celexa and Geodon I evened out to a pretty much numb stable state. I guess not feeling is better then feeling bad things all the time. I&#039;m not sure how to explain it but between my meds I usually feel like an observer of my body, not fully connected to any experience I am in...dreamlike I suppose. Now I have to switch because of the interaction between the two, so we&#039;ll hope the next one is at least equivalent.""",5
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for 2 years and am now weening myself off.  I am giving this medicine a relatively high rating because it saved my social and academic life in under a month of beginning treatment.  However, after being on it for about 2 years it&#039;s effects have plateaued.  I am completely emotionally neutral to any situation.  Some may like this feeling, but I do not.  Example:  I get a D on an important term paper.  Emotion: I don&#039;t care.  Example: I get an A on an important term paper.  Emotion:  I don&#039;t care.  I&#039;d at least like to feel something from emotional stimuli.  I will either be trying a different drug or giving a completely drugless life a chance.  Good luck to you all.""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I am finishing up my final month on Claravis, the first two months I have to say were the worst. I broke out so bad that every time I smiled I felt nothing but throbbing pain all over my face. Now my face has started to clear but slowly. I have dark spots, and redness all over my face plus some blackheads to go along with it. I don&#039;t breakout as bad as I did back in month 2. Hopefully I will be able to see a clear future. """,4
Adderall,ADHD,"""I was recently put on Adderall for ADD. I have suffered ever since I can remember with not being able to focus on anything, having a wandering mind, and doing very poorly in school. I began to just think school wasn&#039;t for me. I had heard many negatives on Adderall and that is why I never asked my doctor if it would be an option for me. He suggested I give it a try and now I am on 10 mg every day/as needed and I feel better than I have in years. It has helped my depression/anxiety as well. I am happy to learn now and attend school. Wonderful drug for me.""",1
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""Take 30 mg/day, helped mildly with my GAD. Did nothing for my social anxiety. I continue to take it because it has no side effects and am told it will help with anxiety I may get from taking Wellbutrim. I have to take Xanax or Clonazepam regularly when having moderate/severe anxiety. Only side effects experienced in the first few days was dizziness and insomnia. I was able to increase my dose within 2 weeks. I am considering increasing my dose of Buspar to see if I just need a higher dose to feel a stronger effect.""",7
Vicoprofen,Pain,"""I am 32 yrs old and have had severe chronic daily migraines/ herniated disc with lots of head and back pain ever since I was 16 yrs old. I also have a tumor on my spinal cord that causes pain as well. I&#039;ve been on every pain medicine that&#039;s out there. My doc switched me to Vicoprofen 10mg 4x day due to it not having Tylenol in it. I&#039;ve been on it for 2/3 months and it&#039;s working just fine. Due to me/my body having a high tolerance level because of taking pain medicines, mostly Lortab 10&#039;s for many yrs, the only thing I worry about is building up a tolerance to this as well. I can take on an empty stomach or full. I&#039;m just thankful for the FDA coming out with this to help save my liver. Hope this helps others!""",9
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I am 52 years old... have an extreme pain in my knee that had limited my exercise a lot..... additionally some emotional reasons that made me gain 20 pounds in the last year and I was already 10 pounds over
Today is my day five the only side effect is constipation.
Medication for me is being fantastic... I always read how to lose wieght in the past but never was able to practice.  Now I am eating to live in the last 5 days and not living to eat
Medication left me more calm in general... doing things in my time including eating and exercise.... very hopeful I will lose the weigh I need""",3
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""Actually came out of hospital, because I have been suffering from long term insomnia and was prescribed Belsomra 15mg as a &#039;last resort&#039; option. In my experiences I have already tried Temazepam, Valpam, Valium, Imovane, Seroquel (quetiapine) etc. All those drugs eventually just building up my tolerance each time and I become dependent on them to sleep. 

I however did try the antidepressant Valdoxan 25mg (Agomelatine). THIS REALLY HELPED ME FOR  MONTH. My body really built up tolerance to it and eventually I needed 50mg and then it just stopped working for me after 5 months, but I can assure you it reallllllly helped my insomnia for that short 5 months. *Will CONTINUE IN ANOTHER POST*""",0
Voltaren Gel,Pain,"""I have been having severe back and neck pain for years and was taking ibuprofen 24 hours a day. My doctor told me that was very bad for my stomach and to use the Voltaren Gel instead and I found it to be wonderful, comfortable and it smells nice. Two days after I started using the Voltaren Gel I was so much more comfortable and now I alternate the ibuprofen 200 with the Gel and only use the Ibuprofen 200 two times a day. I can sleep a whole night. My back condition is in the muscles and and they are in spasm much of the time. Voltaren calms the spasms down and makes the pain tolerable. I am so glad to have found it.""",9
Bactrim,Acne,"""I&#039;m 27 &amp; struggle with hormonal cystic acne. I have been on this medication for about 3 months now. Prior to Bactrim, I was taking minocycline. Minocycline worked great but I developed a resistance to it in July 2013. From July 2013 I tried doxycycline, then erythromycin. I struggled trying to find a solution with my Kaiser dermatologist until I went to another dermatologist in June 2014. June 2014, I tried Bactrim &amp; it started clearing up my skin 3 days after using it. I was prescribed to take 1 pill twice daily. I take 1 in the morning &amp; 1 at night. This medicine has saved me from depression, feeling dirty &amp; ugly. I hope I don&#039;t develop a resistance to it. My skin is completely clear.""",4
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""This Brand takes longer to work, and way longer to wear off. I have used this brand for 4 months with no choice really... This brand made me feel like I was coming off of anesthesia the next day. I felt foggy &amp; depressed. Never feeling refreshed. I think the brand is dangerous and should be investigated. Currently I&#039;m back on Northstar, with my initial preference being (for generic) TEVA. Otherwise the brand itself, &quot;Ambien&quot; is a much more gentle medication, being my #1 preference.

You should know the quality standards of a generic medication, the FDA requires the bioequivalence of a generic drug to be between 80% and 125% of the innovator product. That as well as the encapsulation of med can make all the difference! Per FDA""",0
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;m a poster child for this drug. I had severe insomnia in my early 30s (i.e., NO sleep for three nights running without a sleeping aid), and various Rxs were of little help. I started out on 150 mg. and in the early part of the many years I&#039;ve been taking it I whittled it down to 12.5 mg, a quarter of a 50 mg pill. A ridiculously small amount, but I&#039;ve tested it and know it&#039;s not a placebo. It works perfectly for me%u2014I&#039;m drowsy within 10 minutes of taking, sleep through the night, and I&#039;m never fuzzy in the morning. Highly recommend.""",0
Dexedrine,ADHD,"""Great medicine, I recently restarted this medicine after 10 years and I feel normal again. This medicine has given me great peace in my life. 

I feel calm and collected and I&#039;m quickly understanding what its like to have &quot;free time&quot; 

I insist that people who find results using this medicine ensure those in government understand the increase in quality of life we are all experiencing. I&#039;ve rated this medicine 10/10 purely because any cons I&#039;ve experienced are meaningless compared to been given a life.""",1
Methadone,Pain,"""I had a very severe electrical accident and got locked up to 480 for minutes from what I told. I don&#039;t remember much about it. about three years ago. I have had skin grafting to several parts of my body, surgery on both hips, it fried my nerves completely and have migraine or headaches everyday. I have tried all the the pain meds...I mean all. Eventually I was sent to a pain management clinic where my Dr wanted to immediately put me on methadone. It shocked me that he automatically went to methadone and I only thought that it was for the heroine withdrawal and I was against it 100%. We tried several meds before having to revisit going on methadone. Come to find out it total saved my life!! If your in chronic pain try it YOU WILL BE SURPRISED""",9
Azelaic acid,Acne,"""I had super bad acne for about half a year and it was awful. My dermatologist, at first put me on creams like Aczone and Epiduo and an antibiotic called Doxycycline Monohydrate. My skin started to look better.The dermat switched my antibiotic to a different drug called minocycline. This cleared up my face, but started making some of my acne scars look even darker! I then switched back to my normal, until last December I began having a major allergic reaction to the Epiduo. It was awful! I stopped using it and continued with the pill and with the Aczone.  I started to break out again, and I&#039;m hoping that starting Finacea, it will keep me acne free again!""",4
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""Am on a cross-over from Venlafaxine to Mirtazipine due to the libido-destroying qualities I experienced with the former. If ever there was a passion killer list then Venlafaxine would rate up there with halitosis.  It is  great anti-depressant but top of the flops in the pants department.
Started on 30mgs Mirtazipine the other day and two things hit me straight away..... food and serenity.
Will keep it going as am sure the initial &#039;hit&#039; will subside and I&#039;ll rejoin my body sometime but certainly if the libido matches the serenity then &#039;hello baby!&#039;""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I developed acne at about 11 years old.  It wasnt bad, but it got worse.  At about 12-13 years old, it hit hard and got really bad.  I tried everything you could possibly think of.  You say it, I&#039;ve tried it.  But nothing at all worked.  I tried things as little as home remedies to expensive dermatologist cleansers that cost over $100 a bottle.  Still, nothing worked.  For a while I nearly gave up hope, I was so insecure about my skin I wouldn&#039;t even dare to leave the house, let alone my room, without makeup on.  I found makeup was like my security blanket in a way.  I discovered Accutane and let me tell you, it is THE best thing I have ever tried. My acne is gone and 
I&#039;m 15 now. I couldn&#039;t be more happier.  I believe Accutane is a cure.""",4
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Lamictal for approximately a month now for bipolar 1, slowly working up to what I am now at 100mg. I have noticed a dramatic drop in depression but hypo mania only slightly changed, I think it only feels like it has worsened because the depression isn&#039;t there to bring me back down, I still can&#039;t sleep at night, I still panic, feel the doom of anxiety, and racing thoughts among other things. I have had an incredibly increased libido, overall I can&#039;t believe how well its working in such a short time without the terrible side effects that other medications can give you. I&#039;m a mom of 4, I have no time to be a zombie, confused, tired and slow, I look forward to seeing the next few months.""",6
Concerta,ADHD,"""I am an 18 year old male. While I was in school I struggled with subjects that involve high levels of focus to succeed in e.g. Math, Chem, Physics, English (all of the important ones). In grade 12 I decided to try Concerta after a bad experience with Ritalin (night terrors). I only take it on days I will need it which I think makes you not need to go up in dosage. It worked so well it is hard to explain what happens exactly but it just makes you focus and understand what the teacher is talking about. My marks instantly went up. The only side affects I get is I feel warm and sometimes if I take it to late in the day I have trouble falling asleep. This medicine is a miracle, I wish I had it earlier on in school because it helps so much.""",1
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I am a female senior and started taking this drug about 8 months ago, so far it works well for the depression at 150mg.   I missed taking the drug for 2 days and as a result I had terrible symptoms when I went to bed, my muscles felt like they were tensed and shaking, could not go to sleep but must have at some point and had terrible dreams, now I feel quite ill, stomach upset, gut upset,  sweating, horrible.  Had to take some pepto bismol tabs to try to settle my stomach.  Took my pill at lunch today, waiting to see if I start to feel better.  Surely there must be a drug that can do the same job without the necessity to take it with food and won&#039;t send you body into a tizzy if you miss a dose or 2.""",5
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I started taking it today and have seen a dramatic difference in cravings...they are non existent..I can&#039;t even finish my meals because I have no urge too. I see with this medication I am going to have to make myself eat. The energy boost it a major plus and because the energy boost is so strong in the morning I am going to change to morning workout for the duration of this medication. I previously lose 60  on my own but the doctor said I needed it to come off quicker. I&#039;m 5,5 , 255 lbs...will be updating regularly..""",2
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Terrible gettin to sleep and stayin sleep. 1st tried Melatonin, Did nothing. Was prescribed Ambien, helped me get to sleep but didn&#039;t help me stay asleep thru night. Was switch to AmbienCR12.5mg, Did exactly what I needed, helped me fall sleep and stay sleep, felt much better on those days that I needed it. Couple years ago dr told me they changed rules for Ambien for women cause all these people had weird reactions. Me- no issues with full 12.5mg. Highly upsets me, I was doing great on the reg dose. Was prescribed lower dose next refill, only lasted 3-4hrs sleep, def not good :( They should start a person off on the low dose, wean u up on individual basis, for proper treatment! As no 2 pts r alike, &amp; each needs diff doses to work for them""",0
Amphetamine,ADHD,"""18 year old college female. I&#039;ve been medicated for 4 years now and tried concerta (which was hell) and Vyvanse (the devils drug). Evekeo was amazing at first kind of similar to Vyvanse and then it went downhill. Whereas on Vyvanse I just wouldn&#039;t eat and was depressed and spacey, this one didn&#039;t have side effects like that. But after awhile it made me incredibly mean, and didn&#039;t seem to take away the verbal impulse side of the hyperactivity. I&#039;m normally an incredibly happy person but when I&#039;m on this medicine I&#039;m a bitch to whoever over whatever for no reason at all. It did help with the focusing though.""",1
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I have been on Venlafaxine for 10 years now and couldn&#039;t be happier. I see all the negative comments on here but you need to remember that these reviews are our experiences, how our bodies reacted, your body may react different. How many times have you changed meds in order to find the right one? It&#039;s no different with this one, well maybe a little because you need to lower your dosage slowly or you will get violently ill. I didn&#039;t refill my prescription in time and I was so miserable I had to go to the ER. I gained weight on Paxil but not on Effexor but some people do. Take all these reviews, evaluate, make a list of questions for your doctor and then decide if you want to give it a try.""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I have mixed feelings on Ritalin I am 16 years old Diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome and ADD. I started taking 20mg in the morning, After about 10 minutes I would start feeling it, i felt full of energy and moderately euphoric. I don&#039;t know if this is a &quot;Normal&quot; reaction but it would make me feel almost manic like. But all in all the effects were  helpful! When I would usually just sit on my computer the Ritalin somehow made work enjoyable. I hated math but when on Ritalin and in school it was interesting even fun! it made everything feel positive and perfect. The reason I don&#039;t give it a 10 is because it only lasts for 3-4 hours. The comedown from this drug is quite terrible. And it gave me some annoying tics.""",1
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""The only real way to see if medication works is to ask the people you live with. I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for over a month and have had no side effects. My family can testify that I am a so much more calmer and less reactive. In fact my 18 year old daughter happened to be with me when I went to the doctor and he asked how I was going. My daughter replied for me and told him, &quot;I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s all in her head, but she is amazing now. She used to be so irritable and grumpy. Now she&#039;s really nice.&quot;  How&#039;s that for honesty? Like they say, &quot;Out of the mouth of babes!&quot; I really, really do feel happier and it&#039;s great knowing my family can see the difference. I remember saying to my doctor &quot;I&#039;m not coping&quot;, but I truly don&#039;t feel that way anymore.""",7
Nucynta,Pain,"""I&#039;m not sure why this medication is considered a schedule II &#039;narcotic&#039;. Perhaps having been prescribed Oxycodone, Hydromorphone, and Fentanil in the past is a factor in forming this opinion, but I have been fortunate enough to find a specialist willing to treat fibromyalgia-related pain with Nucynta.

This medication does not give me any of the usual negative opioid side effects, nor the weird SSRI/SNRI type mental side effects of Tramadol. Nausea is rare and possibly unrelated, no itching, or lack of mental clarity. I can see why it would be inadequate for post-surgical or trauma-induced pain but it works perfectly for my current state of managing physical therapy after a long period of inactivity.""",9
Belviq,Obesity,"""I started Bleviq and did get headaches and fatique the first week, then it went away. I sleep so good when I take it at night and not tired anymore with my first dose in a.m. and have lost 16 pounds with drinking a lot of water and watching what I eat. I love this pill -I would never take anything for weight loss but I will stay on this one to my goal I was 192 lbs 5&#039;1&quot; on May 9th and down to 173 on June 13th""",2
Diphenhydramine,Insomnia,"""My doctor had prescribed Ambien.  Before taking it, I wanted to know side-effects.  Found that it can have very negative unwanted side-effects.  Therefore, did NOT even take one tablet.  Threw them out!  So, I turned to the Equate Nighttime Sleep aid, 50mg., which was a good choice.  Help me to sleep well.  I do, though, awake although briefly around 2:30-3:00 AM after having gong to bed at 9:00 PM.  Notice some daytime sleepiness at times.""",0
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had such a horrible experience with this birth control. My anxiety has really spiked as well as depression. I cry for little things and my emotions are all over the place. My face is turning into this blob of break outs that I can&#039;t even get control with facial treatments. I have been on my period for months until I was given a birth control pill to regulate it. It has suddenly stopped working as effectively as before and I am spotting every other day. I don&#039;t even feel comfortable in my own skin anymore. I really liked the idea of the implant, it was an option that I thought was convenient to me and less risky like missing a pill or the condom breaking (like it did before), however, I am starting to feel that the cons outweigh pros.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""My doctor prescribed me with phentermine 37.5mg. I&#039;ve recently just started the medicine yesterday on 10/25/2017 and so far I have jitters, a little dry mouth, I&#039;m full of energy, and I have no appetite! The good thing is I feel like I can run a marathon race. I drink plenty of water a day and portion my food intake. I plan on eating healthier and working out daily. My starting weight is 265lb. I plan on going back to my college weight which was 188lb. I&#039;m excited for this journey and to keep you guys updated.""",3
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. I have been on Lexapro about 4 different times. I never learn my lesson.  After 6 months or so I think I am doing good enough to wean myself off and within 6 months I am back in the ER with a severe panic attack. I should just stay on it. This time around I started on 5mg and then bumped it to 10mg after 3 days. I am on day 2 of 10mg. I finally feel some relief. I have not left my house in a week- trapped due to panic attacks and today I was able to walks dogs and go to the store. Thank God there is something like Lexapro out there or else I would surely be in a mental institution.""",7
Accutane,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had very bad back and butt acne for 14 years.I have always put off taking accutane as I heard of the horrible side effects. I went to the doctor for a bad spot of acne that needed to be cut open. He said I have to go on accutane and explained the side effects. Lets do it cause I can&#039;t carry on like this any more.The pain ,the bleeding and the fact I haven&#039;t taken my shirt off in public for 14 years. I was very worried about taking it. Started in December 2016. I&#039;ve been on it for 4 months already and its made a huge difference to my back and butt. My butt is taking a bit longer and that was explained to me before taking it. I have had very little break out on my back and its almost cleared. thou I have dry skin and very dry lips so far but worth it.""",4
Bupropion,Depression,"""I was prescribed Wellbutrin XR (150mg) for slight depression, stress and anxiety. After taking Celexa which didn&#039;t really help I wanted to try something that I thought would be &quot;stronger&quot;. Wellbutrin did absolutely nothing for me. We upped the dose to 300mg which made no difference I was on it for about 3 months before I stopped, I was also hoping it would help me lose some weight. No Luck.""",5
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""Any drug can get a bad wrap because of some people abusing it. A lot of doctors don&#039;t even like prescribing Xanax because they don&#039;t want their patients getting &quot;hooked&quot;. For me, I suffer from occasional anxiety attacks, and my prescription is &quot;as needed&quot;. Anxiety attacks can be VERY scary. There were a few times I literally thought I was gonna die, it was that bad. I even went to the ER once because I believed I was having a heart attack. They are different for different people. I use to smoke and drink a lot of coffee, so I think that&#039;s what screwed up my body chemistry. I don&#039;t drink caffeine or smoke anymore. All I know is that now that I have my Alprazolam (Xanax) in my pocket, I&#039;m not as scared to go places. I can live my life again.""",7
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I was given a starter pack of a month long supply of Strattera from my Psychiatrist. I&#039;m currently about two weeks in (starts you at 20mg and ends at 80mg) and the reason I am giving the drug this rating is due to me being unsure about how it&#039;s affected me thus far. When I first started to take it my anxiety subsided and I felt normal and back on track again. This lasted for the first week. I was even able to travel alone to be with my fianc&eacute; in Mexico. I&#039;ve never traveled much, let alone by myself. I did this with ease. Now back from my trip and having increased the dosage to I believe 60 or 80 right now, I don&#039;t feel the same. Sadly. :-( I&#039;m disheartened because I thought this was my cure all after a terrible winter.""",1
Skyla,Birth Control,"""My experience was absolutely horrible. Birth control works different for everyone but this was by far the worst pain I&#039;ve ever been in. Immediately after inserted I was in excruciating pain. I started having heat waves and extreme cramping. This lasted for weeks. I had an ultrasound done to see if it was causing any ovarian cysts, or if the iud wasn&#039;t inserted correctly and my ultrasounds came back normal. A week later I had to have it removed (after a month) because of how much pain I was in. I would highly recommend not having this at all, because of how severe my pain was. I had to take pain killers every 2 to 3 hours, and I would wake up in the middle of the night because of how much pain I was in. Absolutely terrible!""",8
Sertraline,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Zoloft (generic) for about three months.  I noticed an immediate difference in the way I felt. I began taking it for mild anxiety/depression.  I am now starting to feel more depressed and empty again, like my body is becoming immune to it.  I don&#039;t want to switch because I don&#039;t want to go through another medication.  Zoloft though in general has helped incredibly within the last three months -- my boyfriend and I don&#039;t fight, I don&#039;t get snappy on people, and I feel so much better about going out and doing things. I am more productive now than I ever was. I just don&#039;t want my body to become used to it because I love the way it felt to feel okay.""",5
Pristiq,Depression,"""I have had severe depression  for about 1 year now. My psychiatrist and I have tried just about all SSRI&#039;s/anti-depressants (Prozac, Paxil, Effexor, Abilify, Deplin, Cymbalta). I started Pristiq ER about 4 months ago. WOW!I felt about 50% better in 3-4 weeks, than I had in several months. At my follow-up appointment I asked my Doctor to increase my dose and he did. I now take 100mg daily. Although my depression has plateaued, I&#039;m not AS depressed as I WAS. Suicidal thoughts, and worthlessness are a lot less. I also have very few side effects. I&#039;ve lost about 15lbs while on it. So if you are truly desperate I would recommend you try this one next.""",5
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""My son suffered 3 concussions back to back which left him in a zombie like state for several (7) years. He was not sad, per se, just in a state of chronic malaise coupled with chronic fatigue, i.e. not being able to stay awake more then 2 or 3 hours at a time. Finally, we were able to find a Doctor who was familiar with head injuries and the low level of dopamine that the victim is often left with. Wellbutrin is a dopamine and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor so it is really working great for our son. It was literally like flicking his switch back &quot;on&quot;.  Anyone who has not felt like their old self after even a minor concussion should consider using this medicine.""",5
Strattera,ADHD,"""Nothing would quite fix me. Not antidepressants, or therapy or Adderall.  Depressed all the time, screaming on the inside.  Had days I literally could not do anything. Unfocused at work, hated my job, life and wife.  Changed psych doctors, prescribed Strattera, titrated more slowly than sample pack, got up to 60 mg. Way happier. Less sensitive - don&#039;t get hurt easily. Take criticism better. Wife notices big difference in mood- always thought it was depression.  It&#039;s ADD and Strattera is perfect for it.  Just hope it keeps working!""",1
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was very hesitant to start taking this medicine.  I have tried so many different kinds before and they had done more damage than good.  I read a lot of the reviews on here and after serious thought I decided to try it.  I&#039;m so very happy I did.  I&#039;m about two weeks in and I believe I have found the correct mix.  I&#039;m so happy, and excited!  It&#039;s almost hard to believe.  If anyone is on the fence about this I would recommend taking it.  If you trust your psych doc, I would assume you do then go for it.  I was told you can tell the next day if you should stop taking it.  I have Bipolar 1 disorder and I also take Wellbutrin XL 150mg 3 x a day. Klonopin 4 x a day and now Saphris 5 mg at night.  I love it!""",6
Tapentadol,Pain,"""Nucynta worked very well for my back and hip pain. Was only on the medication for a month, had to stop the medication because I could not use my hormone patch. Having menopause symptoms was almost as bad as the pain itself. I would recommend discussing menopause medications with your doctor prior to using Nucynta because one month without hormones is horrible on a marriage and customer service work.""",9
Neurontin,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been on Neurotin for almost 4 months and it has given me relief for chronic pelvic pain. 300mg at night and 100mg mid-day was the initial dose and at present I&#039;m on 300mg at night only.  It has made the pain bearable however the side-effects have been lethargy, headaches, aching eyes, and dreaming so vivid it leaves me hung over. I&#039;m hoping this will improve with time. It has helped with the pain.""",9
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed this for onset of anxiety and possible hormonal mood swings. I was not told by my doctor how it would make me feel or how hard coming off of it would be. I took one 37.5 mg capsule and was horrified that I was given this. I woke up at 2am with an anxiety attack for about the first hour. It then went into being wired, nauseous, shakey, weak, chills and sweating. 11 years ago I quit using meth and this was awful that I felt like I was on it again. I laid in bed the entire day, wide awake and ill. I never took another dose! And even one pill took at least another full day to leave my system. My nervous system is obviously sensitive and I could not handle this medication at all.""",7
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Aj - 5&#039;8 - 283LBS
After 4 yrs of obesity, 3 of them during my ex&#039;s (children&#039;s father) horrendous battle w/cancer &amp; recent death, here I am.  My family doctor was witness to this emotional journey and my physical decline with weight gain, extreme fatigue and body aches. I had a recent checkup and learned my bloodwork and specialist appt were all clear. I mentioned to Dr. A that I finally feel like I am seeing myself again and wish I could get my body to match my level of happiness and will to do more. He talked to me about Phentermine. After some thought I started on 8/5/17, one 30mg pill daily. Today I am -10lbs! No side effects and sleep well! I &quot;plan&quot; healthy snacks as my appetite is very low. Energy level is up but not crazy.""",2
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""After 15 years of incorrect medication, the last 2 being a roulette of 12 different meds, my life is amazing. I take 175 mg plus a 159 mg Wellbutrin kicker. These coupled with 900 mg of Li each night (and 100 mg trazadone), I am allowed to be the wife, mother and teacher I knew I could be. I was an extremely rapid cycling Bipolar 2 (even daily swings) and for almost a year now, I am a normal person.  I will also stress that CBT is just as important as the meds.  Many people on this site having negative effects are on really high doses -maybe this is the problem? I get many side effects from all meds and now they are minor. (FYI, Lamo works with the neurotransmitter glutamate and not sere, norep, or dope - BP is not depression)""",6
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""I took Cymbalta (20mg twice per day) for about a year. The drug worked better than any other AD I tried. Around 10 months ago, I wanted to see if I could come off the drug to see how I would do. I suffered from anxiety and mild depression. Once the drug was weaned out of my system, I haven&#039;t felt quite right. My doctor agreed for me to start taking it again. After three weeks, I have a much better state of mind with decreased anxiety. I really like this medication and have no side effects!""",7
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""I would rate this 10 if it worked all night. I take the generic Zaleplon. It will make me drowsy in about 30 minutes and I will fall asleep; usually with the TV on a timer. I used to take Xanax and a few cocktails, but wanted something different. I wake up about 4-5 hours later and sometimes get back to sleep sporadically; sometimes not. Now, I take 2.5mg Xanax, then 30 min later take the Zaleplon and shortly after another 2.5mg Xanax (I half one 5mg Xanax and take separately). I still wake up earlier than I want to, but I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s anything I can do about that until I relieve some stress.""",0
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I have used Alli and was very happy.  It absolutely will help you lose weight. If you are planning on not adjusting your diet, it is not for you.  Since it inhibits fat from being absorbed, fat goes right through you and could definitely be embarrassing (if you know what I mean).  If you lower the fat in your diet, it will do wonders and the disgusting side effects will be minimal to non-existent.""",2
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""15mg was too stimulating (actually made me feel jittery) but 7.5 did help me fall asleep faster and sleep longer.  Stopped working at all after a few months so I&#039;m tapering off.  I did not experience any increase in appetite, though I did gain a few pounds (which I was able to lose while on the Mirt.).  Side effects were tolerable:  dry mouth, slight headache.  I confess that I&#039;m jealous that so many people find this med super sedating - it just didn&#039;t work that way for me!""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started phentermine on February 13th. I started at 230lbs and now weigh 204lbs. This pill is a miracle for me. I&#039;ve had six children and the last was a c-section and at 28yrs old I just couldn&#039;t lose the weight. My goal is to get to 150lbs, what I weighed before all the children. A note to everyone the pill won&#039;t do it all by itself. At some point you will need to exercise and start watching what you eat. After the first day I&#039;ve had no side effects except for dry mouth.""",3
Benzaclin,Acne,"""I have never wrote a review on a product before but I had to share my experience with this one because it&#039;s soooo good. I had really bad acne on my forehead that didn&#039;t wanna go away no matter what I used and finally I went to the doctor and he prescribed me Benzaclin. I used this a week straight and my skin was so much better. After 3 weeks all my acne was gone basically! The only thing that sucks is that if I stop using it a couple of weeks later my acne gets really bad again so u have to keep using it""",4
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""This works!  I took a break, but am taking it again.  I am a 38 yr old female and started at 222 lbs and am 5&#039;7 size 16.  In 6 month time I had lost 32 lbs size 12.  It calmed my cravings, I even stopped drinking wine.  I stopped taking for 4 months gained 10 lbs back...I&#039;ve been back on it for about 2 weeks and have lost 5 to 6 lbs ....the weight gain was my own fault and I stopped taking this over the holidays.""",3
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I have struggled with Acne since puberty. I started using Atralin in my 40&#039;s. This has been the only product to ever get my acne under control. So nice to be free from worry. Go to the beach, work out, wear no make up sometimes! I wish this was around when I was younger and perhaps would of avoided so much scaring. For me my scars are really all over except my face so I did luck out with that. Also it makes skin smoother and skin look younger. Cost has gone now which is a plus ,used to be very expensive when it first came out. If I stop it acne always comes back. So I have to use it every night. I combine it with another acne lotion from my dermatologist. I have light sensitive skin and it does not irritate it like other products.""",4
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I am a 27 year old male, on this drug for 3 weeks so I can&#039;t really comment on it&#039;s efficacy, as it takes 2-4 weeks to start working. All I can say is it didn&#039;t help me. I took 40mg for 7 days, then went up to 80mg for 2 weeks. I had to stop taking it because of the side effects - I was getting severe irritability to the point where I was yelling at the top of my lungs at people for minor mistakes and generally grumpy. Based on this and other side effects - needing to urinate far more regularly than usual, heart palpitations, feeling down for no good reason and insomnia - my doctor decided it wasn&#039;t right for me.This is a rare reaction which is unlikely to happen to you, but if you get it, tell your doctor.""",1
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medicine has been amazingly helpful. After being misdiagnosed with depression I began taking this once my bipolar symptoms were diagnosed correctly. For those of you who may not think the drug works, I wonder if your doctor is doing a blood test to determine if your dosage meets the therapeutic level. Also, I learned the hard way that birth control pills totally negate the effect of Lamictal. It took a while to straighten that one out. Thanks to all for writing in.""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""My experience:
Cons- some nights, right as soon as I fell asleep, I&#039;d wake up sleep walking and make myself something to eat, or get naked and sit at the table. Now I&#039;m not a sleep walker but my brother sleeps late and he would always tell me in the morning that I&#039;d walk into his room and say something random or he&#039;d be in the kitchen when I wake up sleepwalking. He&#039;d say I always seemed fully awake cause my eyes were wide open but I&#039;d act weird.
Pro&#039;s- Kept me asleep and I&#039;d wake up early feeling I had enough sleep.""",0
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I absolutely love Nexplanon. After just two months on it, I stopped having my period and haven&#039;t noticed any changes with my body. I haven&#039;t gained any weight, no cramping, and no worries about taking a pill at the same time everyday! I think it worked so well because I was on the pill for 3 years prior so my body is used to hormones and regular cycles. Not that the pill was terrible but I am never going back!""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""Contrave had the opposite intended effect on me. I had been dieting and exercising with no help and lost 70 lbs, my appetite was down and I had not cheated for months. Then my doctor pleased with my success decided to prescribe me Contrave to give me that extra little push. This was a mistake, I already had a suppressed appetite due to a strict diet that I had grown used to, within 1 week of taking Contrave I was cheating on my diet, my cravings were going through the roof. Like most people it did make me sick occasionally but that wasn&#039;t the big issue. I took Contrave for around 2 months and ended up gaining about 20 lbs. back that I had lost. It may help with starting a diet, but if you&#039;re already losing weight without it DO NOT take it.""",2
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve  had sleep disruption for many years. I took Ambien for years, now Lunesta. Gradually reduced from 3 mg to 0 mg, with zero problems.  My mind was clearer. With new severe stress &amp; sleep disruptions again, recently went back on Lunesta. Started with 1 mg, then 2 then 3. Trouble is, now still waking up after about 4 hours, then waking and sleeping throughout the next 4 hours. I also use Belleruth Naperstacks &quot;Sleep&quot;  guided imagery CD to fall asleep and her &quot;General Wellness&quot; $ &quot;Stress and Anxiety&quot; in early morning or Jon Kabat Zinn&#039;s &quot;Body Scan&quot; during those 4 hours when my sleep is intermittent. I&#039;m finding that I am sleepy and tired when I get out of bed now at 3 mg &amp; feel overly medicated, yet it isn&#039;t working well after 4 hours.""",0
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Hi, It&#039;s been 2 months I&#039;m using this cream at night with Cetogly face wash as suggested by a skin specialist whom I visited for acne. And I would say that the result is satisfactory. Doctor prescribed me some tablets as well along with this cream. I would suggest use it only if suggested by a skin specialist because we all have different skin types and different reasons for acne. Hope u understand that skin is a very sensitive &amp; important physical thing so we shouldn&#039;t do any experiment with it :)

Concerta,ADHD,"""I am 18 and I&#039;ve been on Concerta for just over a year now, and I took an extra year of high school to catch up, I went from a 60 in math to a 90, I felt like I had a whole new brain. Like others, I was a funny, outgoing, active person but I now find myself completely content with being alone, infact I prefer it. I easily become irritated by spending time with others. I&#039;ve also experienced uncontrollable mood swings, and I spend a lot of time crying. Lately, I&#039;ve been losing focus though regardless and my dosage is already at 54mg. I&#039;m so happy with my grades, and in the beginning I was myself, but in the past few months I&#039;ve become a machine, and all I think about is how much work I need to do.""",1
Meperidine,Pain,"""As Percocet was not helping my back pain anymore my Doctor switched me to Demerol 100mg. Now my back pain is once again under control and I am only taking two pills a day instead of 6-8 Percocets. I have had no negative side effects as of yet. This is by far the most relief I&#039;ve had in years. I&#039;ve been on Vicodin, Percocet, MS Contin, naproxen, Norco 10mg and I&#039;ve never had total relief until now. """,9
Wellbutrin,Anxiety,"""Have only been taking for three days. Have some headaches, nausea, no big deal. I don&#039;t like the feeling after my second dose at night. I have gotten panicky and felt like I was going to have a panic attack, but have not so far. I am mainly using this to quit smoking and I see that it is triggering my anxiety somewhat, but I have already lost the urge to smoke and will quit on my quit date. I would rather deal with side effects for a couple weeks than die of lung cancer and leave my children with no mother. Especially after losing my mother at a young age and my grandfather. I am hoping this will help my depression and anxiety after I am used to it. I can&#039;t wait to be smoke-free soon.""",7
Remeron,Insomnia,"""I suffered from insomnia for over 10 years. I tried everything under the sun from behavioral modification to herbal supplements to prescription drugs. I started 7.5 mg of Remeron and 7.5 mg of Restoril 5 months ago and I have never slept better. I am so thankful to have found these medications. The first few days I was a bit dizzy and disoriented. And, yes, I have the 10 lb weight gain but that is slowly coming off with proper diet and exercise. This medication literally saved my life.""",0
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I am a 19 year old male prescribed to a 0.5mg dosage of Xanax to be taken twice daily. Depending on my spouts of anxiety or an occasional panic attack, I either take one or a half of one to calm my state of mind. I try to just take a half of one because this medication can be addicting. I noticed these effects and feelings right after my first intake. It does indeed help suppress my anxiety and panic attacks. Due to the addiction prone aspects I&#039;m giving it an 8.""",7
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""My story is really long and complicated. I was originally on Xanax and all it did was make me sleep. Switched doctors because my original doctor wouldn&#039;t switch me off the Xanax. New doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I was upset at first because I didn&#039;t feel I needed it, I thought Lexapro was an anti-depressant and I wasn&#039;t depressed.. About a month after I started taking the Lexapro I felt amazing! But then I lost my health insurance so they put me on Paxil. I miss my Lexapro! It was the best.""",7
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""Not perfect but pretty close. Switched from Paxil(no emotions)-&gt; Wellbutrin(aka severe anorexia)-&gt;Effexor. Basically all medications were pretty decent at anxiety coverage. I found Paxil to be the best without thinking of anything but anxiety attacks. Wellbutrin to be the least effective. Effexor was somewhere in the middle while still letting me enjoy life with an occasional anxiety attack. Since I&#039;ve been on Effexor I&#039;ve had maybe 3-4 small anxiety attacks in the span of 2-3 years.""",7
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have tried just about every Bipolar Medicine there is out there and then some.   I am completely satisfied with this medicine.  All of the others had terrible side effects.  Neurontin, Zyprexa, Lithium, Tegretol, you name it I&#039;ve tried it.  It is very hard to get someone who is bipolar to take medicines due to the fact there are so many side effects.  In my opinion Abilify does what is says it supposed to do with no side effects.  Of course everyone is different.  This medicine works.  It keeps me from going high or low.  Most bipolar patients should probably be on an antidepressant, which is only my opinion since everyone is unique.""",6
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I started Contrave on September 17 and as of this morning, I&#039;m down 15 lbs. I also joined Weight Watchers on line to keep track of my calories and exercise. The only side effects I have is dry mouth, which just requires me to drink more water which is a good thing, and some constipation, but I just increased my fiber, water intake and used a stool softener and was back to normal within 4 days. My doctor wanted to put me on Lipitor because of my high cholesterol. I asked her to let me try to lose weight first. So, to me the $90 is worth it so that I can avoid any type of prescriptions.""",3
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""Psych prescribed Venlafaxine, Neulactil + Mirtazapine (have been on Mirtazapine for 2 years). So far taking Venlafaxine I am energetic, I am thinking clearly, feel more confident &amp; I am not emotional at all. I also noticed my appetite has reduced severely (I gained 16kgs on Mirtazapine). 5 days in I still have very minimal appetite, I am finding that I have a day where I am energetic and days where I am not. I often get a bit of euphoria but I am so far pleased with everything. I expect I will up the dosage eventually. Suicidal thoughts have been minimal but they&#039;re occur sporadically. I also have moments where I zone out but this may be because I am still getting used to the medication.""",7
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been on Strattera since 3rd grade. And I don&#039;t understand why so many people are against it. I have only experienced good results with this drug. My grades have increased, I am able to focus in class, and I can excel and prosper. My doctor has told me that eventually I will be weaned off of Strattera because my brain should be able to adapt. All I can say is. I never experienced any horrible side effects, if any. I can&#039;t say I remember any side effects. And I know that it is not addictive since I am able to stop taking the drug during the summer time. I&#039;ve had a moderately positive experience on Strattera. I hope everyone else does too.""",1
Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medicine works really well as a mood stabilizer for me. The only MAJOR drawback is weight gain. I just can&#039;t control myself when the carb cravings happen. I am usually very much in control of my dietary habits, but on Zyprexa that just isn&#039;t possible. I also suffer from schizoaffective disorder and hear voices. Although Zyprexa suppresses them, it does not completely get rid of them in my case; they are quiet enough to tolerate though. I have gained 35 pounds in less than about a month and a half. I am going to wean off of these and ask the psych-doc for something else.""",6
Trintellix,Depression,"""In the beginning I only had a problem with itching, I kept thinking my body would get used to it &amp; it would stop.  It didn&#039;t, it only got worse. I wasn&#039;t experiencing any other severe issues, so I had planned to stay on it, but on Day 7, I noticed that I was having trouble finding my words, my vocabulary was impaired &amp; there was almost a stutter present. On Day 8 I became very nauseous &amp; decided that would be my last day. The side effects were just too much to wait it out.  Day 9, no med, my husband told me that I seemed much more relaxed and &quot;involved&quot;. I cannot wait for this itching to go completely away!
I did seem to have a little more positive attitude &amp; motivation but the side effects were too much!""",5
Seroquel,Depression,"""I recently started Seroquel 50 MG for depression, panic disorder, anxiety, insomnia. The first couple of days and then up to 150 MG. This medication works great. It creates anxiolytic effects similar to clonazapam and relieves all my anxiety. I Sleep well to. I can actually function thanks to this medication and it works excellently for paranoia and anxiety. I&#039;ve also found it to work great for sleep. I was previously on Abilify which was very activating and gave me a lot of anxiety and I couldn&#039;t sleep more than 1-2 hours. On Seroquel I sleep a full 8 hours and I wake up refreshed and ready for the day. It controls my anxiety and works wonders. Side effects are: No sex drive, and Drowsiness. Great medicine, works great.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Started 12 days ago at 231lbs., I have lost 11 lbs. No exercise, no cravings...its great! I take the pill 37.5 mg at 7 a,m so I sleep at night with no problems. I wish I would have tried this sooner rather than trying so many fad diets, wasting time. I feel in control of my eating for the first time in years, no more hitting the drive through on the way to &amp; from work each day. Bonus...I have extra cash now that I am not going out all the time buying junk &amp; snacks all day.""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started this medication after switching from quetiapine for Bipolar 2.  I have so much more energy on this medication, I have lost weight and it has levelled out my mood considerably (my usual mood state is low, but I do cycle a couple of times a year).  During initial titration I had trouble sleeping, dry mouth and digestive bleeding.  But these have lessened over time and I use laxatives and synthetic saliva to ease the side effects.  Overall I&#039;m very happy with this medication.""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have just started taking contrave and am on week two and will start week three tomorrow. So far I have gained back all the weight I lost before starting this medicine. I still eat the same foods I was eating before starting contrave. The only change I have is that when I do eat it makes my stomach feel extremely bloated after eating for about 30 minutes to 1 hour then I feel &quot;normal&quot; again. There is no boost of energy. I don&#039;t know if this is how this medication is supposed to work, but I am trying. I was hoping that for the price I would see results so far but unfortunately I am back at my uncomfortable stage again since gaining the 12 pounds I had lost already...""",2
Pristiq,Depression,"""I was diagnosed with anxiety and major depression just over a year ago. I am a 19 year old female and have a very difficult family situation. I first tried Cipralex which made me really irritable, then I tried Wellbutrin which gave me a rash. I was then on Cymbalta for 6 months, but I had many side effects and was exhausted. Within the first week on Pristiq I began to notice a huge difference, much more energy. A month later I almost feel like my old self, lots of energy, I can control my own thoughts, and I can concentrate which is amazing because I&#039;m in university. I&#039;m so glad I finally found something that works for me, and I&#039;m looking forward to more improvements over time.""",5
Tramadol,Pain,"""I was in a car wreck with whiplash. eye sensitivity, pain from mid back of head down spine to below shoulder blades, and out to both shoulders, and involving full lumbar area. Doctors put me on this stuff for the intense pain. I took it for two days, hoping it would help. OMG it double-downed my pain. I wanted to kill anyone and everyone, walls, sheets, everything that got in my way or accidently pissed me off. Called the doctor and literally growled at her about how much I hurt. I expected double pain to some extent after that kind of a shake up but this was beyond acceptable and as soon as it was out of my system I still hurt but was back under 10 on that 1 to 10 scale.""",9
Tofranil,Depression,"""I suffered from depression on and off til I was 33. My doctor prescribed a couple medicines without success. Tried Tofranil because my mother took it in the late 1950&#039;s. Noticed a gradual improvement over 1 to 4 months with the full effect over a period of about 12 months. Medicine did not work at 100mg so went up to 250mg then 200mg. Some (small price) side effects include dry mouth (Gum, tictac remedy) medicine makes you sleepy about 2 hrs after ingestion. Get ready for a good nights sleep, increased appetite and feeling more relaxed than ever before. I remember the first sign of the Tofranil working was when I went outside one day and the sun seemed so bright and I was happier to be alive. That was 25years ago. """,5
Seroquel,Insomnia,"""I have found Seroquel to be an excellent option for individuals like myself who may have formed an addiction to the regularly prescribed sleep medicines.  I have suffered with insomnia for over 30 years. On this medicine, I have experienced sleep without morning grogginess; however there have been severe muscle jerks of my legs - more severe than my regular restless leg syndrome which I have already been diagnosed.  This side effect is why the medication is not rated at a higher level.  But I would rather have the muscle jerks of my legs than to go through the drug detox process again.""",0
Duloxetine,Depression,"""Have been on a cocktail of Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Cymbalta for several years for both depression, anxiety, and chronic back pain with GREAT success. Just recently I started to notice I was becoming very short tempered, easily aggravated, and irritable. My Psych gave me .5 mg of Ativan, but also decided to wean me off my Cymbalta 60 mg. The Ativan helped me immensely. Unfortunately,within 2 weeks without my Cymbalta my depression returned, I was sleeping all the time, and worst of all I felt like I could eat everything in the kitchen and still be hungry! Gained weight so quickly,and had no ambition whatsoever. I am now on my 3rd week back on Cymbalta and feeling almost back to normal thankfully! When you find what works for you, stick with it!""",5
Strattera,ADHD,"""I&#039;m just starting the journey of the medication. I never wanted to be on meds cause I am a chef and did not want my taste buds affected. I have to say in one week I feel really hopeful, less irritable and focused and CLeAR. I can see my goals clear and am knocking things out one by one and not so stressed.  It&#039;s working as a anti depressant too. I&#039;m excited. I really am. I&#039;m reading that the journey has just began but I&#039;m going to see it though. Adderall is a mess and we use it for a buzz and to be high all night. I actually am done with those days and want to start to get my life on track. How is it with drinking? I don&#039;t drink much but since I began to be a working chef we have a ton of wine pairings. Would be nice to join in with clients""",1
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had insomnia for years until I found lunesta.  this drug is.truly lifesaving.  In the 6+ years I&#039;ve taken it, I probably only had a handful of sleepless nights. unfortunately, just this year, my insurance will no longer pay  for it.  I could get it approved and pay 90.00 a month  but I refuse to do so. I believe insurance should pay  for everything your doctor rxs for their patients.   I  was forced to try ambien.  OMG!!!  talk about a hangover with NONE of the fun.""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am 34 yrs old, 5&#039;6,  mom of 6 kids. My youngest is 7 mo old. And this is the heaviest I&#039;ve been. I started Contrave 3 weeks ago. My beginning weight was 242 and I&#039;ve lost 18 lbs in 3 wks. This has been with strict calorie restriction and walking 30 mins to an hour daily if I can. Contrave keeps my appetite in check and I forget to eat sometimes. I&#039;ve had no side effects. I&#039;m also doing the scale down program too. So far Contrave has been great! I&#039;ll update again after my 2nd month..""",2
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am a 25 yr old woman, I&#039;ve been on Vyvanse for about 1.5-2 yrs and I have had a great experience with it. I&#039;ve always been a bright student and done pretty well in school, I got by in high school but found myself struggling in college. I got diagnosed with ADHD, tried Strattera, tried Concerta to no effect. New doctor suggested Vyvanse, I started at a 30 mg, I&#039;m up to 70 mg a day but have been steady on that dose for at least a year. It has decreased my appetite, but I also started p90x not long after I started taking this drug so I&#039;m not sure which is more responsible for my weight loss. Besides that, no real side effects just helps me focus and concentrate on whatever I am supposed to be doing (and not just daydream).""",1
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""I was really worried based on some of the reviews but my Dr assured me I was a good candidate for it. So I got the Paragard today and the process was very quick with zero pain ( recently gave birth though) due to my Dr using ultrasound to make sure he placed it correctly. So far only experienced light spotting with no cramping. Only took less than a minute to place it. Right now I will give it a 10 based on experience today. So far, I feel completely normal and it&#039;s been about 10 hrs since I had it placed, but if anything changes I will be back with an update.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Had a baby 3 yrs ago. Was at my top weight of 225lbs (I&#039;m 4&#039;11&quot;). Lost 45lbs from February 08 to October 09 on Weight Watchers. Did moderate activity, but had weekly binge episodes (could not seem to control the hunger). Been tired and gaining the weight back since. My Doctor just gave me a clean bill of health, even though I&#039;m back to 210lbs and prescribed Phentermine 37.5mg. I start tomorrow... Plan to update here at 2 weeks and after my 30 day check-up. I have started walking 2x a day 5x a week and doing yoga 3 x a wk, and went back to Weight Watchers online to keep me accountable for my diet. Fingers crossed!""",3
Clonidine,ADHD,"""My 7 year old son has severe ADHD, ODD, and anxiety. We started him on Vyvanse 20mg, Depakote twice a day, and Kapvay .1 in the evening last week. We were worried because he talked SO much like he was on speed, and ran around the house looking for paper, books, pens to write with and never sat still but he was very pleasant when we started the Vyvanse. However, he was Always saying I&#039;m sorry for blurting, please, and thank you which was unheard of before starting the Vyvanse.  We were noticing around 4:00 the Vyvanse wearing off and the aggression and whining came back with a vengeance! We added another .1 mg Kapvay after school with his Depakote and the result was AMAZING. He is pleasant ALL day long.""",1
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""Been using it for about 5 months and it has been a miracle worker until recently. A few weeks ago started having random sleepless nights. This week has been terrible waking up after 3-4 hours and feeling wide awake. Not sure if my body is getting used to it but I thought I&#039;d check the reviews to see if anyone else has had the same problem. I hope this is a fluke because Silenor really had changed my life and even though it was expensive it was worth being able to function the next day.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m a 18 year old female, my entire life I&#039;ve always been overweight and I wasn&#039;t able to lose it, it didn&#039;t bother me until I gained 40 pounds in less than a year due to being on birth control. I went from 175 lbs to 215, that&#039;s when being overweight caught up to me. I wasn&#039;t noticing how much the way I looked changed. Until I went clothes shopping and I couldn&#039;t fit into a size 16. That was when I went to my doctor and he recommended Phentermine, It has been almost 3 months and so far I&#039;ve seen nothing but positive results, I lost 31 ponds so far and still going! I bought a size 13 mini skirt, it was too wide! I haven&#039;t fit into a size 11 since I was 15. I strongly recommend it, because of it I smile every time I look in the mirror now.""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started on 8/8/15 at 257lbs, tomorrow will be 2 weeks I have been on it and I&#039;m down to 240lbs, that&#039;s down 17lbs!! I work out 4 to 5 times a week,  walking 3 miles or the elliptical for 45 mins. I have cut out all sweets as I noticed foods with a lot of sugar make me shaking while one the pills. I have like no appetite, but make myself eat at least 3 times a day,  I mostly eat fruits and veggies when I do eat. I drink about 8 bottles of water a day due to dry mouth and excessive sweating when working out.   I have only found 2 side effects dry mouth and constipation which I take a stool softener every morning to help with.""",3
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I have been taking 20mg of Brintellix daily with mixed results for my general anxiety.  I can go as much as 2 consecutive days anxiety free.  However some days I wake up anxious and then over the course of the day the anxiety will lessen.  Also the opposite happens, I wake up with no anxiety and then become anxious over the course of the day.  So far it seems to be somewhat inconsistent.  The best part has been that I have not had any side effects other than some slight constipation.  Also currently a generic does not exist so the medication is somewhat expensive.""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started Contrave on June 19th, 2015. Once I got over the side effects and dosage increase, I had no cravings for sweets or snacks at all. I lost weight very quickly. In the past month, I have noticed that although I eat less as a whole, I do find myself taking some sweets and snacking a little. I have lost 20 lbs, however last month, I did not lose any weight. Anyone else feel like you sort of build up a tolerance to the drug, and it becomes less effective? Any suggestions for me?""",2
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Started treatment on Lithium in the midst of a major depressive episode. Started on 400mg and gradually titrated up to 1000mg. In short, I love this med. I&#039;ve had very few side effects; I&#039;ve gained weight but I think this is mainly due to Quetiapine which I take alongside Lithium. I still experience major shifts in mood, but lithium has made me far less suicidal, less inclined to self harm and has majorly improved my focus, concentration span, verbal dexterity and, in part, manic spells. I am now in what would normally be a manic phase in my cycle and, whilst I still feel a little jittery and excitable, it&#039;s far better than before. Only minor set back is my thyroid function is a little high, but I&#039;m monitoring this with doc. Recommended.""",6
Acetaminophen,Pain,"""Administered an IV bolus of 600mg of Paracetamol to a patient in severe to moderate pain and patient suddenly started sleeping off but that was not expected so I checked and found the pulse unrecordable and BP not measurable. Quickly gave and IV bolus of saline and restored vitals and subsequently monitored patient for the next six hours. I think the effect of rapid administration IV should be hammered on.""",9
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I have been taking the doxycycline for about 1 week now consistently and I have seen tremendous change. One thing about is medication is that you must have patience. It will get worse before it gets better! In addition to taking the doxycycline I also used adapalene to control the breakouts that the doxycycline pushes out. This is coming from someone that has dealt with acne for years and has never found anything that works.""",4

I am not at 2.4 dose.I do walk a lot at work and do a lot of yard work, but other than that, I have NOT worked out or exercised. I do feel full at about 700 to 900 calories. Some days I can not eat more than 500 or so calories. I also have kept it below 100 carbs per day. I feel healthy , a little tired but not so much it interferes with my day.

My skin is dry &amp; irritation around injection site.""",2
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""The pain of insertion was huge and I&#039;ve had lots going on down there with a few cysts and surgery and stuff and this was the worst. Also, no one tells you about the blood from the insertion itself. There was a lot of blood, all over the place. My doctor said it was normal which I&#039;m sure it was, but there was quite a bit, like the floor and the wall and the bed. I have now been bleeding for over two weeks and have had a lot of cramping. I&#039;ve felt like shit, bad headaches, tired and everything. Not fun given it&#039;s end of school year...I have to agree with someones former remark, it&#039;s so effective at birth control because you really just don&#039;t want sex and all the blood. My husband has not been happy.""",8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Let me start off by saying - this drug works.  For most, if not all of middle/high school, I had very bad acne that was resistant to doxycycline, minocycline, proactiv, Murad, benzoyl peroxide, salycilic acid, and all the wipes I could get my hands on.  You more than likely will be free from acne at least for a few years after treatment, and it&#039;s absolutely wonderful!  Being able to walk around without having to check mirrors for a new red/white bump on your face is as great as you think it will is.  Unfortunately all this comes at a cost, which is why they&#039;re so serious and cautious when giving it to you.  They still don&#039;t know exactly how it works - only that it&#039;s permanent.  It doesn&#039;t just affect your acne it affects your entire body.""",4
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I went through a very rough patch and initially started on Lexapro, mostly for anxiety. It made me have no strong feelings, good or bad. I needed that for a while but got concerned about not caring about much of anything. That&#039;s when I weaned myself off of that. Not too long later I realized I still had issues that needed dealt with. My doctor suggested trying wellbutrin instead as it targets different chemicals in the brain. It has made a huge difference for me in dealing with persistent depression. For the first week or two I had night sweats and very vivid nightmares along with a loss of appetite. I&#039;ve been on 150mg twice daily for about a year now and and makes me feel as close to normal as I&#039;ve felt in a while.""",5
Lorazepam,Insomnia,"""The loss of my best friend has changed my world. I have the worse time getting to sleep because I can&#039;t deal with not be able to talk to her anymore. I pray a lot and say thank you Lord over and over like my mantra and sometimes that works. Now Lorazepam has become my close friend as it puts me to sleep and stops the racinG thoughts that are RELENTLESS! I take between 2-3 mg one hour before bed time, because I also take it for anxiety in the day at times. Once in he ER I was given 4mg intravenously and it knocked me out. I had worked a 19 hour shift and my heart was racing. I love my Lorazepam.""",0
Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have to say I&#039;ve this medicine a 7 out of 10 because it has brought me out of both some wicked manias and depressive episodes. The sedation is a love-hate relationship with me- It&#039;s nice for my anxiety, but is also a nuisance. I MUST take this medicine 12 hours before I need to wake up, or I have trouble waking up.

Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""So far I have been on it 5 days and I am experiencing the worsening of my anxiety symptoms. It&#039;s like I can sit still and am in a constant state of panic that even my Xanax is not helping. I am praying that this passes quickly and I start to feel better. I am taking 10mg every morning currently. Supposed to do a checkin with my psychiatrist Tuesday so hopefully the side effects have lessened some by then. I am so amped up with anxiety I am hardly eating and walking about 16,000+ steps a day mainly from pacing. As a stay at home mom of 3 busy kids and a husband who travels frequently I hope relief comes soon!""",7
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamotrigine was the first medication I was prescribed after being diagnosed with bipolar II at 32 years old.

Almost immediately, I felt more even. As I was titrated from 25 mg to 250 mg over a few months, I was lifted out of a severe, crippling depression. Lamotrigine is my %u201Cpep%u201D drug because it works for me as an antidepressant. 

I did go manic on it a couple times when the medication dosage was increased and had to go on a second medication (Neurontin) to %u201Cbring me down.%u201D But the two meds together work to even me out.

I have to have it so I&#039;m glad that I can take this and not feel sick or have any side effects that are bad. I&#039;m on the 100mg tablets for two weeks my doctor said that he is going to up the dose after the surgery and put me on something else to. Then I go right back on my Suboxone Plan. So if you are like me and you are on Suboxone this is a good medicine to be on for pain if you are having surgery that&#039;s why I&#039;m giving it a 10 out of 10. I hope this was helpful in a way!""",9
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have adhesions related to multiple abdominal surgeries and some nerve damage as well. I was on Vicodin for 6 months and was referred to a pain clinic. Being a nurse I had seen Ultram used in the hospital with good pain control. I suggested I try it and stop the Vicodin. It was an incredibly easy transition and the benefits were immediate.

I too have noticed a definite mood stabilizing. I was having mood swings on the Vicodin that were affecting my relationships with others. I feel calmer and my pain is nearly gone at 200mg daily. I am so thankful for having relief. I think it&#039;s a wonderful drug.""",9
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I had Skyla inserted 4 months ago. I took two ibuprofen prior to the procedure. The procedure itself only took about 15 minutes. I felt a sharp pain as the IUD was inserted and experienced cramps throughout the day. The next the day, they were gone. I did have some sharp cramps sporadically throughout the first two weeks I had the IUD, but they subsided. Since then, I&#039;ve had no other real side effects, aside from lighter periods and I&#039;ve noticed my hair seems to shed more than it used to. Overall, I&#039;m very happy with the IUD so far.""",8
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve suffered from acne since I was about 12 years old and I&#039;ve had to deal with it straight up until college. Over the years I tried countless acne products, but nothing worked for me and I became really discouraged. Luckily, I was recently prescribed the Retin A Cream 0.05% by my dermatologist and my skin is thriving! My blemishes has cleared up so much, it is mindboggling. I can&#039;t tell you how much this cream has helped my skin. It&#039;s been like a blessing. When I first started using it, I was skeptical because I didn&#039;t see any results, but keep using. Don&#039;t become discouraged! It works. If it worked for me, someone who has struggled with acne for half of her life, it will work for you.""",4
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""Used to take the stimulant alertec  for my narcolepsy to help me stay awake but a new doctor took me off it and put me on Seroquel in hopes it would help me sleep better which in turn would help me be more rested during the day it has been a godsend been on it for over a year  I take 50 mg after dinner sleep like a baby  before would wake up and then couldn&#039;t fall back to sleep for a long time now can fall back to sleep after  needing the toilet no problem""",0
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I have had this implant for 2 years and it&#039;s great ! The longest that I had my period for was a month. But it was only really light spotting. I have not suffered any side effects except blacking out 
twice after getting it implanted. But even with blacking out I&#039;m not too sure it was from the implant as it hasn&#039;t happened since. Now I have not had my period for 8 months and it&#039;s great !""",8
Oxycodone,Pain,"""After severely injuring my back while lifting a patient, herniating three discs, three failed back surgeries and multiple ineffective pain relief measures I finally accepted that I will need medication until a cure for spinal nerve damage is found. Using oxycodone means I can walk my dog, keep my house neat, enjoy life with my husband and live life again. I am scruptiously careful about how much I take and keep them under lock and key for the safety of my grandchildren. With great care this drug can give you your life back. However if a person doesn&#039;t take very seriously the potential addiction properties it can make a bad situation worse.""",9
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""I cannot describe how life changing this medication has been for me. I&#039;ve been suffering from anxiety/depression, specifically social anxiety and low self esteem, my whole life. It was at a point where I thought it was normal to be negative, pessimistic, anxious and depressed all the time. I tried EVERYTHING including therapy, exercise, diet and an array of medicines and nothing worked. I nearly developed an addiction to Xanax just trying to combat the anxiety. Prozac, lexapro, Concerta, stratera; Nothing worked. Finally got introduced to Effexor XR. Started on 75mg for 2 months, I wasn&#039;t that satisfied. I got put on 150mg for 2 months then. CANNOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE. I&#039;m happy, confident and positive. AMAZING. Long may it last.""",7
Celexa,Depression,"""I have been taking Celexa 20MG for a few years and found it to be quite helpful in the beginning. It is true I have heard that Celexa is one of the better medications out there for depression, with little side effects. I haven&#039;t experienced much side effects until now. In fact I just came back from seeing my psychiatrist this afternoon and I told him about the side effects I was having. He suggested I clean my system of the medication for 2 weeks and come back to see him in 2 weeks to see if I am still suffering the side effects. At this point in time, I haven&#039;t quite decided what I want to do. If anything, I might want to lower the dosage to 10MG.""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""This medication has given me a love hate for it, I had horrible cystic acne all over my face neck shoulders chest and back! I have been on the medication 3 weeks now and have seen a drastic improvement! I have tried other medications that yielded no results at all. If you want to start taking this medication for your acne I recommend it but be warned the side effects are nasty! I have the worst joint pain in my feet and ankles every morning and it last for a few hours also my lips have been very dry and I have been applying way too much carmax.  my face has dry spot from where the acne is clearing up and that doesn&#039;t look too attractive either. All in all this medication works and you will love the results but the side effects suck""",4
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I can not believe the cost of OPANA ER!  After my wife and I pay our deductible for the OPANA ER we still get the shaft!  I take four a day and after insurance I pay $250.00 for 30 days and my wife takes six a day for 30 days and hers is $350.00 after insurance pays!  This is ludicrous. When I was given this medicine last year I decided that I was not going to take any more test or take any more medicine unless if is generic and cheap and that the tests were paid a 100%. """,9
Adderall,ADHD,"""I was on adderall for about 10 years after I lost too much weight on Dexatrin. I began when I was about 10 and went all the way up to 40-60 mg a day, depending on how I felt. I was great for focus, but I definitely had sweaty pits, which I find really annoying. After Adderall stopped working, I switched to Concerta for 3 years, then to VyvanSe, which was incredible. All of these medications, though, made me feel like a schizo. Because I started so young, I got used to the feelings, but I would be a robot when I was on them, and coming down, irritable until I ate, then crazy hyper. Adderall did everything it was supposed to do, and because of it I was able to get into a great boarding school, great college, and now grad school.""",1
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I&#039;m gonna&#039; make this simple. I took spironolactone and lived happily ever after PERIOD. (God willing)
OK fine, I&#039;ll elaborate.
-Age: 35. 
-Chin acne sufferer.
-Tried A-Z of meds/birth control pills.
-Used Accutane as a teen. Worked until adulthood.
-Taking spiro @ 25mg (half of one pill): No initial breakout. No spotting. No period issues. Instant clearing of skin and no joke. 
-Side effects: I pee a lot...so what? 
-Not on the bcp with it, just spiro by itself.
FYI I took spiro a year ago before for 5 months @ 50mg a day with same great results but stopped because I had intense breast tenderness. Boohoo, I should have just lowered my dosage but I was stupid. 
-spiro worked for me but if it doesn&#039;t for you, don&#039;t give up.""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""2nd Update: 7m 10d &amp; I am still very happy with this med. Down 31lbs so far: started at 229lbs/36.4bmi; today at 198lbs/31.5bmi; goal is 156lbs/24.8bmi - just to get out of the &ldquo;obese&rdquo; range. I was inconsistent for a while (no pills while away on a 3wk vacay &amp; only 2pills/day for a few months) &amp; didn&rsquo;t see any side effects or weight gain, just plateaued, which is good to know for when I go off this med someday. Back on the full dose for a few weeks &amp; losing weight again. Very easy to skip a meal &amp; hardly notice, which is where the real weight loss comes in. I don&rsquo;t crave the bad foods I used to &amp; don&rsquo;t mindlessly eat. ScaleDown trial ran out (was able to keep the scale) but after a few months it was only generic info anyway &amp; not worth it.""",2
Lorazepam,Insomnia,"""I had real bad anxiety, which put me in the hospital. This medicine saved my life. It calms my soul, and stops my minds from racing to where I can&#039;t sleep and I&#039;m exhausted and irritable the next day. When I was not sleeping and stressed out I would sleep for about 3 hours, which did not help my heart, I have bradycardia - slow heart rate. So imagine that on no sleep. 

I can&#039;t say enough about it, except it saved my life.   

I hope this helps!

Methadone,Pain,"""I broke my neck after a fall from a bridge in 2000. After many failed surgeries, an ANS spinal implant that didn&#039;t work, pain medications were my only option. Like many of you, I was prescribed Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, OxyContin, MS Contin, Fentanyl, in varying orders and dosages, and then Methadone. While all of the previously named medications have their pro&#039;s and con&#039;s, I did experience one side effect with Methadone that I haven&#039;t seen listed or heard of anyone experience before. After 2 or 3 days on the medication, I started having very vivid and disturbing nightmares. While I understand this may be a &quot;wonder drug&quot; for many of you, there are some of us out there that disagree.""",9
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I was having trouble conceiving so, I had tests done, DNC (just to clean the inside and make sure it was OK), got put on a fertility pills but they made me gain weight. I started adipex July 18th weight was 305 pounds. I&#039;m always thirsty with dry mouth, quit drinking everything except water and coffee, only eating low carb foods, and when I get hungry I only eat little portions and I get full faster. I do not have a job and don&#039;t exercise everyday but I&#039;m constantly doing something or going somewhere and the meds have really helped in my weight loss, self confidence, and changed my life style. As if August 17th I am down to 289 pounds, I have lost 16 lbs in 1 month. Currently on month 2 will post as weight loss continues.""",3
Seroquel,Insomnia,"""I have had insomnia for almost 30 years, since puberty.  Having a child made it worse.  Diagnosed with Hypomania, which explained why I woke up and started having racing thoughts once the sun went down.  Tried every sleeping pill there, in combination at times.  This is the only thing that worked.  I am doing 50mg with 4mg clonazepam 2 hours before bed.  I take it on an empty stomach as I have learned within an hour of taking it you will get HUNGRY.  So I simply eat my dinner late.  Have not gained weight yet.""",0
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This was the first mood stabilizer I was put on when I was diagnosed BP2 and I&#039;ve been on it ever since, which was about 9 years ago. I love this med- I&#039;ve had NO side effects. I&#039;m on 500mg which is a very high dose but I&#039;m also very treatment resistant. The only negative thing about this med is that I can&#039;t go on birth control. I have horrible mood swings and pain around &#039;that time&#039; and birth control would help, but besides it lessening the effect of the birth control it also lessens the effectiveness of lamictal. There may be some birth control pill out there I can take, but my pdoc, and gyno haven&#039;t found it. :( Besides that this med is amazing &amp; I&#039;ll never go off of it""",6
Depakote ER,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was treated for clinical depression from age 18-40 using a variety of medications. I&#039;ve also struggled with alcoholism, drug and sex addiction most of my adult life. I had a period of six years&#039; solid sobriety beginning in the mid 90&#039;s but, even sober, battled with diagnosed clinical depression. At that time I was being treated with Serzone. The more the doctor increased the dosage the more depressed I would become. I obsessed on failed relationships, acted out sexually and financially in very risky ways. I finally changed Psychiatrists at the suggestion of my Therapist. The new doctor analyzed my symptoms and indicated that I had been misdiagnosed with clinical depression. His prognosis was Bipolar II Disorder accompanied by acute depression""",6
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Deeply depressed for 7 months after a manic period of 7 months.  Would come home from work and just go to bed and stay there for 14 hours until it was time to go to work again.  Taking Bupropion in the AM without effect in increasing doses for all 7 months.  After titrating up the Lamictal through the increasing doses as required, the fog lifted 3 days after I started on the 200mg dose.  Thank you modern medicine""",6
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""My husband was hospitalized for 10 weeks before passing away. I could not sleep - my thoughts were spiraling and racing. I had an anxiety attack in the intensive care unit and thought I was having a heart attack. I hadn&#039;t slept in 5 days. My doctor prescribed 1 mg Ativan taken 30 mins before bedtime. What a godsend. I sleep straight for 6 hours every night. I&#039;ve tried sleeping without it and I&#039;m awake all night. I worry about tolerance. So I go without it on weekends and lay awake for two nights.  I can&#039;t wait til Sunday night so I can take the Ativan and get some sleep.   I&#039;ve been on it for 6 months now.""",7
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m confused about comments. Do most bi- polar 1 patients find Geodon taken before sleep helps sleeplessness? I have been taking Geodon the last 6 months and weaned myself off of lithium. The only side affect I have with Geodon is sleeplessness. Is Geodon more effective taken in the evening? I see my Dr.in a month, I will bring up patient responses to Geodon,taken before bedtime. I&#039;m willing to try! """,6
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""I have been on Effexor for the past 10 years - I started having panic attacks as a child although I didn&#039;t know at the time what was going on - when I was 17 the doctor prescribed Valium that I took periodically when my anxiety got really bad - finally when I was 40 the doctor suggested I go on a very low dosage of Effexor (37.5mg) because he was sure I had generalized anxiety disorder - what a difference this has made in my life - felt&quot;weird&quot; the first few weeks but now I have very little anxiety and really no side effects except maybe lower libido. I had no idea how much anxiety I had been living with all my life.""",7
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I started on Belviq the last week in March and have seen nothing but improvements.  This is the weight loss pill of my dreams! I have lost 22lbs starting at 275 and 5&#039;6&quot;. It really does make you not even think about eating.  Though it doesn&#039;t take the taste of foods away you still don&#039;t want to eat much.  I&#039;ve changed several things in my eating to help and pretty soon will be able to start working out like I&#039;ve always wanted to.  The side effects I have seem to be beneficial to me.  Dry mouth - drink more water, I sleep better at night, I feel better as a person, slower heart beat - I&#039;m more relaxed and calm. I don&#039;t have or at least notice any headaches as those are a thing of life for me.  Really consider the benefits and try it!""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started Phentermine 37.5mg daily on 8/3/16. My weight was 272 while at my physical with my doctor. I had been exercising and watching my diet for about  3 weeks prior to that and lost 17 pounds. This morning marks one week of taking phentermine and i weighed in at 265. I use this pill to help resist temptations, not to stop me from eating or drop caloric intake. Yes, I can tell that I am not hungry all the time but I still make myself eat something light and healthy. My goal is to lose weight, not end up in a hospital. I exercise at least four times a week in which I prefer to walk briskly. I truly believe it has made a huge difference in my outcome. I have energy throughout my day and I sleep well at night.""",3
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""I have been taking low dose mirtazapine (3.75 mgs) for about 10 wks now for anxiety, insomnia and mild depression. I was prescribed this after being unable to tolerate SSRI anti depressants and having a very bad reaction to Lexapro. Mirtazapine has worked well for insomnia and I started noticing improvements in anxiety levels and mood within 3-4 wks of starting.  I initially had a mild increase in appetite but no weight gain, and my appetite is now normal. The drawback to this med is daytime fatigue/groggy sensation that does not lift until late afternoon. I was told this would improve with time, but it has not. For this reason I will likely taper off the med soon - not something I can put up with long term despite being effective for insomnia/anxiety.""",7
Solodyn,Acne,"""I was on Solodyn for 7 weeks. I had borderline cyst acne and a lot of redness/PIH. Although Solodyn reduced the amount of &#039;new&#039; acne that I got, and some of the cysts did end up rising to heads and disappeared (albeit slowly), the results weren&#039;t as dramatic as I hoped. I was still getting a fair amount of acne (maybe 50% as prior to the medicine after 4 weeks).

My dermatologist ended up putting me on doxycycline instead, and it&#039;s been much more effective (and MUCH cheaper) than solodyn.""",4
Bupropion,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve just started and yes while I do feel something I have yet to make a full decision on if it works. My issue is focus, hard to focus on life in general , can&#039;t pay attention long enough to learn which really hurts at work. 

I was taking Naboline and Marijuana which helped perfectly. For whatever reason my dr wants me to try something else . My questions is if something g works why put me on something that might work ?

But I&#039;m willing to try. The first three days I have felt similar effects but not to the extent that the other drugs help. I feel a bit more irritated with people , my hearing is more sensitive and my appetite is gone.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""UPDATED REVIEW:
Okay, so I started Adipex on 9/15/16, I&#039;m 5&#039;5&quot; and at the time weighed 240. 16 days later (10/1/16) I&#039;m down to 228.  The side effects have subsided (insomnia, crashing, jitteriness, etc...).  I find that I can go the whole day without eating due to lack of appetite which is not good.  I do have to remind myself eat throughout the day, but that is not a big deal.  I would definitely recommend this product/medication to someone who is overweight and finding it hard to lose weight on their own.  So far it seems to be working! Let&#039;s see how the next month goes!""",3
Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,"""Was on Lexapro 20 for a while but after a bipolar NOS diagnosis, doctor wanted to remove Lexapro and go to Seroquel XR. Usually I sleep 7 hrs, after taking 50mg the first night I slept 13 hours and was barely awake after that. The next night on 100mg I slept 12 hours and was barely functioning throughout the day. I went back to 50 and then back to 100 again and repeatedly found that I was in a haze until the early afternoon. I noticed no positive results and stopped after a week. Will now try Abilify.  Also, I had rather intense dreams and nightmares.""",6
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I have hypothyroidism and its very hard for me to lose weight. I have been trying everything, spent so much money and no results, NOTHING helped. I started this May 3rd I weighed 327lbs and its now may 14th and I weigh 313lbs. It has helped me so much, I exercise a lot and eat healthy now. I have no cravings for any of those bad foods I used to love. I strongly suggest this to anyone who is overweight. I absolutely love it and I have had not one side effect at all.""",2
Ketorolac,Pain,"""Don&#039;t be afraid of this drug it&#039;s AMAZING!! I frequently get violent migraines and prefer NON-opioid treatment since I usually drive myself to the Urgent Care or in some cases the ER and don&#039;t have help with transportation. I also noticed that I get rebound headaches from opioid based pain meds as with Toradol I do not experience that. Toradol has worked quite well intravenously as well as injected. When I visit the ER they give a cocktail of terodol/methadone/steroid. It&#039;s a great combo that covers pain, nausea and inflammation. I personally have a weak/sensitive stomach and do not experience any upset stomach or nausea from it. (however the methadone is given for nausea since I usually am dry heaving from the migraine pain)""",9
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""This month was my two year mark of having the implant in. I have not had a full period, or used a tampon once in the last two years. I have about one, rarely two, days of very light spotting approximately once every three to four months. My fianc&eacute; always finishes inside of me, without a condom or another form of birth control, and we have never had any issues or concerns. Nexplanon definitely serves it&#039;s purpose in my case. However, I have slowly gained about 30 pounds in the last two years, while eating well and exercising. I cannot get the weight off, and may get the implant out to lose weight before my wedding. Overall I&#039;d recommend Nexplanon as it&#039;s serves it&#039;s purpose. If it weren&#039;t for the weight gain I&#039;d get it done again.""",8
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I lost 110lbs in 2004 but regained a bit. Been at same weight for almost six years now.  I take Phentermine 37.5mg/day since 2004. In 2010 my doctor suggested we add Topamax to my daily dose of Phentermine. No weight loss and my hair began to fall out.  He had equally poor results with other patients. On 10/8 I was put on Belviq 10mg/day for 15 days ($0) before increasing dose to 20mg/day ($159).  10/8-10/17 no weight loss...thought I was a non responder but I wanted to stick it out for the 12 week trial. 10/17-11/7 down 4lbs. I feel GREAT and I changed nothing in my diet or exercise routine. 12/9 visit, down 10lbs. No wonder my doc was so excited to start using this. Thank you Belviq!""",3
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have just started Latuda and I am so happy with it (I will update after I&#039;ve been on it for a while). 

I switched from Olanzapine and the difference is incredible. Olanzapine had me feeling groggy and tired. Latuda, from day one, has had my brain feeling clear and I&#039;ve had my my energy back! My apartment is finally clean and I&#039;m not losing everything all the time (seriously - I lost my phone daily before) 

The only &quot;side effect&quot; is that I am super drowsy when I take it, which has to be with dinner, so the whole night I&#039;m tired. I see this as a positive, because I used to be up all night on olanzapine. 

Plus, I wake up in the morning and I&#039;m wide awake! Latuda has been amazing!""",6
Pristiq,Depression,"""I have found all these comments really helpful and reassuring. I started taking Pristiq yesterday and it is the first antidepressant I have tried. After taking my first dose I felt very groggy/tired but I had trouble sleeping last night and had frustrating, repetitive dreams when I finally got off to sleep. Today I have taken my second dose in the morning so that hopefully I can sleep tonight. So far I am not feeling drowsy today and I have been feeling good emotionally. I am optimistic about this treatment and love all the positive comments.""",5
Oxycodone,Pain,"""This is a wonderful drug. Blue Cross will cover other pain drugs but this is the only one that works for me, and I have tried them all.  I take x3 80mg pills 3 times a day, with up to 8, 30mg Morphine IR, and 8 Norco 10/325.  Yes this is a lot of medication but it works. My doctor knows that I, a 26 year old male, 230 lbs. needs this amount, I have no side effects other than having a hard time sleeping. MS Contin is good too, but Oxycontin is what works best for me.""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had Mirena inserted 4 months after my 2nd child was born. I bled for about 6 months after that and most of the time it was heavy until the end. I also experienced a lot of pregnancy symptoms.  Now my periods have stopped other than long spells of spotting at random times. Sometimes I will have indications that I am going to start and then I don&#039;t.  I now am suffering from lack of energy, low sex drive and an overall sick feeling most of the day.

Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got this birth control put in around early October and today is March 11th. I&#039;ve scheduled to take it out on Thursday. I read a million horror stories on IUDs but figured every woman&#039;s body is different so I&#039;d try it. The insertion was EXTREMELY painful  but a really short process. The pain lasted about 40 seconds. Cramps lasted that day but then went away pretty quickly. About 4 months in I started getting UTI&#039;s every single time I had sex. Before I got this IUD I was having sex everyday with my bf sometimes 2 or 3 times a day and never had any issues with UTI&#039;s. I know how to clean myself and how to prevent them so clearly it was my IUD causing them. Also I&#039;ve now had my period for 3 weeks and cramp and back pain. Can&#039;t wait to remove it""",8
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I used this medicine under strict supervision at a pain management center after failed trials with Opana and Kadian which made me ill. Vicodin was not strong enough as I have had open back surgery from my skull to mid back to drain a spinal cord cyst called a &quot;syrinx.&quot; My spine was arthritic and required struts to rebuild it; I now have chronic acute pain just holding up my head (max 5-6 hours at a time). Also have chronic low back pain arthritis and herniation with tear. Thankfully it relieved my pain and helped me function somewhat normally for 5-6 months. Then one month the refill arrived two days late and I went through withdrawal, suffering horribly with dark suicidal ideation and depression. I got off it. Now on Percocet, not ideal.""",9
Mydayis,ADHD,"""Today was my first day on mydayis 50mg. I was taking vyvanse 50mg but it was only helping for about 4-5 hours then wearing off. Today I could really tell the difference in my concentration/ focus and my energy; it was much better. I did however feel tired about an hour to two hrs after taking it but then got  motivation after that for the remainder of the day. Like I said my focus was better I wasn&rsquo;t running around my house like a crazy woman starting a ton of tasks and finishing none. I was able to get things accomplished pretty easily today. I am remaining hopeful that mydayis will continue to work for me.""",1
Topiramate,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Topamax twice now. I don&rsquo;t typically write reviews for medications, in fact, I never have. 

I took Topamax at 100mg along with Lamicital 100mg for Bipolar, I slowly titrated off my meds because my doctor and I thought I possibly could function without them. Bad idea. I spiralled into a terrible manic episode where I was sleeping less than 2 hours a night, even on high doses of Ambien and Lunesta.

I finally was put back on Topamax 200mg this time and it has saved my life. I feel better than ever. Initially I was put back on 100 mg and I felt better, began sleeping 3-4 hours a night within a week. Went up to 200 mg and within 2 days was sleeping 9 hours a night and my racing thoughts and anxiety had completely gone away""",6
Remeron,Insomnia,"""I have taken Remeron for 3.5 years.  I was experiencing a family crisis, was anxious, depressed and could not sleep.

You MUST go on Remeron slowly. 1/4 of the dissolving tablet for a week, then 1/2 for a week or 2.  I was told never, never to start with a whole dose or to quit cold turkey.  TITRATE is the key.  I get real food cravings late at night.  But, I don&#039;t eat. Remeron is the best antidepressant I have ever taken.""",0
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I have taken one pill, waited it said 30 minutes and I thought O better lay down then, four hours later I wasn&#039;t asleep I was wide awake and had a bad headache. Next night my Doctor upped the dose, still no sleep and another very bad headache. I&#039;m done, I also felt very odd I can&#039;t explain it disconnected. I would not recommend this drug at all. It&#039;s expensive and does more harm than good""",0
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on Depakote, Lithium and now Trileptal.  Trileptal has given me absolutely no side effects, no weight gain and it controls my mood.  I was bumping into walls, throwing up, feeling like I was high and eating everything in sight on Depakote.  I gained so much weight.  On Lithium, I did well, but couldn&#039;t deal with the gastrointestinal issues, as well as urinating every other hour, and being thirsty all the time.  Nothing quenched my thirst.  This medicine is like taking a vitamin and it has stabilized my moods for almost 5 years now.""",6
Silenor,Insomnia,"""Great product.
I never had a problem falling asleep before, I can and always could fall asleep in 2 or 3 minutes.
My problem was during the night when I would wake up at 2am and be up for the day.
With Silenor I still wake up on occasion but I go right back to sleep.
I have been taking it for months now, still works great.
Not groggy the next day.
If your problem is getting to sleep this might not be right for you.
If your problem is staying asleep or falling back to sleep after waking up during the night then Silenor will be a big help.""",0
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""I take Phentermine 37.5 and a side effect is horrible insomnia. I went almost a solid two weeks before I called my doc to help me find something that would keep me sleeping through the night. She gave me GABA. I take it 30 minutes prior to when I want to get to sleep with my 75mg of Topirimate and my Spironolatone and within the hour, I&#039;m out. I&#039;m very sensitive to medication also. But I woke up feeling refreshed and not at all zombie-like. I woke up at 2am to give my son a bottle and diaper change with no problem waking up and going back to sleep. I&#039;ve only taken this medicine for four nights but very happy on it so far!! As I said I am very sensitive to medication so finding one that doesn&#039;t make me have lingering side effects is great!""",0
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I just started with Opana ER 5mg every 12 hours. The first time I used it, it did help with the pain, not much but a little. Then after a few days, I started suffering from some of the side effects. Anxiety attacks that verged on the near panic attack stage, difficulty breathing, and a few others. I told my doctor that I have heart problems, asthma, and a history of seizures, but he decided that he would give it to me anyway.  I am glad that Opana ER works for some, but it is not the one for me.""",9
Bupropion,Depression,"""Was on Prozac for 15 yrs, if it&#039;s not broke don&#039;t fix it kind of thing, wanted to drop the sexual side effects and apathy so after research requested bupropion (am a nurse). If you can stick out the first few weeks of side effects (same as others have sited) it is worth it. Can finally respond to my husband and am able to feel sadness and joy and concentrate more clearly. Do be mindful of any fluctuations you may feel with different manufacturer generics your pharmacy may use. It could be a nightmare (it was for me), like plummeting into an abyss in turmoil. Went to a different pharmacy to order the version that works for me!""",5
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I am a 38 year old male. I have been deployed to Iraq 3 times and have very bad post traumatic stress disorder and could not sleep due to very bad dreams so my DR put me on 50mg Seroquel taken once at bed time and I sleep very well, in fact without it I do not sleep. I still have bad dreams (well that&#039;s what I am told) but I do not remember them and sleep right through them. I would recommend Seroquel to anyone who might be having the same problem that I was.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am 26 and started taking classes again. I was diagnosed ADD at 9 and was off and on Adderall and Ritialin through high school. I would always take it in the morning of school days, and not take it on weekends. I&#039;m on 70 mg Vyvanse now I&#039;ve been on for 3 months. I like it because it suppresses my appetite the least of the 3 medicines. I&#039;m getting concerned though, because with school and work I will take 2 a day sometimes. But I still don&#039;t take it on non work or school days, but my concern is I think I am feeling withdrawal effects. I took it 12 days straight between 70 and 140mg a day, and the first day I didn&#039;t take it I couldn&#039;t get out of bed and felt depressed and had no motivation. I&#039;m on day 2 and my brain feels like mush.""",1
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""Been taking Lexapro 10mg for 4 weeks now. It started to help a little after just 2 days. Now I have very few guilt feelings, nearly no depression, no suicidal thoughts, no obsessing over negative things. Not too much help with social anxiety, but does help anxiety around angry people.  Unfortunately, during PMS, it barely helps me, but once that is passed, I&#039;m okay again. Makes sleep WONDERFUL and easy.
Side effects-sleepy off and on during the day, mild, treatable, headaches the first few days.""",7
Viibryd,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on quite a few medicines the last 14 years. Zoloft, Prozac, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Xanax combination, Effexor to name a few. My doctor started me on Viibryd a week ago I&#039;m on 10mg and tomorrow I start the 20mg. So far this pill has been a lifesaver. I haven&#039;t had any side effects that many people speak of. I heard you got to eat with it and the key is protein because it helps the pill absorb into your system. I&#039;ve been very happy and positive but not too happy as some pills will do. So far it has been the best depression pill I have tried.""",5
Effexor,Depression,"""I took this medicine about 6 years ago for depression and PTSD . This is a horrible medication, doctor I saw told me it was a magic drug for depression. Magic as in the sense it is god awful and turned me into a monster. I went from being depressed to being super depressed. I think I suffered from all of the side effects listed, and now that I had a genetic test to find out why medications didn&#039;t work on me , I know why. Being a poor metabolizer made it so the medications build up in my system and I get the horrible side effects, and this one was no different. The withdrawal from this was god awful almost unbearable, from the brain zaps, to the uncontrolled crying, all the way to a 1 day hospital stay. Stay away""",5
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and often find myself unable to fall asleep (note I take about 4 mg of klonopin a day). I&#039;ve never used a sleep aid before this, other then melatonin, and after almost 2 weeks of broken sleep I could say I had a solid 8 hours and actually needed my alarm to wake me up for once lol. The klonopin helps but I don&#039;t like taking it right before bed and would never give me a sleep like this. Woke up a little groggy but nothing unusual, no hallucinations or side effects. 12mg did the trick (broke the pill 20mg) and my gf said she&#039;s never seen my sleep like that, I was drooling lol. Long story short it is an effective sleep aid for me and suffered no ill effects. Felt well rested as well.""",0
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I have trouble sleeping from 3 - 6 am.  I wake up and cannot go back to sleep creating the daytime symptoms of insomnia (see: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/basics/definition/CON-20024293 ). I rarely have trouble falling asleep.
I have been taking LIQUID doxepin for 18+ months (along with a 5 mg time release melatonin) - 30 min before bedtime.  The LIQUID has to be especially prescribed by your Dr and approved by your drug company.  A 120 ml bottle is $79 - with medicare &amp; drug co approval, my out of pocket (last bought in 6/2016) was $7! Much cheaper than Silenor.  I am prescribed 0.6ml/night, but sometimes I take 0.5ml or less, &amp; never over 0.7ml (rarely).
Doxepin &amp; melatonin work well to help me sleep from 10p-6a!""",0
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I just started this med and I am on week 5 of the &quot;starter&quot; pack. I know it&#039;s a little soon to give my opinion BUT I want to give words of encouragement if you&#039;re struggling with your diagnosis and taking &quot;that pill&quot;. I spent so much time in a deep, dark hole and I started getting &quot;scared&quot; that I wasn&#039;t going to see sunshine in my life again. I became desperate enough to call my Doc and agreed that I was &quot;probably&quot; bipolar (she saw it and I was in denial!) and I was willing to talk &quot;meds&quot;. After the first two weeks I noticed that life was looking better and I felt like participating a little...by the end of week 4 I was able to have a conversation. I&#039;m starting to see beautiful colors in my once bleak world!""",6
Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorde,"""After taking Lamitcal (250mg) for a 8 months or so to address my highly recurrent depressive episode, I realized I was still feeling agitated/annoyed/worried/anxious etc. Psych prescribed a low dose (100-300mg, up to 3x/day) to take as needed. I take it when I know something stressful, or a stressful part of my week, will be coming up. It seems to &#039;just work,&#039; subtly within 30 minutes. It works so well and it is so subtle that I more than half wonder if it&#039;s all just the placebo effect. However it works, I&#039;m happy to have found a chill pill that has no side effects, is non-habit forming and can be taken as needed rather than feeling enslaved to it.""",6
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I have anxiety and am agoraphobic. I have constant anxiety, which I can usually deal with without medicines. But when my anxiety becomes extreme, clonazepam calms me quickly. It also works when I take one before I am going to be in a situation that I know will cause my anxiety to be intolerable (like a crowded grocery store). I take them only as needed, not necessarily every day, so I don&#039;t worry about addiction or withdrawals. However, I did go through withdrawal once. I found that cutting back on my dosage over a couple of days alleviated my withdrawal symptoms. This medicine has helped me face my fears and I fully expect to one day either use it rarely or completely stop needing it.""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been taking CONTRAVE about 2 months or so&hellip;and have had great success with it. It will make you nauseous at times; but it was pretty rare. For the most part, I just didn&#039;t care to eat (which was amazing&hellip;as I&#039;m down 28 or so pounds!)

I did a couple of things right; knowing that it could make me nauseous, I didn&#039;t stop eating pretty regularly for the first 5 or 6 days (and that helped my stomach handle it). But I&#039;ve never been able to just forget to eat. Ever.

In the 8 weeks, I threw up 4 times&hellip;which is the only thing I can see that could be dicey if I&#039;m in a situation where I can&#039;t run to a restroom. But other than that being able to lose that much weight (that I&#039;ve never been able to get rid of in 20 years) was amazing. Miracle!""",2
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed three years ago with adult ADD (and I&#039;m 46!). First was prescribed Adderall, but I found that even the slow-release capsule wore off quickly, leaving me exhausted and crashing at work, scarfing down cups of coffee. My doctor switched me by Vyvanse, and it&#039;s been much, much better. I am better able to focus, it lasts longer. However, it still doesn&#039;t get me through the whole day and I find I&#039;m extremely tired at night. Also, sometimes I get caught up in the trivial details of both work and home projects. But on the whole, I am FAR better off since I began Vyvanse. I wish that 70mg was not the highest recommended amount, but I stick to it.""",1
Copper,Birth Control,"""I had my paragard placed when I was 19 and I have never had any kids. I did a lot of research before I asked my gyno if it was a good option for me. I asked her at least 10 questions about the paragard, how it works, how it&#039;s placed, the side effects, and how many paragard she had placed. Asking my doctor those questions really helped put my mind at ease. She had me come to the office to have it placed the second day of my period because my cervix was soft and the actual insertion was uncomfortable but still tolerable. The one side effect I have had was my hair thinned out and became a little more brittle for about six months but that stopped after a while too. My periods are a little bit heavier than before but are still regular.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have started taking Adipex 5 days ago and I have lost eight pounds already. This is a wonderful drug. I have been on and off of it for years. You can lose weight very fast with this pill. It really works if you want to lose weight. You may experience dry mouth. You don&#039;t feel hungry, you have to make yourself eat. I haven&#039;t been doing any kind of workouts, but plan to start. I go back to my doctor 8-26-10. She said that I would have to lose 6 pound if I want to get more. I started out at 187 and now I am 179.""",3
Trazodone,Depression,"""Wow. A pa prescribed this for me in addition with 150 mgs of Zoloft. It&#039;s a life changer. Sometimes i have restless legs and a slight headache but I&#039;ll take that over depression and loss of interest any day! I sleep so good and am just generally a happy person. I was prescribed it for sleep but it does much more than that! If you&#039;re looking for great restful sleep or even an anti depressant booster...look no further!""",5
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Have been taking Saxenda since mid July 2015. Starting weight 303 lbs. Very few side affects, maybe some nausea for a day at each dose increase but nothing at all since then. Along with the medication have been carefully controlling calorie intake, which has been made much easier with Saxenda, and exercising frequently. Total weight loss is 40 lbs, however I have been at a plateau for about a month. Will stay on the medication and work on ways to break through this plateau.""",2
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Hadnt weighed in years, went for a vasectomy march 5th 2016 and weighed 347 lbs. i was shocked. Started a diet that day and on june 5th had lost 27lbs to that point.

Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Day 10 of Saxenda I cannot believe that my sugar cravings disappeared the first day. Nausea has been a big issue but I started adding slices of fresh ginger to my water and that has saved me. I&#039;m down 5 lbs. I split the 1.2 dose to .6 morning and afternoon. It&#039;s working I&#039;m thrilled. Insurance covered all but $200 a month, but the doc gave me a savings card that you can get online so next 10 months will be $30.""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the implant 2.5 years ago. In the first 3 months, I had crazy emotions. I was violent and depressed.

Now that I&#039;m in my last 5 months of it, I&#039;ve been excperiencing the same mood swings from the beginning. Its  uncontrollable and scary. That&#039;s the only downside I have.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""This is my 3rd month taking Contrave and have lost 10 lbs.

Effexor,Depression,"""Horrible experience, although everyone is different. I was on 150mg, I am currently tapering off while switching to Welbutrin. With Effexor  tapering is necessary. I&#039;ve tried going off cold turkey and the withdrawals are like nothing I&#039;ve ever experience. I had intense brain zaps (google it), flu like symptoms, could easily sleep half a day away. Even if you miss one day, you experience these withdrawal symptoms. While on it, it only worked somewhat well for a month or so. I experienced light nausea which went away. I also experienced impotence and unable to climax which has not gone away. Now that I&#039;m tapering and introducing Welbutrin the sexual side effects seem to be getting better.""",5
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I have taken alprazolam for about 2 weeks now and it has really helped control my anxiety.  I had my first panic attack and then started getting them everyday and they would last all day.  For the first 3 or 4 days I had to take alprazolam every 5 hours (3 times a day).  Then I would get the panic attacks when I woke up (9 am) and then around 5pm, so then I took 2 pills a day for about 4 days.  Now I am down to one pill in the morning because I keep waking up with anxiety.  The alprazolam works in the first 20 minutess but my anxiety gets a little worse when I take it and then it gets so much better!  The downside is the bad taste, causes drowsiness, loss of appetite and weight, and is highly addictive.  Great for temporary relief!""",7
Minocycline,Acne,"""honestly it worked for a while, but after 5/6 months, it completely stopped working. my breakouts were even worse than before. i soon stopped taking the required dosage. finally, i decided to go back to my dermatologist and he told me to take it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. however, once again, it worked for a month or so, and then my breakouts happened again. I don&#039;t even know what to do anymore, acne is so stressful and i&#039;m so self-conscious because of it. i was praying that this medication and treatment would work, but it didn&#039;t. i&#039;ve tried almost everything and nothing has worked.""",4
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on so many drugs I lost count and cannot remember all the names. Lamictal has really improved my life. My mood swings have diminished and my depressive episodes have nearly gone away. I have a couple of year now and they don&#039;t last nearly as long. I also don&#039;t get suicidal anymore. So much gratitude for this medication. I&#039;m on 100 mg right now and when I had my last depressive episode my doctor wanted me to increase my dose but it has a tendency to make me feel out of it and unable to experience any range of emotion really. I just try to make it through the depressive episodes instead.""",6

Itching where applied, seems to subside the longer you wear it. Gets red, irritated in that spot. Alternate hips. NO APPETITE until medicine wore off. I served breakfast at 4am to get 3 meals a day. Dinner 1 1/2 - 2 hours after removing patch and lunch if you want to call it that around 8am. It was worth it to me to save my sanity. Patch does take 2 hrs to kick in.

Tomorrow I am going to start a 10 day break in hopes that when I start back up it will be as effective as the first month.  I&#039;ve got another 40 to go, so hopefully it works.

The big difference is noticing that I have no appetite for food at all and no cravings for anything! Forget about 3 meals a day, I am thinking about maybe only doing one or very little at each meal. I can understand why my appetite is suppressed because the drug is supposed to play games with your brain, well I guess it is working just fine.

I have been on the 4 pill dose for a week, but it&#039;s made me so nauseous, I decided to cut back to 1 in the am and 2 in the pm and see if that helps.  I have not weighed myself (scale is not working), but will get weighed when I go back to the doctor on June 1st.  It doesn&#039;t really make me feel any differently other than the nausea, but that is preventing me from eating a lot.  It does help if I eat something small first thing in the morning, but I feel so sick, I don&#039;t want to.  I&#039;m hoping cutting back for a week will help.""",2
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have been talking Vyvanse for just a week. 40mg. The first 3 days I couldn&#039;t sit down. I cleaned my house and my parents. Not just cleaned but extra clean, like walls and moving furniture and everything. But now it has faded a little. I noticed right away that when I am doing stuff, its like I really concentrate and try perfection for everything. My appetite has been curved, but I still eat. But no where like I did before. So far I lost 4pds. It&#039;s been almost a week. I don&#039;t get any feeling of jitters, or that I&#039;m taking speed. I feel normal, I just want to do stuff. I&#039;m more social. I always stayed in my home, but now I just want to go out. It&#039;s very nice feeling. I have no problems sleeping either, but I also take it as soon as I wake up""",1
Risperdal,Bipolar Disorde,"""This was the WORST drug I have been on since I was diagnosed in 1998. I was on the injection for about six months, gained a lot of weight (50 pounds) and had a horrible gallstones flare up in which I was diagnosed with the condition (after fainting in public). I was put back on abilify and prefer the oral pill every day to the injection! One nurse didn&#039;t inject me correctly and I developed sciatica for longer than I was on the medication!!""",6
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I have had trouble falling asleep for years. Prosom works well for me. My doctor wanted me to start alternating so I do not build up a tolerance so last night I tried 15mg of belsomra . In my opinion it is NOT for the people who cannot FALL asleep. I felt very tired(a natural tired, yawning like crazy) my body wanted to fall asleep but as usual my brain was not having it. After 1 1/2 hours of laying trying to    fall asleep, I took the one last xanex I had and fell asleep 20 minutes later. I did however sleep soundly and wanted to sleep longer when I woke to my alarm. I had no side effects but I do feel tired starting my work day but the tiredness is wearing off. This may be worth a try for people who cant stay asleep.""",0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got my Kyleena IUD inserted about 4 months ago. I heard very mixed experiences on whether or not insertion hurt - and for me it was extremely painful. I had pretty bad cramping and had to avoid exercise for about 3-4 days after insertion, which wasn&#039;t too bad. For the past 2 months I have been experiencing the worst cramps EVER that come at very random times. I have never given birth before, but I often think that these cramps must be what contractions feel like. I&#039;ve had ultrasounds and I have been told that the IUD has not shifted or anything, so the cause of the cramps is unknown. I&#039;m hoping they go away because I don&#039;t know how long I can take it!!""",8
Duac,Acne,"""At 35 years old I thought i was over &#039;teenage acne&#039; and my recent issues were hormonal. Over the past few of years I&#039;ve used every face wash possible!
I go on holiday in 2 weeks and had the worst break out ever! I didn&#039;t want to go on holiday looking like a child&#039;s dot to dot book, so I visited my doctor who gave me this gel.
I&#039;ve used it for only 3 nights and the spots are already 5 times better than they were! The red blotches from previous spots are also pretty much vanished.
Yes its left my face dry and a bit tight, so make sure you use a good quality moisturiser once you&#039;ve washed the gel off your face in the morning. I&#039;d recommend reapplying moisturisturiser a couple of times through the day. Looking forward to seeing the full results!""",4
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I have suffered with anxiety and panic attacks since I was 7. I&#039;m currently 33 and just discovered Klonopin. I was on Paxil for 12 years and it was a miracle pill until I built tolerance to it and it stopped working. I&#039;ve recently switched to Zoloft and it&#039;s been a rough road. However my psychiatrist put me on klonopin to help ease the anxiety and it has been amazing. I only need .25 mg 2 to 3 times a day, but it gave me the ability to function. Even with withdrawal from Paxil and start up side effects from Zoloft, I can still keep my head straight. Anxiety and panic are dibilatating and when I weigh my options, I&#039;d pick klonopin everytime.""",7
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""If I could give this poorly tested &quot;medicine&quot; a 0 rating, I would.  This medication damn near killed me.  I had a reaction referred to as akethisia, I felt like my insides were in constant need to motion, the only thing that would somewhat calm it was aggressive pacing back and forth, I couldn&#039;t lift my arms, and I had trouble speaking due to twitching of my diaphragm. I almost killed myself to get away from these horrible feelings.  Abilify also caused permanent damage to my diaphragm and I will randomly not be able to talk without my voice fluctuating from the twitching diaphragm.  My advice would be to try a different drug if yours isn&#039;t working, There&#039;s no point in adding a second chemical to &quot;boost&quot; your other one. .""",5
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""Well, it only took 33 years for me (and a good doctor), to figure out what was wrong with me. I have had unexplained tachycardia (did EKGs and no problems, although never during an episode) since about age 8-9, I&#039;ve had episodes of fainting, syncope, almost fainting, fatigue, being hyper and crashing. ADD symptoms, depression, mania. I have been treated for Depression and Mania, 3 years ago, and came oh so close to a solution, but the wrong meds made it even worse. Took 2 years to recover. Until, I got a new doctor, who treated my ADD and after two failed attempts to tolerate Adderall and Ritalin, prescribed Straterra, in the first 40 minutes I tool 25mg, my ADD symptoms subsided, and ALL other symptoms have resolved.""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed about 8 months ago with ADHD and am 31 years old. I always knew that something wasn&#039;t quite right, but growing up the teachers just told my parents that I was a &quot;social butterfly&quot; and wasn&#039;t interested in school. When I went to college I just stuck with classes that I knew information about. I am currently taking a class that I really have no interest or knowledge in and it&#039;s AMAZING.

Minocycline,Acne,"""I am 18 and have had acne for a couple years, after going to the dermatologist a second time I was prescribed Minocycline. I&#039;ve been taking it for almost two weeks along with a cream. This last week I&#039;ve had severe headaches, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. After reading other reviews with the same side effects and this prescription leading to long term issues I would not suggest taking this.""",4
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My son is currently on 20mgs once a day. Diagnosed and medicated September 2016. We noticed he does this blank stare where his eyes roll up and makes a tasting motion with his mouth. I notified Dr and he had a EEG done. Turns out they were seizures. He is doing super well in school, complete 180 but I don&#039;t think  it worth it. He&#039;s now on liquid keppra. I feel like has just going down hill. Super irritable, mood swings which they said was a side effect of being on both. Very disheartening. Waiting for MD to call back to change his med to a non stimulant.""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""This medicine has changed my life.  I am a 43 year old female, diagnosed as an adult with ADHD.  I always knew I was meant for more than what I seemed capable of achieving - although I would by no means consider myself an underachiever. The statement &quot;you don&#039;t know what you don&#039;t know&quot; rings so true for me.  Immediately upon starting this prescription my world changed.  I was able to fully complete tasks, stay on schedule, CONCENTRATE, and prioritize...the list goes on and on.  I wish I had a &quot;before and after&quot; photo of my home.  The clutter, disorganization, and chaos is gone.  My house very much symbolizes my brain.  I feel like my mind has been freed from the &quot;fog&quot;, and I am able to accomplish so much more now with much less stress.""",1
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Started yesterday. IR 300mg 3x daily. 
Within thirty minutes, I&#039;m laughing with joy, unbelievable!

Cured.

Years of zyprexa, abilify, Celexa, depakote, Ativan, etc, and.. Wow.

I can finally admit it. I have bipolar disorder. 

Nothing else. Not anxiety. Calm. Quiet and calm head. No depression  or mania. I want to feel and look my best all the time.

And it only took a naturally occurring element, abundant in our universe.. To flip the switch.

Although there is no cure. Just how I feel.""",6
Clonidine,ADHD,"""My son is 6 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD, ODD, Aspergers syndrome, and possible bipolar disorder. We have tried so many medications, Ritalin, Adderall, Focalin XR, Risperadal, Seroquel, and regular Clonidine. He is now taking 300 mg of Trazadone which doesn&#039;t help, 15 mg of Abilify, and Kapvay. I&#039;ve spaced the three medications out but he still wakes up at 9 am and goes to bed at 3 am. I am at a loss right now because the psychiatrist says he&#039;s limited as to what he can put him on but the Trazadone I swear seems to wire him up. He&#039;s wide awake as I am writing this post. The Kapvay does make him cranky and irritable during the afternoon, any advice please.""",1
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had mild acne ever since I was 11 but it started to get MUCH MUCH worse when I hit 15. So at 15 I went to a dermatologist and was prescribed tretion 0.025 cream, I didn&#039;t have a Initial purge phase, but I did have really dry/peeling skin for the first month. I was using it for about 6 months, it worked miracles for my skin! it took about two months to really kick in. But then my tube of the cream got thrown away by accident and I was off of it for three weeks. My skin got worse than it initially was within that time, two months after that and I was seeing no results so I went back to my derm and got prescribed the 00.5 cream. I&#039;ve been on it for two months now and my skin is mainly clear again. This cream does work. Give it time.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""1st update... I&#039;m beginning week 2 on Phentermine and I&#039;m very pleased thus far! I lost 7 lbs in week 1 bringing me down from 179 to 172.

Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m confused about comments. Do most bi- polar 1 patients find Geodon taken before sleep helps sleeplessness? I have been taking Geodon the last 6 months and weaned myself off of lithium. The only side affect I have with Geodon is sleeplessness. Is Geodon more effective taken in the evening? I see my Dr.in a month, I will bring up patient responses to Geodon,taken before bedtime. I&#039;m willing to try! """,6
Adderall,ADHD,"""I was put on Ritalin when I was 6. I did not like it. I took myself off of it when I was 14. My grades plummeted, I developed depression, and then anxiety. I continued to become lethargic, and relied heavily on caffeine. I am now 25. I began to take Adderall recently due to severe trouble concentrating at work, thinking it may help me keep my job. Now that my body seems to be used to the medication I can hardly tell I&#039;m on it. I have noticed improved memory, focus, and concentration. I did have some very adverse side effects accidentally combining with caffeine. I&#039;ve found now that my body has adjusted I have no side effects and my concentration remains improved, and bonus, no depression. I do worry about cessation.""",1
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I started on May 19 with the free trial and was taking 2 pills a day, (morning &amp; night). My insurance won&#039;t pay for it, so it&#039;s $75 a month per refill. First day I had a little trouble focusing on things in the distance &amp; was pretty sleepy the first week. After the 2 week trial, I decided I was going to do just one pill a day, in the morning. As far as losing the weight, I started on Tuesday and we left for the beach on Friday for the weekend. I actually gained about 5 lbs but once we got home and I got serious about my eating habits, I lost the 5lbs &amp; have lost another 3lbs. I don&#039;t crave sugar as bad as I used to, but it still tastes pretty good to me when I eat it. If I eat slowly and pay attention to what I&#039;m doing, I fill fuller faster""",3

I recently went vegan because I felt so nasty all of the time I needed a change in diet and life style to try and lose some weight. Well instead of losing weight, I gained. 30lbs to be exact...in as little as 4 months. That is such a rapid weight gain that I now have stretch marks on my hips and thighs!

Cymbalta,Pain,"""I have been on Cymbalta for 2 months and it has really help my back pain.  I have had chronic back pain for 3 years due to a fall.   I have had my back MRI and I have no disks problems, so it is muscle pain.  Cymbalta has really helped.   It does still bother me some days but not as much as before.
In the beginning I had a lot of nausea with Cymbalta but that went away after about a week, I was determined to give it a chance.  With some of the side effects it is easy to give up, but it does get better.  Now I have no problems, maybe a little less of an appetite, but that might not be such a bad thing.""",9
Effexor XR,Depression,"""Effexor was a mixed bag for me -  it was very numbing, and the side effects (which lingered for years after I stopped taking it) were awful. I attempted suicide a few weeks after starting it, because I was still depressed but was more numbed to the guilt I would usually feel. Be careful of this, make sure someone is aware if you feel at risk. It took a few months, but I began to feel positive things again, but eventually I was stuck in a zombie state where the side effects outweighed the good. I tried it on a few occasions with the same result: taking myself off them because I wanted to feel again. The best advice I can give is to see a psychiatrist, not a GP. There is a range of medicines, make sure you get the one that is tailored to YOU.""",5

I have taken it less than a week and I have an appointment to see the doctor tomorrow.  If I stop taking this, will I have withdrawal symptoms?  Or should I do this gradually?  My gallbladder symptoms are gone and my body feels great after the surgery.  Any suggestions?""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I started taking Ambien about 3 years ago.  When I first took it I did make the random phone calls and would eat in my sleep but it worked.  I only took it when I absolutely needed to.  I stopped for about a year then the insomnia started again and I took it again and the side effects weren&#039;t there.

Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""This stuff is terrible! I have been on it for a very long time and had a lot of side effects like weight gain but the worst one was the dry mouth. I would drink 4 bottles of water every night and eat hard candy and spend most of my time in the bathroom.  I also wanted to eat everything in sight.

I was prescribed Clonazepam and it has been a God-send. Not being able to sleep normally had a terrible affect on my daily life.

Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and was given Lexapro along with cognitive therapy. The first week Lexapro made me worse than I was originally. However, it worked wonders and has helped me immensely to get my life back in order.  I started on a light dosage at 10mg and in 4 weeks jumped to 20mg which is typical.  This combined with cognitive therapy has got me back on track.  I really didn&#039;t experience any side effects except feeling crappy when I first got on it.  Within 4 weeks it was fine.  To me it is like taking aspirin everyday now.""",7
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I have been prescribed this for that last year and a 1/2. From day 1 I have had the same effects from it, which is good. I do not seem to be showing any signs of &quot;addiction&quot; or need to have the amount increased, the downfall for me is with it I can sleep about 4 - 5 hours (which is great compared to what I used to do), however it doesn&#039;t help me fall asleep at all, so I&#039;ll lay there up to 2 hours before I finally drop.""",0
Kyleena,Birth Control,"""The first 2 months were wonderful, my periods were lighter and I loved not having to remember to take a pill everyday. The 3rd month hit and everything went downhill. They say the adjustment period is usually 3 months and after that you shouldn&#039;t get any symptoms. A week and a half before my 3rd cycle was to begin I woke up feeling nauseous and had vertigo. At first I didn&#039;t think anything of it because my body is quite sensitive as it is, but then it happened the next morning and the next and now I&#039;m into my fourth month, I&#039;ve missed 2 weeks of work, I can no longer consume solid food and my bowel movements are extremely abnormal. I finally secured an appointment and will be removing it in 2 days. If you&#039;re sensitive to hormones, beware!""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""My Anxiety symptoms before Lexapro
I was always paranoid of people judging me and just wasn&#039;t myself because I always felt panicked.  I would socially isolate myself from friends and family, which then drove me into depression.  My anxiety inhibited myself from learning and grasping new knowledge because I was too anxious to even learn.  Even doing the smallest tasks (paying bills) would cause an overwhelming amount of anxiety.

Now (after 4 weeks on 10 mg)
- I&#039;m mellow, feel confident. Someone I just met pegged me as an intellect! God knows how long anxiety has made me doubt my intelligence.

Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have taken Abilify for around 5-6 years. I initially was prescribed it at the age of 15 which is way too early in my opinion.

Don&#039;t try and get off this drug on your own, it can have horrible consequences. I&#039;m not totally sure what was the Abilify withdrawal and what was my illness, but I had some very extreme mania, that may have been a side effect of withdrawal. Overall Abilify is a very serious drug, don&#039;t take it lightly, and I wouldn&#039;t recommend it for depression.

Moved on to Gabapentin in last 48 hours which has seen back pain return but no sciatic pain or tightness. I am allergic/have a bad intolerance to caffeine and it was exactly the same reaction.

I could not work, I lost down to 95 pounds. I was so weak I had difficulty climbing stairs. I shook so bad I could not sign my own name. Then my doctor started to add all sorts of medicines to counteract the side effects. I became hypothyroid had to take medicines for that, tremor had to take medicines for that (didn&#039;t work well). Dr. decreased dose (didn&#039;t help much). I was on leave from work for 12 weeks.

Just do not get addicted. IMO max 1-2 mg for max 1 mth. 2 year user. 27 yo male. Kills anxiety in it&#039;s tracks but not to be used long term. Look into Nardil/Parnate if SSRIs fail. Asenapine is great if you need your racing thoughts controlled. DO NOT LET ANY PSYC GIVE THIS TO YOU LONG TERM""",6
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I have been on Lunesta for approximately 10 years. Lunesta has it&#039;s ups and downs, but my doctor suggested trying something that was not a hypnotic. So, I stopped Lunesta for one month and went on 15, and then 20 mg of Belsomra. As best I can describe it, the Beslomra was interesting. Interesting, in that when I could fall asleep, it did feel much more natural. I would also wake up in the morning feeling tired and just wanting to lay in bed and relax. That is not a bad thing. However, it simply would not put me to sleep on most nights. Moreover, the tiredness feeling I experienced tended to linger all day. It was not a drugged feeling, but just a tiredness I could not shake.  So, I went back to Lunesta.  Not perfect, but does it&#039;s job well!""",0

When it would wear off I was extremely hostile and agitated. The side effects seemed to outweigh the benefits. So far Trileptal has left me with no side effects except for a slight headache and I have smoothly transitioned out of my manic episode.

Adderall,ADHD,"""This is the most amazing medicine. I&#039;ve had problems with being unmotivated, overweight and depressed for years, and this drug can make me feel like a new person. Unfortunately, I&#039;m stuck taking these pills just so I can feel productive. Oddly, though, sometimes even when I&#039;m not on the drug, I feel as if I&#039;m moving in fast motion, but my brain isn&#039;t. It&#039;s very strange but I can deal with it.""",1
Belviq,Obesity,"""I started taking belviq twice a day faithfully , first week no change in appetite ,cravings or weight. Second week I felt like I gained weight still no change in appetite ,GAINED 3 LBS. So upset after spending $88.00,I abruptly stopped and made Dr. Aware. She never said to wean off. Within 2 days major withdraw, Had abdominal cramping, nausea and vomiting all night until I took another pill. Then decided for the next 4 days to slowly wean off which I did. This is a strong as medication. Don&#039;t stop abruptly! Didn&#039;t work for me.""",2
Bupropion,Depression,"""Took 150 mg for 4 days and suddenly stating feeling weakness, aches, pains,  then sore throat accompanied by fever called my Dr she made me stop taking it and was given toradol to break fever of 102.8 and steroids and fluids, went from 216 to 213 pounds in 4 days. Had my heart rate and blood pressure up also.  This drug may be for others but definitely not me, too many adverse effects I&#039;ve tried zoloft, Prozac, and lexapro, anti depressents are not for me""",5
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Implanon now for about 2 and half years now and I&#039;m still getting my periods. They started off normal &amp; now they are just irregular. I&#039;ve had my period now for the past three weeks now and it&#039;s not normal period blood it&#039;s more brown and chunky than anything I&#039;ve experienced before. I&#039;m not the type to go to the Drs. but it&#039;s getting to the point where it&#039;s ruining my sex life. I never had depression or weight loss or gained any but I do get less headaches then what I did before. I would recommend the Implanon to people who are forgetful about taking pills it&#039;s just risky because the symptoms are different for everyone.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on Contrave for a month and a half now, and I am down 23 Lbs.  I would always enjoy a cocktail or two when I came home from work and felt like I needed it to unwind, but this has totally changed that feeling.  I don&#039;t have a desire to drink, and my appetite is definitely decreased.  This morning I was down at 216.  Two minor side effects I have experienced.  1. I get a feeling of nausea which discourages me from eating, and 2.  I have been getting head aches all day.  Both well worth the results!""",2
Vistaril,Anxiety,"""My experience with it.  The medicine works great for itch relief (pruritis) and anxiety.  I have Graves Disease, this was to treat anxiety temporarily after thyroid storm.  The problem I had with it was it made me to doped feeling to function normally.  I stayed tired and experienced grumpiness and lack of patience.  I&#039;ve taken Xanax, and Elavil before and definitely was able to work, socialize normally unlike this medicine, there is no way I can take it every four to six hours and function throughout the day. I&#039;ve never been one to tolerate antihistamines very well, I get the shakes etc., and  experienced the same with the Vistaril.  All that aside, at night it did help me sleep, help the anxiety as it&#039;s supposed too.""",7
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Acne, acne scars, blemishes, etc. I&#039;ve been suffering from acne since I was 16 years old. I used to put on cheap products from Walgreens or CVS.  When I turned 22 my acne became worse. I suffered from cystic acne. I went to a dermatologist for low income students and she prescribed Tretinoin (she started with a lower percentage) My acne disappeared in 8 months. I&#039;ve been using this Tretinoin for 11 months (0.05) and I don&#039;t have to wear make up anymore! 
I also alternate and use Proactiv but ONLY the  I wash my face with a cheaper brand from CVS that has Benzoyl Perixide 10% Then, the pore targetting treatment. Last step (moisturize) 
 
Moisturize before and after the medication for better results. 

Be patient :) Don&#039;t touch your face!""",4
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""My experience has been mirrored by another recent poster; I got mine I  mid-November 2014. I had two very light periods and then mid-January 2015, I started a period that hasn&#039;t stopped for more than 18 hours. I&#039;ve been spotting for more than three months straight! 
I can still work out, I drink plenty of water and eat good food, and the cramps have only been bad once or twice (after a nap I was ok). I think staying hydrated and eating a diet rich in protein will help some of the symptoms others experience. I&#039;ve lost about 15 lbs (neither hindered or helped by the device), been a little moody and had a very mild increase in acne.""",8
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 16 years old, and I&#039;ve just recently started taking Vyvanse. I just started taking a new pill for my depression. Zoloft, which started helping. But I could notice a HUGE difference with Vyvanse right away. I am much more talkative, been in a better mood, less lazy, and I actually don&#039;t mind cleaning my room every now and then. I used to fight with my boyfriend all the time about things, which I now realize should have been no big deal at all. But now, things have changed. I&#039;m excited for school, even because I want to see if Vyvanse will help me bring up my grades and concentrate better, instead of falling asleep in class. Some side effects I&#039;ve noticed though is not having an appetite, and talking too much.""",1
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Ive been in recovery from opiods for 14 months( which my dr prescribed for chronic hip bursitis. worse thing ever), anyways,I take 15mg of remeron and sleep like a rock. I take it 1 hr before bed, and I don&#039;t wake up once in the night. I used to toss and turn from pain every 1hour and woke up exhausted.  Now I sleep straight through and my anxiety is gone.  I never considered myself a depressed person, but I can say my mood is even better.  If you cant sleep, I would def recommend this!""",0
Naproxen,Pain,"""I heard/felt something in my shoulder tear ( Torn tendon in shoulder ). Went to Dr when ibuprofen and paracetamol no longer worked. Prescribed 500mg naproxen twice day. This was last wed. It&#039;s now Sunday and the constant dull pain down my arm has come back. The naproxen worked really well for about 48 hours. It didn&#039;t stop the agony every morning. Painful when changing gear when driving (UK). Have MRI scan in 10 days. No side effects although my hot flushes ( menopause) seem to have got much worse over the last 2 days ( on clonidine for those)""",9
Adapalene,Acne,"""2 weeks into the treatment, first week was awful, burning redness peeling more pimples. Slowly improved I&#039;m feeling a lot better still a little bit of peeling and dry skin and a pimple here and there but it doesn&#039;t burn anymore. They say 8 weeks others 3 months to see results so although it&#039;s too early to say that differin won the battle I have to say that I&#039;m satisfied. Also I use Clinique bar soap in the morning, Clinique acne cream, and tonic. And at night just st Ives scrub and differin. I wear my regular make up revlon but I want to switch to Clinique. It doesn&#039;t hold all day my skin starts to get itchy in the evening. Just be patient!""",4
Viibryd,Depression,"""Started on 10mg of Viibryd and have been taking it for over 6 weeks.
First week I experienced being &quot;spacey&quot;, diarrhea and no appetite.  After the first week, I started to feel better and have improved quite a bit.  Anxiety is gone but still have &quot;anger&quot; issues, although not as bad prior to Viibryd. 
Asking the doctor to up the dosage to 20mg to possible help with anger issues.
Otherwise, Viibryd is about the best anti-depressant I&#039;ve ever taken.  Much better than Wellbutrin/Zoloft/Prozac/Celexa/etc.""",5
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I have been on this medicine now for almost 10 years now, until recently, I&#039;ve only had tolerable minor side effects, sweats and itching. Besides it relieving the pain, it is great because there are only a few other meds that it had bad interactions with (and grapefruit, the grapefruit kept the pain meds from working). Unfortunately after being on it so long, my body has gotten too used to it and no longer works for me and it has started to make my feet, ankles and calves swell. I still highly recommend Dilaudid to any one. Besides the pain relief, the withdrawals from Dilaudid are not that bad to go through.""",9
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""this is the most amazing thing I have ever used. I suffer from a panic disorder, and 2 months ago I stated 10mg ciraplax. I now only have 1 panic attack every two weeks whereas i was having 2-3 a day. I dont sweat the small stuff anymore and overall have a better quality of life. only long term side effect I have experienced is complete loss of appetite, and noticeable weight loss (was 5&#039;7 and 118lbs before starting medication, so weight loss isn&#039;t beneficial). other then that no noticeable side effects. amazing medication, 100% recommend for anyone suffering from debilitating anxiety""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Love this medicine! Tried all the others, Vyvanse definitely works the best. I stay on task, focused, more organized and been moving up in my field. 29 yr old female, 30mg dose. The only negative is if I don&#039;t take it for a day or 2 on the weekends then start again is at first it makes me real jittery and makes me go to the bathroom until my bowels are essentially cleaned out, but that&#039;s really not a bad thing. Also I love the way it curbs my appetite and keeps me around 115 lbs without even trying(I&#039;m 5&#039;3&quot;). A very pleasant side effect!! I was on 70 mg a couple years ago but I was getting a little too skinny(stable around 106-108 lbs), so decreased the dosage.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Phentermine 6 weeks ago. I have only lost 6 lbs. However, I feel like I&#039;m on an emotional roller-coaster and I&#039;m not sure if it is because of the medication. Some days I just want to cry for no reason at all. It also makes me sleepy. Not jittery. I have always had trouble sleeping so I can&#039;t say it has caused my insomnia. It does make you not hungry though. I have to remind myself to eat. Sex drive seems to be disappearing too. """,3
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Sexanda now for a little over 3 weeks.  24 days to be exact.  I have lost 7 pounds to date.  The first week was awful for me.  I experienced terrible headaches, nausea, heartburn and insomnia.  I was hesitant to continue the drug as I felt terrible.  I spoke to my doctor who advised me not to up my dose the second week so I continued taking Saxenda at 0.6 for 2 weeks.  Miraculously, my side effects lessened up by the 10th day and I was happy I didn&#039;t stop.  I just increased my dose to the 1.2 and feel some nausea and a slight headache once again but no where near as bad as previously. My doctor said everyone&#039;s tolerance level is different and as long as I am losing I could go back down to .06. No need to increase if losing.""",3
Kyleena,Birth Control,"""I had kyleena inserted two weeks ago.  I&#039;m 20.  No children.  I took a xanax about 45 mins before the procedure and it was over very quickly. The pain was a 7-8 out of 10 but only lasted for a minute. The most unpleasant part was the startling awareness of the feeling of the device in my uterus. I didn&#039;t take any pain medicine after,  just ate some ice cream and took a nap. I have brown discharge on a daily basis, and from what I&#039;ve read this should go away soon. I&#039;ve never had acne, but I am currently dealing with a rough breakout (8 bumps appeared on the same day). Also dealing with uterus spams that come and go but are not painful... feels like uterus is shaking...""",8
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have been taking this drug for about 4 years.  Went in depression anxiety, and chronic insomnia.  I take 5 mg when I do take it and it works very well for me.  I have never experienced any of the horror stories that others have.  It immediately improved my mood, depression and anxiety as it finally allowed me to sleep.  I try not to take it more than 3 times a week to avoid dependency on it.  Sometimes I go weeks without it, sometimes 2 weeks straight on it due to situational anxiety.""",0
Flurazepam,Insomnia,"""With all benzodiazepines you tend to build a tolerance which is why it is only recommended for short term insomnia treatment or to be taken as needed. I do have to say that when used as needed this medicine hit me like a mac truck and I would sleep 8 hours plus. My anxiety and insomnia both much improved. No hallucinations or late night grazing like with those so called &quot;non-addictive&quot; &quot;non-narcotic&quot; sleep aids. Word of advice. Make sure you take if you can sleep for at least 8 hours and set multiple alarms.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I was officially diagnosed with ADHD around age 28 but it wasn&#039;t until 30 that I decided to try medication. I started with Vyvanse. Holy crap! It was amazing. I hadn&#039;t realized how much noise went on in my head until it was quiet. Then I could have linear thought patterns. For the first time ever my life started to come together. I could see tasks in processes, I could think clearly, I could manage my emotions. It was amazing. Then the side effects kicked in. My dr and I went through every other adhd medication there was and nothing helped. I did more research and found that my problem was that all of the medications use dyes which gave me flu like symptoms. Vyvanse uses the most dyes so made me the sickest. I now take it out of capsule.""",1
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""My doctor told me he takes 50mg to help me sleep while his mind relaxes after a stressful day so I have been on the same dosage for almost a month now.  It really works for me.  I have bladder problems and been dealing with being very anxious about some other issues as well.  I have less trouble falling asleep and my mind pays less attention to the call of the bathroom.  At one time I was getting up 5 or more times and now I get up about 2 times a night.  I am getting more deep sleep and feeling more rested when I get up.""",0
Aviane,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Aviane for 11 days now, starting the 1st pill in the pack the first day my period started (Sunday). I&#039;ve now had my period a full 11 days and it&#039;s starting to get really annoying. My sex drive has decreased a bit, I have vaginal itching, burning and redness, and I find myself becoming frequently dizzy. My breasts have become extra sensitive and seem much fuller than normal, my acne/ clearing of face seems the same as before taking the pill, but my mood swings have been the worst. One moment I want to cry, the next moment I&#039;m cheerful and happy towards everyone. """,8
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed with bipolar II about 5 yrs ago and I&#039;ve tried everything on the market nothing worked for me except Seroquel. Right now I take 300 mg twice per day and I&#039;m so stable. I&#039;m loving it problem though with Seroquel is that its a major weight gainer. I would stop taking it on and off when I felt better but then would use other meds to bandage my symptoms...get back on then off again...until one day I decided to stop with the denial and allow someone to help me for real. I&#039;ve been on it now faithfully for 9 months...but I&#039;ve put on 60lbs! It makes me eat after hours in the middle of the night. I&#039;m depressed because of the weight gain. So I workout at home at times trying to be more consistent. You have to work this medicine.""",6
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Last year my oldest daughter who is now 9yrs old was diagnosed with ADD and the doctor put her on Aderrall but within a week took her off and right away put her on Vyvanse 30mg. It worked perfect for a while but now have to get her dosage raised because it wears off after only a few hours although the upside is that her grades have improved tremendously and now I also have an 8 yr old who was also diagnosed with ADHD and is also taking Vyvanse 30 mg and I&#039;ve noticed a real positive change in her concentration and her mood. I love it because she is also doing so much better in school.""",1
Ritalin LA,ADHD,"""Worked great from day one. Unfortunately, does not come in a generic form so can be very expensive. My doctor recently switched me to Methylin ER since it comes in a generic form and is much more affordable.  Sometimes I can&#039;t even tell I have taken the Methylin ER, the performance is so sub-standard to the Ritalin LA.  I am starting to think a normal life might just be worth the extra $60 a month my insurance doesn&#039;t cover on the Ritalin LA.""",1
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started Adipex two days ago. I&#039;m 21 years old 5&#039; tall and weigh 158lbs. According to my BMI and my doctors visit I am at the breaking point of obesity. I have had many struggles in the past with getting back to my goal weight of 105-110 and decided to give Adipex a shot. Obesity runs in my family and I hope to stop the cycle. I haven&#039;t had any side effects so far except for occasional dry mouth so I just drink water which is good anyway. I have had a great experience so far with increased energy and a suppressed appetite. I want to keep up with at least exercising for 30min a day and eating better and hopefully I will see results at the end of month one. I want to be at my goal weight which is a loss of about 50lbs in around 8 months. Wish me luck!""",3
Morphine,Pain,"""I have had 7 surgeries, 5 lower back, 2 neck fusions and still have 5 herniated discs in my thoracic spine.  Avinza with 10/325 has been a Godsend. I also have muscle spasm throughout my back at all times.  I have been taking 120mg every 12 hours with the Percocet for breakthrough pain.  Add muscle relaxers and I still had pain but could function.  My biggest problem was my last surgery the hospital didn&#039;t have any so they had to work out an equal dosage of Dilaudid.  It worked but I was far better with my Avinza.  I only wish the hospital would allow you to bring your own, they can administer it. """,9
Trazodone,Anxiety,"""They took me off valium after taking it for anxieties from a severe Traumatic brain injury while in the military. Now with there new rules they put me on trazodone for anxiety and wow its the worst thing a person can take. Read about all the dangers about the side effects from ssri&#039;s they are killing american vets especially. Please if you read this don&#039;t ever take a SSRI. I have done a lot of reading and found that antidepressants are horrible for a person. Even the scientist have said they made a mistake and they are not able to test the serotonin in a persons brain. So basically you are a guinea pig. They don&#039;t work and your addiction means no more sex!!! How can the drug companies make such a pill to help people when there the worst drug a person can take.""",7
Adderall,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve gone through most of my adult life not knowing that I have ADHD. After finding that I had literally every single symptom. As my doctor said, Whoa!  You&#039;re off the chart here! I&#039;ve been taking 20mg for a month now. Some of my symptoms bother me. Forgetting what I was talking about mid sentence, going into a room forgetting what I was there for. All in all though, I call this medicine a miracle. I hate thinking about how much of my life I&#039;ve missed out on before this. I was in school to be a Pharmacy Tech. I dropped out within a month, because I just couldn&#039;t keep up, or focus. I feel good now. My insurance at first weren&#039;t filling it. My doctor had to call the insurance co, they approved it for a year.

My doctors appointment to check how this medicine dosage is working. I think I need to go up a bit. I don&#039;t have annoying side effects""",1
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""I have been dealing with a high-conflict court battle on and off for 8 years. Two years ago I went to my Doctor because the stress was getting so bad my hair started falling out (adrenals depleted, onto hypothyriodism - what a mess). He put me on Zoloft which I only stayed on until I could go off. I wasn&#039;t depressed I was panicked, anxiety attacks, palpitations, etc., have no idea why he put me on Zoloft instead of Valium. Well we started our next round of court battles since I guess the ex isn&#039;t done annihilating me yet and same thing, panic, irritability, unable to think straight, thoughts swirling. A friend gave me a few 10mg Valiums and I couldn&#039;t believe how much they helped. I could actually THINK without freaking out! Awesome.""",7
Minocycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m not perfect with my eating and exercising habits and alas, along with teenage hormones came acne. They&#039;re not horrific, but bad enough to be irritating and painful the week before menstruation. I used to take doxycycline but, even from the beginning, it gave me really bad nausea and headaches. I haven&#039;t noticed anything too bad with the sun exposure on the minocycline but have had more drowsiness and am currently experiencing headaches and dizziness. It cleared up everything along with my use of a Clarisonic and a benzyl-based topical cream. Definitely try it if other tetracyclines didn&#039;t work out for you. This one, despite the side effects, is doing the trick.""",4
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I was skeptical. Read some reviews and they were so strong for or against. At first I did feel side effects. The first 3 weeks I thought there is no way I can take 4 a day. I listened to my body and waited an extra week to go up to full dose. The side effects of head ache and jittery had gone away by this point. I&#039;m 8 weeks in and I&#039;d say by week 5 I was feeling great! I&#039;m down 20lbs and less depressed. Food really doesn&#039;t matter """,3
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I am 40 years old and I have never taken a AD in my life, however I should have! I have a hip injury and picked up a addiction to opiates along the way! Luckily effexor has helped with the psychological effects of getting off of opiates! I know about all of the horror stories of AD but for me it was the best choice I could have made! I just returned to a very stressful job after a 2 year absence and I don&#039;t think my return to work would have been as successful without AD! During my 2 year slump I never used to leave the house, I slept all the time, used to cry at the thot of doing the dishes.....insanity! Luckily the only side effects that I had was the dry mouth and slight headaches in the beginning which went away!""",5
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I had been on Seroquel since 1997 and had gained a lot of weight.  I also had the side effects of type 2 diabetes, high cholestoral, etc. from taking it so long.  But Seroquel worked for me.  So in an effort to loose weight and the &quot;bad&quot; side effects I switched to Latuda.  Lutuda didn&#039;t do squat for me in the sleep department, so I ended up taking a half pill of Seroquel and a dose of Latuda.  This worked well for about a year.  I lost a ton of weight and my overall health improved.  However, I slipped into a major depressive episode in less than a year and had to go back to the &quot;tried and true&quot; Seroquel.  Feeling better, but gained back a lot of weight.  Never thought a drug marketed for BP depression would make me depressed.""",6

DO NOT TAKE THIS MED IF YOU&#039;RE ON  any kind of antidepressant!!! It will cause  you to start shaking your heart pounds you&#039;re dizzy sick and you could actually die from this! This med does nothing for my PAIN!  If you do take it with an antidepressant make sure you have a Narcan kit !!
God bless us who depend on these doctors!!""",9
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I was experiencing bad anxiety and was on cymbalta.  My Dr switched me to escitalopram and it did not help at all. I am still  on it and now on clonazapam. The clonaz helps my anxiety 100 percent but now my depression, especially the physical symptoms like over sleeping, not wanting to eat, diarrhea, full blown depression.  Cymbalta helped all of that so now I am seeing my Dr to go back on the Cymbalta, which really helps my depression and the physical pains of it, as well staying on clonazapam.  I feel like I&#039;m in a black hole and can&#039;t get out. It&#039;s scary. I want to shake it and I just can&#039;t.  See my Dr this Tuesday thank goodness.  Hope to feel better soon.""",5
Adderall,ADHD,"""I am a 43 old women going on to menopause. I was never diagnosed with attention deficient. As a child I could multitask anything. When I reached menopause stage it seems as though I could not remember things in general. I would forget to finish several thing I was doing.  My stepson does have attention deficient so he has been on it for some time.  I asked my doctor about the situation of my attention span forgetting not finish task. So he suggested for me to try Adderall. To my surprise, I was able to concentrate, focus on my daily activity.  So I do recommend this to any women going through this crazy menopause.  It really helps you to be yourself again. Not feel like you are going crazy.""",1
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Depakote since June of 2006. I was initially started off at 1000mg and am now up to 1500mg. When I told my neurologist I want off it she increased the dosage to 1500mg. I take it for Epilepsy but have had similar problems as you all. I am 24  years old and am now balding. I have decreased ambition and have difficulty with memory and paying attention. I have gained about 50 pounds since starting it. Last year when my prescription was raised from 1000 to 1500mg I noticed a 15 lb increase in about a month. I am however not having any seizures.""",6
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve had panic and anxiety really bad for 18 years. Some days where ok and other days where terrible . I forgot really what normal felt like. In 2012 it just got worse. Panic attacks every day.  I couldn&#039;t control it no more. I broke down and seeked help. My Dr put me on lexpro.  I was super scared at first to take it because of all the storys on the internet about it. I had a few side effects, but nothing to bad.  Best thing I ever did. Been on lexpro for over two years now and not one single panic attack. I feel like a totally normal person, it&#039;s great. My life improved 100%, and that&#039;s no lie.""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I have been taking 30mg of Vyvanse for one week now. It works great. The first day I could really feel the amphetamine and found it too strong and unpleasant but on day 2 I did not feel bad from it. It lasts long, probably 12-14 hours and is very smooth. The crash is relatively mild.
Previously I have been on dexamphetamine IR 3x10mg/day for one month which worked really well, but I wanted something that is sustained released. Before that I was on Ritalin IR and LA for over 15 years. The Methylphenidate just did not work as well as it used to and I found the side effects more and more unpleasant. 
I can really recommend Vyvanse so far. I am really calm from it and can focus very well on tasks. It also has less cardiac side effects than others.""",1
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""Just started Buspirone 10mg twice a day. For years I have been on Celexa, Bupropion, and Clonazepam. Those 3 worked for me, but my doc suggests instead of taking clonazepam daily, I should try Buspirone for long term use, &amp; clonazepam for when my panic attacks are truly out of control. 

So far the drug combination has had no major negative interactions. I take the Buspirone with food. The first 2 days in &amp; I had pretty bad headaches, about 2 weeks in now &amp; tonight I&#039;m having severe dizziness, which is making me nauseas. I&#039;m definitely going to keep going on them though.  I LOVE my clonazepam (klonopin). Its almost instant relief during an attack, but after reading about it extensively &amp; talking with my 2 docs, I&#039;m ready to get off of it.""",7
Victoza,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m going on my second week now. I had some burping and an over full bloated feeling that seems to have subsided. I also had a lil nausea at times but not bad. I had to force myself to eat the first week as well. Nothing sounded good. This coming Tuesday I go up to 1.8 dose. I though I was just imagining not being hungry because I like to eat but the fullness and over all lack of interest in food is awesome. Haven&#039;t weighed myself yet because I don&#039;t want to be discouraged, it&#039;s only been 2 weeks. Going to stick it out here&#039;s a tip, I bought Gas ex for the belching and tummy gas it helped a lot. Also don&#039;t eat late at night because what u eat is really slow to digest and it will keep u up at night. I do my shot at around 2 pm daily.""",3
OxyContin,Pain,"""As a pharmacy technician, the advice in this column recommends that unused portions of the drug should be flushed in the toilet.  This is an incorrect myth.

Belviq,Obesity,"""Tomorrow will end out my first full week on Belviq and since I read every single one of these reviews before asking my doctor for it, I thought I&#039;d better add mine to help the next person out. :) I&#039;m female, age 41, T2 diabetic. I started last week at 187 (5&#039;5&quot; tall) which puts my BMI at just over 30. I weight this morning (would have been five full days) and am down four pounds to 183!! I haven&#039;t lost my appetite by any means and could still easily overeat it I wanted to. What it has done for me is to help me feel full faster. It&#039;s still on me to make healthy choices, the difference is that now I can eat at appropriate portion and be satisfied. I have been averaging 1200 calories a day. No side effects for me. I&#039;m thrilled!!""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking adipex since january 7 and it is now march 13. I have lost 36 lbs. I exercise everyday for an hour of cardio, drink plenty of water, and watch my diet. I recommend it to anyone with a weight problem. I started at 305 and now at 269 lbs. Only side effect I feel is lots of energy and I get about 6 hours of sleep a night,which is good. It&#039;s a miracle pill with work and effort.""",3
Accutane,Acne,"""Well, it worked well for me. I took it back in the early 90&#039;s as a young teenager with moderate acne.  The side effects are bad though, really bad.  My skin was so dry, as were my lips and scalp.  I was sick, had a lot of pain and anxiety and then depression.  I took a 6 month course and it was recommended that I take a second about a year later but I couldn&#039;t face the idea of the side effects. It did, however, do miracles for my skin, it has remained clear some 20 yrs later.""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Claravis cured my severe acne by 98% within 6 months of use. I had bad red swollen and under the skin pimples, as well as blackheads, whiteheads, and little pimples all over for 4 years through middle school and some of high school. The only reason I didn&#039;t rate this a 10 is because of the side effects. To me, it was well worth it. I had SEVERE dry skin on my face, and burned easily in the sun. The worst side effect by far was dry lips and nose. My lips were constantly dry and cracking to the point of bleeding, I had to use vitamin E oil and finally found that Aquaphor worked well for lips and nose. Nostrils were dry, burning but only rarely cracked and bled. That was 6 years ago. I&#039;m 21 now and my acne never came back.""",4
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I decided to try this medication after a friend seemed to be losing weight on it. I&#039;m taking 2.4 mg and in week number 5.
I am an undereater anyway and never hungry so not sure this was the right medication for me. I thought it stabilized blood sugar? Hope it&#039;s not just an appetite suppressant  
I have lost 3lbs which is very disappointing. I will go up to 3mg today but if I don&#039;t lose anything again this week then I will probably stop... My question - anyone experience needing longer time and the full dose to start losing weight?""",2
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am honestly the happiest person ever since my Psychiatrist prescribed Depakote for me, NO MORE RAPID CYCLING!! I take two 500mg tablets about 20 minutes minutes before bed and I sleep throughout only waking up when my back aching in pain; I&#039;ll save that for my Baclofen and Prednisone post. I do not experience the manic highs as I was once did; however I still have my low days but everyone does! My low days are no where near the days when I on Trileptal or any SSRIs. I was taking Ability and Lithium for a week (this is my experience) I started seeing the world in two-dimensions, sort of like the early Nintendo characters. I freaking out!! That was it. Make sure to get blood tests every months to ensure your Depakote are in line. A  """,6
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I read a lot of reviews for trazodone on this web site. It has very different results for different people. I thought I would give my experience. My dosage is 200mg. It works extremely well at least 97% of the time. I experience no side effects. On the very rare occasion that I don&#039;t sleep, it&#039;s usually because of some other external reason, such as pain from a broken hip and leg from an earlier accident. I consider it a great medication for sleep since most other sleep meds have a quite large chance of becoming addictive. I hope this helps.""",0
Deplin,Depression,"""I want to I really say people should wait at least 3 months before they rate Deplin or any psychiatric medicine, unless you have some major horrible reaction. Deplin gave me a kick start the first week I took it for some reason but then the effects disappeared.  I talked to the P-doc and he said it takes something like 6 weeks to build up in your system. Well after about 6 weeks or so I started to notice the effects. It gave my Wellbutrin a huge boost and my energy level rose through the roof. People rating a medicine after 2 days is just ridiculous and annoying. Even the SSRI&#039;s take a couple weeks to work. Stop it people.""",5
Orsythia,Birth Control,"""I have the same problems as many of the other reviewers. My medication was changed from Avaine to Lutera to Orsythia. I had no problems with Avaine or Lutera but I&#039;ve been on Orsythia for about a week and I&#039;m experiencing horrible side effects. I&#039;ve had headaches, moodiness, and cramps. It feels exactly like I&#039;m PMSing and according to other reviewers, I just might be. I&#039;m glad I came here so I can be prepared for a possible mid cycle period.""",8
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I started getting anxiety about a year ago out of the blue. I had to go to the ER because I thought I was dying or something.  All my tests came back negative. The doctor told me it was an anxiety attack. I got sent home with nothing. A few days later I had another one. I went to my PHP and put me on clonazepam. I try not to take them if I don&#039;t need it,  but you never know when it may manifest.  So I try to take half doses to make my script stretch and to also not be as dependent.  I noticed that it works but to a less degree.  I commute to school and work a full time job so my mind is always running. In a nutshell, this medication works.""",7
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I lost 10 pounds effortlessly during the 2 week free trial. After 6 days, I had lost 6 pounds and at that point, started forcing myself to eat. I&#039;m wanting to achieve a steady, reasonable weight loss. No side effects other than slight dry mouth and sleeping more soundly. An interesting side note, Belviq is curbing all of my addictions...sugar, bread, alcohol, gambling. It&#039;s amazing so far. I&#039;m taking Belviq 2x daily with 1/2 phentermine tablet.""",2
Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I just started taking Tegretol on June 3 for mood stability. Also prescribed Celexa on same day. I also take Methadone 10mg 4x a day for chronic pain management for last 10 yrs. I love how it makes me feel and it&#039;s very hard for me to get angry BUT, it interferes with the methadone.  At first nothing except feeling drunk for the first 4-5 days. Then it started. Withdrawal symptoms, increased pain, restlessness, insomnia, fatigue and nausea. Not sure if I can continue treatment but will find out on June 24 after my doctors appointment. Also taking meloxicam. Will let everyone know my results Friday afternoon.""",6
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I just got the nexplanon implant on the 15th of February. I&#039;m not sure if my period is on. I&#039;m 8 weeks post partum. My bleeding stopped once I got the implant but then a couple days later it came back. I&#039;m not cramping or bloated like a period my bleeding went from medium light to heavy real quick. I&#039;ll definitely talk to my doctor about it. Only 2 weeks in with this implant and I feel good. No mood swings or nothing. I haven&#039;t even been feeling depressed and I&#039;m diagnosed with depression. Hopefully I don&#039;t have any troubles with this. Everyone  body&#039;s  reacts differently.""",8
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Ambien CR assists me in falling asleep but only briefly, often waking after just 3-4 hours. When it does work, I don&#039;t recall things like getting up to turn on lights and the TV full blast! I have also experienced dizziness, loss of motor skills and next day grogginess/sleepiness. Today I woke to find my small craft table smashed on the floor all the craft items scattered on the floor. A crash like that would most certainly have awoken me right? Well no it didn&#039;t and I don&#039;t recall knocking it over! So it had to be me while sleepwalking again! I have turned to taking it only when I am truly desperate for a decent night&#039;s sleep!  """,0
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on this med for a while now. The first month was really hard, I didn&#039;t see any changes. In fact I felt as bad or worse than before , But by the second month  I started to feel better. For me I&#039;ve noticed that if I take it during the day I have a headache feel fatigued and nauseas and sometimes hot too. So I make sure to take it at night before bed. There are two things I don&#039;t care for about this med though: the cost and the weight gain!""",5
Doryx,Acne,"""I&#039;ve always had struggles with acne, but around spring of 2010 is when it came to its worse. My self esteem was at its lowest, so that&#039;s when I made an appointment with my dermatologist. I was prescribed Doryx as my first antibiotic, while at the same time, taking birth control, and by November my complexion was completely cleared with no side effects ever having occurred. Now being off Doryx, and relying on my birth control to keep it clear, my skin is sadly going back to its old ways.""",4
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have serious insomnia issues worse than most people. Trazodone helps to initiate sleep but not to maintain it. However, if you have another medicine that helps with sleep maintenance or that increases slow wave sleep, trazodone can be a good ally. (for me, a combination of pregabalin and gabapentin helps with the latter). Between 50-150 mg should do the trick. If the dose is too high, instead of sleeping you may get stuck in a state that is between sleeping and awake, which is not so great. Hence it&#039;s good to titrate upwards and find that sweet spot.""",0
Ambien CR,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve tried several different sleep medications for insomnia and while attempting to get used to the CPAP machine for sleep apnea. Ambien CR works great, I can get a full nights sleep, however go to bed within 1 hour of taking the medication or you will feel a bit drugged. I don&#039;t recommend taking every night, it is addictive (try not to take more than 3 nights in a row). It is more difficult to wean off from than regular Ambien. Overall, if needed this is a good medication if taken responsibly.""",0
Levorphanol,Pain,"""A very effective pain medicine that you don&#039;t feel you have to go reaching for it all the time to get relief. I mean you can strictly adhere and take this responsibly per doctors directions. Not many pharmacies carry it, if at all so you will have to order it. That means bringing in your prescription to order it. It may take awhile but it is worth it, for severe pain. Just stick with a good oxycodone for other types of pain. This Levo-Dromoran lasts awhile and too much can cause respiratory depression.""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had Mirena for going on 4 yr in June and love it!  Insertion was quite uncomfortable... But not bad!  I never have suffered from bad cramps and continue the same (except 1 night having extreme discomfort.)  My boyfriend picked me up from the couch and took me to bed... I was in so much pain.... Constant most horrific cramping... Crying myself to sleep... He wanted to take me to hospital!  And I have had 2 kids 1 vag 1 c sec.  But I just wanted a dark rm and sleep... Woke up the next day normal!  Only bad experience the whole time!  Periods have ceased at moment... But usually monthly until 2 months ago pretty normal until stopped!  But I do recommend and give 10... Even with the 1 night!  Implanon was bad... Constant period!""",8
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I have been using this medication for 1 month and have lost 15 lbs.  I have been very fortunate and the only side effect I have experienced is a bit of a dry mouth.  That has not been bothersome it has only encouraged me to drink more water.  I have continued exercising 4-5 days/week. What has been a real blessing is I have not been obsessed with food and I cannot recall a time when food was a main focus of my thoughts.""",3
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Started taking this med at first prn for insomnia but then everyday due to stressful life events. At first it knocked me out stone cold and I slept good...but now just over a month of using it it does nothing for my insomnia. It just stopped working and I don&#039;t feel any better, I feel worse now because my insomnia has returned. Also, it does nothing for my mood but make me feel more aggressive. Food craving at first were insane, now that&#039;s gone. Overall, thumbs down.""",0
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""Klonopin has been instrumental in getting my anxiety disorder under control.  I take 0.25 milligrams three times a day...taking 0.5mg at once is too much and causes me to be a space cadet.  It doesn&#039;t work as well on my rare panic attacks, but I have found other ways to cope with breathing exercises and such. Without it I was nearly non-functioning and about to slip into a deep depression.  It has leveled my mood swings and just made life much more bearable (even joyful!). I would much rather have dependency on this medicine and be happy than feel that I am constantly in crisis (and occasionally suicidal).""",7
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I am a 27yr old female, 115lbs. I have been on Lexapro for 2 months now for anxiety. I have never had any problems with anxiety until I started working full-time (a lot of hours that are non-stop) and I started planning my wedding. All of this made me very irritable, stressed to the max, edgy, worried about every little thing, and just not myself. Since I&#039;ve been on Lexapro I&#039;ve been back to myself and better. I&#039;m relaxed and easy going through this stressful time! It took a few weeks for the medicine to kick in and for me to get over a few side effects (insomnia, constipation, tired in the afternoon) but it&#039;s totally worth it.""",7
Ultram,Pain,"""I am 29 years old.  I have fibromyalgia and hypermobility disorder.  Without this drug I would be worthless.  I used to be a grumpy person that could not accomplish anything without major difficulty.  I have taken Ultram ER 300 for the last 3 years. I have never been without this medicine for more than 12 hours.  I am now 3 days off this medicine because I ran out by accident.  This has been the most miserable experience of my life.  I am on the verge of getting written up at work.  I can not focus.  I feel horrible.  I cant go to sleep at night and I cant wake up in the morning.  This is truly miserable.  I feel as if I am being hit by a truck several times a day.""",9
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got my first nexplanon in 2013, had it for three years and got my new one about 2 weeks ago. I love it. I have two week periods every other month (so the same amount as a normal cycle within a year&#039;s time). Before it I had heavier periods. Now they are a lot lighter only downside is that I gained a few pounds (I became a lot less active also which added to the gained weight). When it was time to change it at the end of the three years my cycle stayed on for about 3weeks (Not bleeding the whole time. It was the normal two weeks as stated before and then a week of discharge that I usually get after my cycles). I&#039;ve read a lot of bad reviews on this, but I absolutely love it. I literally don&#039;t have to think about birth control for three year""",8
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I had this put in a little over a year ago. Wanted something long lasting as I knew I didn&#039;t want kids for a while (I was 17) and I can&#039;t take pills during Basic Training. No period for a year. A month ago my breasts started swelling up terribly, I gained about 7 lbs, and I become very moody. (Thought I was pregnant) This could be because I just graduated and am training for 5 months very soon, but I think the bar is mainly to blame. My period started yesterday-heavily. I haven&#039;t had it for 14 months. I think it&#039;s still worth it though (my insurance covers it). No real responsibility and time without the period was nice. """,8
Implanon,Birth Control,"""This is the worse birth control ever. I was on it for 2 years and 4 months.. everything was fine for the first year then after that I slowly started to get acne 1-2 spots every day for that year. Then the last 4 months of being on it I started to get so many white heads around my cheeks and jawline &amp; it started to make the acne  soo bad like 10 pimples every where every day. Not even make up would cover it  nothing helped. It made my face so bad. It also made me loose a lot of hair, thinned my hair out and made me eat heaps, I gained a lot of weight. As soon as I got off it I haven&#039;t gotten any pimples since, no hair loss and I don&#039;t eat like I did on it. I wouldn&#039;t recommended it for anyone, I&#039;m now stuck with scars waiting to fade.""",8
Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Birth Control,"""I am 20 years old and started taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen when I was 17. I have always been thin, and at the time of taking the pill I was 5&#039;8 130 pounds. My entire life I have been active and very in to healthy eating. A couple months in to Ortho Tri-Cyclen I noticed that I had been gaining weight, around 7-10 pounds even though my diet and excercise routine had not changed AT ALL. This caused me to workout even harder and clean up my diet even more, however the weight continued to pile on. I graduated high school and went off to college already 15 pounds heavier than I had been in highschool. I promised myself that I would lose the weight by Christmas break of my freshman fall semester. This did NOT happen. """,8
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""I have only been on this pill for 4 days now and I all ready have noticed large cystic pimples appearing on my cheeks and chin. I have never had perfect skin to begin with but I have never experienced cystic pimples nor have I ever broken out on my cheeks. After reading these reviews, I am glad to know that I am not the only one experiencing this. I started taking birth control to help with my heavy and irregular periods but I have ultimately decided to stop using this pill due to the negative effects it has already had on my skin. I personally do not recommend this pill especially if you are starting it with the intentions of clearing your skin.""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""This is extremely effective in preventing pregnancy. However the side effects are HORRIBLE. I have been on my period for most of this year. I got this in around the end of February beginning of March about two weeks later I started a full on period. It lasted for about THREE MONTHS, my doctor had to give me a prescription for it to stop. Then it stopped for about a month and started again and hasn&#039;t stopped since. That&#039;s another TWO MONTHS. I have been on my period for most of this year. This is not to mention the depression and 20 pound weight gain. """,8
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have ADHD since I was very young. I&#039;ve been on numerous different medications for it - Adderall XR, Concerta, Strattera, etc. Out of them all, Vyvanse has had the best results. Vyvanse helps me focus, get things done, act my age, and think before I act. I can focus on one thing at a time, rather than twenty things at once. One thing I have noticed about Vyvanse is that it treats my ADHD but doesn&#039;t take away from my personality. In other words, it doesn&#039;t make me feel like a zombie. I would definitely recommend Vyvanse to anyone with legitimate ADHD!""",1
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Temazepam for about 2 years now. It was originally prescribed for me for a two week term but I am continually prescribed it. It works very well to help me fall asleep and somewhat stay asleep. One out of three times I will find myself waking up in the middle of the night, tossing and turning, but that&#039;s not a big deal because I still get enough sleep. I have tried taking it and going to bed right after, but that does not work for me. I usually will wait an hour or so, and then I feel it hit me and I am sleeping within 5 minutes. You do need to be careful though on how long you wait after taking it (depending on the amount taken) because you WILL do things that you wont remember when you wake up. Overall great!""",0
Aviane,Birth Control,"""I began taking this birth control about 7 months ago. Upon taking it during the first month, I experienced severe nausea, headaches and a HEAVY period with the worst cramps I have ever had. Each month alternates with irregular bleeding (getting my period before the placebo pill week) with cramps which might be due to a wrong prescription. I have gained 7 pounds despite doing crossfit 4 times a week, retaining fat around my mid section. Also, I have been moody, anxious, and have had continuous night sweats and headaches. I will be getting off of this pill asap after realizing that this medication is not worth the horrible side effects. I keep giving it another month to see if it will get better but it hasn&#039;t.""",8
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""Took Lexapro for 5 years, gained 30 lbs (am very active), fell asleep at stop signs, very lethargic. Finally spoke with people who had had same effects, weaned off.  Terrible crash, lost 15 lbs.  Started Wellbutirn, had energy, which was wonderful, rages were awful.  I have started Pristiq with Wellbutrin wean; Pristiq 1 day, Wellbutrin the next for a week, then 2:1, 3:1, etc.  I am optimistic.  I feel better just addressing the problem and relieved to find some help.  Am raising 3 children and want better for them.  Worth mentioning, abrupt change of any medicines can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Beware and make sure that you read the signs.  Headache, nausea, mood swings, sweats, appetite loss etc. """,5
Voltaren,Pain,"""I have spondylolystesis and I have tried every type of medicine you could possibly think of. My doctor has put me on anti depressants, muscle relaxers, Norco, just about anything. I was constantly in pain. My back hurt all the time. I couldn&#039;t even do simple things like sweep the floor or do laundry. I went and seen my orthopedic surgeon and she put me on Voltaren 75mg and I feel like a new person. I have not had any back pain whatsoever. I highly recommend this medicine. I can actually do everything now with absolutely no back pain. Thank God.""",9
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""Wow!  This is a weightloss medicine that has really saved me!  At the end of December, I went to my doctor, fed up and disgusted with my weight.  I was a 48 year old female, 5&#039;1&quot; and weighed 226lbs.  I was just miserable.  I had to do something...well, my dr. prescribed Qsymia.  Since I tried to type out my story, and I was limited..here is the short story.  Qsymia made my Diet Coke addiction stop COLD TURKEY (it changes the taste of it completely - flat &amp; metallically).  As of the point I type this..I am now at 164 lbs.  That&#039;s 62lbs!  This pill works!  Take it!""",3
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I feel obligated to share my experience with Lexapro.  Before seeking psychiatric treatment, I&#039;d spend hours on this website (a well as others) reading reviews of Lexapro and similar SSRIs.  I suffer from GAD and Lexapro has helped tremendously.  The only downside was the side effects at first (unable to achieve orgasm, crazy dreams, extreme gas), but those have subsided.  My partner notices a complete turnaround in my stability.  I am very thankful for Lexapro.  I am so glad that I made it trough the first few weeks with the side effects.  This drug changed my life.""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I had mild to server acne at different times throughout years but then I finally decided to try Accutane. Initially, I did have an initial breakout which worsened the skin condition (more acne), which lasted for approximately 1.5months. But once the skin started getting better, everything started disappearing slowly and now I&#039;m 4.5 months in and only have the red/brown marks left but all my acne is gone! The first few months will be harsh, and your self-esteem will probably get hit. But just go through the whole cycle - you won&#039;t regret it in the end.""",4
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Effexor for several years and suffered severe sexual effects so went to the doc and he started me on Remeron. For the last three years I&#039;ve been training cardio 5-6 times  a week, had lost 10 kg and feeling quite proud of my body. Now at just over three months on Remeron I started feeling my clothes getting tighter, am feeling fat, bloated and lethargic. I can&#039;t train with the intensity I am  used to and just want to go to bed earlier and earlier. I weighed myself the other day and to my horror found I&#039;d put on 11 kg. I don&#039;t feel I&#039;ve been eating much more than I used to. Of course the realization that I&#039;ve lost everything I&#039;ve worked for in recent years has made me feel pretty bad, and  I&#039;m not sure I want to continue.""",5
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""I have had 2 Paraguard IUDs. Took the 1st one out to get pregnant, got the 2nd after my daughter was born. Both times, I had heavier periods, but it seemed better than hormonal birth control that makes me crazy. After 2 and a half years, I started having strange side effects. Lots of acne, dry skin, swollen lymph node, anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, hopelessness. My doctor said that my swollen lymph node is associated with the liver. My acupuncturist said she thought I had liver congestion. I researched excess copper in the body. ALL. MY. SYMPTOMS. Had it removed within 2 days. Felt immediately better. My acne started healing within a few days. Not feeling depressed anymore. It was great until it wasn&#039;t.""",8

Vyvanse,ADHD,"""this drug not only gave me a low key eating disorder but it made me have terrible, TERRIBLE mood swings all the time. it would make me cry and be irrationally angry at everyone at the same time. on top of that I would bearly be able to eat because the pill is also used as a way to treat binge eating. it also made me feel like I was having a heart attack at times and my heart would feel like it was going to stop beating. the only positive is that yes it did improve my focus and motivation immensly.""",1
Vistaril,Anxiety,"""Started Vistaril 25mg last night at 10pm.  I watched some T.V then went to sleep. No anxiety and no unpleasant side effects. Today I&#039;ve taken another 25mg.  Didn&#039;t feel any need to take my Ativan.  But due to being on 4mg a day for years, I did take one just to be on the safe side and not seize or anything. My experience so far has been a good one. And I hope to continue to slowly come down on my Ativan use.
My meds: Lexapro 5mg taperd down from 10mg. Ativan 1mg 4x daily. Fioricet when needed and now Vistaril 25mg every 6 hours when needed.""",7
Gabapentin,Pain,"""For 5 years I had severe constant pain from arthritis around my right collar bone pressing nerves. Along that journey, I had a nerve ablation done on my C3-C4-C5 vertebrae that helped a pinched nerve there.   Finally found a pain specialist who put me on Gabapentin   Nortriptyline (usually for depression). Gabapentin alone did nothing.  He convinced me the 25mg Nortriptyline is a tiny dose but works great with the Gabapentin.  He was right.  Immediate relieve.  After surprise surgery for a perforated sm intestine, had to hold off all Rx&#039;s while in the hospital. Then started lightening bolts of Siatica nerve pain down right leg. EGAD.  Back home, restarted Gaba and Nortrip - Siatica all better.  Wow!""",9
Armodafinil,ADHD,"""My initial QbTest score was 99. I was prescribed Vyvanse 20mg but was supposed to be taking 3/day. I misunderstood and only took 1 early in the morning on the day of my follow up test. I have Nuvigil that I take occasionally for shift work sleep disorder. I took one to help stay alert on my afternoon drive to the follow up test. My QbTest score dropped from 99 to 12. I am sure that the Nuvigil is responsible because the Vyvanse was taken at the lowest dose and several hours outside the time window.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I recently started Contrave. I lost 10 pounds in a week and a half. It&#039;s been interesting. It&#039;s like I am hungry but I don&#039;t want to eat, and I&#039;m okay with it. I changed my routine up a bit and now it&#039;s going really well. I eat a really big healthy breakfast, skip lunch (I&#039;m really busy then) and then I eat a light dinner. I make sure to drink plenty of water! 

I started with one pill a day and then moved to two. I had a pretty intense panic attack so I had to stop taking it. I have started back again but only with one pill a day. Two is obviously more effective, but Not at the risk of having panic attacks.""",2
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""Taken all types of anti depressants. None worked until a friend mentioned Wellbutrin. Started off on 150mg SR generic brand. Anxiety increased, smoking decreased, sex drive moderate, no change in weight or additional side effects. After two yes doctor finally prescribed 24 hr Wellburtin. Taking name brand. Day 2 &amp; WOWWWWW. Im feeling fabulous. I have Valium in case for emergency anxiety attacks. But I honestly believe this is a winner""",5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien for more years than I can count due to insomnia and nightmares.  I have experienced the &quot;sleep walking&quot; activities, mostly repetitive conversations and eating which have been benign and harmless.  Fortunately, I have family that is up later than me so they keep me from doing anything too outrageous.  Sometimes I have a vague memory of my activities if my husband brings it to my attention, but if I am particularly stressed or anxious the side effects are amplified and my memory is gone.  As for morning grogginess, a shower usually perks me up.""",0
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""It didn&#039;t work for me, I was on 40mg initially to start, and it wasn&#039;t helping, I could feel myself slipping into a worse depression, so the doctor upped it 60 mg. I then started breaking out in hives which itched so bad I would scratch them open (now have scars). Although even at 60, it still wasn&#039;t working for me. Off to find another substitute for seroquel (that&#039;s not working anymore either). I hope it helps other though, it just didn&#039;t work for me.""",6
Armodafinil,ADHD,"""NUVIGIL is so far my best medication for ADD. I have both Asperger&#039;s Disorder and Attention Deficit Disorder, but NUVIGIL is mostly for my ADD. NUvigil has 1/10 the potency of amphetamine, suppresses hunger more than how much hunger INVEGA would produce, and helps me concentrate. The pill works very well, without the jitters. It also worked as relief for my depression, while taking an antidepressant.""",1
Intuniv,ADHD,"""The first few days on 1 mg in the morning, he was so tired in the afternoon, but by the 5th day he was doing better.  At 2 mg, it started over but never faded.  

After 3 weeks, the Dr. suggested taking it at night, but it was no better.  He would fall asleep on his desk after lunch, in the car or on the cough after school, and just completely lost his personality.  He was calm, and could focus better, but he never laughed, was never silly, barely played, it was awful.  

We tried going back to 1 mg but had more trouble focusing again, so we tried 1mg in the morning and 1 in the evening.  But he was still a little zombie.  SO we gave up.  I&#039;d rather have him bouncing off the walls than too tired to laugh and play.""",1
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m 24 and I started getting acne when I was 23.. Only on my chin area. 
I would get 1-3 cystic pimples at a time then, a few &quot;normal&quot; ones around them with constant clogged pores.
I tried everything for a year, diet change, different contraceptive pill, naturopathy, medicated face cleansers, antibiotic ointment, anti fungal antibiotics. Nothing worked, until I was prescribed Doxycycline, and a topical cream of Epiduo. 
Doxycycline has worked, I have been on it for 70 days now and my skin is smooth and clear, although it was a tough journey. 
I had sensitive skin, drying skin, and lots of sore pimples coming out (more than usual)
Push through that because it does take time. 
Epiduo was good to help the inflammation.. Don&#039;t apply much!""",4
Mirena,Birth Control,"""previously on pills and they were driving me mad and not working (severe headaches and cramps) so I decided to try the coil, afterall if it doesnt work I can get it removed. The first week was fine, I did end up with severe cramps but my doctor booked me in for a scan and checked it was fine which it was and we just put the cramps down to my body adjusting to the coil.

I had very light periods for around two/three months and then my periods completely stopped and have done ever since. i still have very mild cramps but nothing like what i had on the pill, I&#039;m really happy with the mirena and would recommend but you need to be aware its not for everyone but worth a try!!!""",8
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on fluoxetine 10 mg for only 5 days. I have noticed some changes already. I have the worst anxiety and for the past 3 days, stressful situations seem a tad bit less stressful for me. I already lost 4-5 pounds on it. It makes me never think about food anymore. It makes me not hungry for hours. Even a small granola bar can keep me satisfied and full for 5-6 hours... But I force myself to have breakfast lunch and dinner. Things seem more brighter, colors are more vivid to me. Overall I think it&#039;s starting to work. I will re-respond in a few weeks to touch base.""",5
Methadone,Pain,"""Been a methadone nurse for 10+ years and have seen the good and bad. The good is it has helped a number of people with pain. And those who use it for pain tend to use it like their other prescribed meds. The bad comes mostly from those who use it for substance abuse treatment. Methadone is NOT a treatment of substance abuse, but a tool to aid in the treatment of substance abuse. It does not cure withdrawal, it stops withdrawal symptoms when at a therapeutic level. You will experience withdrawal symptoms when methadone is tapered or discontinued. Those using methadone for substance abuse tend to treat methadone in similar ways as a street drug. I have seen people lick the inside and outside of cup when dosing. And camp out in front of clinic""",9
Remeron,Insomnia,"""Remeron is great for insomnia, start with very small doses and work up. I use the dissolving tablets, easier to break up. Immediately stopped my anxiety. Drawbacks are increased appetite and after prolonged periods of consumption it can affect your blood pressure regulation, mostly noticeable when you stand up fast. Excellent for stopping the racing thoughts. It can be difficult waking up in the beginning but this gets better with time. It also suppressed my sex drive. All in all excellent for those who have tried everything, gotten hooked, suffered withdrawals from the &quot;pines&quot; and need something for sleep.""",0
Concerta,ADHD,"""I can&#039;t say it&#039;s bad. I can Ace through an assignment on my dosage like an Ariel Atom. BUT there are some things I did experience, as I was taking it and in High School I noticed I didn&#039;t care to hang out with anyone. There was times when I did but I was terrified. The days I&#039;d forget my dose I was buzzing with charisma. I&#039;d have to say out of all these the creativity it sucks out of you scares me because I&#039;m a musician. But the worst is the withdrawal effects, they hit you fast in the morning even before you take your dose( Headaches, can&#039;t wake up) and irritability. It gets the job done but there are too many side-effects.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 24 year old recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I&#039;ve been misdiagnosed by many doctors, been on several medications such as lithium and prozac (which I reacted horribly too and sometimes ended up in a psych hospitals) as a result of those misdiagnosis and I was untreated for ADHD my entire life since I was first diagnosed at the age of 9. I&#039;ve been on Vyvanse for over a year now under the direction of a new doctor/addiction specialist and this medication has CHANGED MY LIFE. It has made me more focused and productive, more motivated, less hyper, less anxious; it has also CURED my insomnia. This is the real me: balanced, organized, articulate, focused and productive. So happy a doctor finally got my diagnosis right.""",1
Pristiq,Depression,"""I was on 50mg first...I was crazy then I went on 100mg. Changed my life.  I was actually living! ! When I missed a few days, I thought it was making me sick,  but never missed any doses. Then my doctor cancelled on me 3 days in a row . At that point it was 6 days,  so I said screw it, I&#039;ll stay off them  and I did fine. Wasn&#039;t sickly...didn&#039;t go crazy. I was fine.  
This past 3.5 years of being off it, I&#039;ve gone way down hill.  So I&#039;m excited about going back on them and getting a life back.  I tell you,  before I went on them I was in a really bad place.  PTSD,  from my child hood, my brother killed him self, had none in my life.  Got on pills started jogging and working out, eating good, because I felt good for once. Lost 50lbs. Getting back""",5
Lidocaine,Pain,"""I have used the lidocaine patches by Watson for years for osteoporosis in my neck and back and they decreased my pain from a 10 to a 3.  No narcotics needed.  Now I have been given the lidocaine patch made by Milan and they are absolutely HORRIBLE. .WASTE OF MONEY.. USELESS. Not only are they nearly impossible to separate from the plastic backing once you finally get them on they start peeling up immediately. . These are a total waste of money and someone should do something about this because the Mylan company surely doesn&#039;t care. .. now I will need to take a pill to help with the pain...""",9
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Latuda for about three weeks now for bipolar II.  I don&#039;t suffer too badly from it, mostly slight depression and irritability. Started week one on 40 mg and was still slightly depressed but not cranky. Upped it to 80 mg and am feeling sunshiny again. Positive attitude is back, interest in things, no longer cranky, more focused, more outgoing. The only MAJOR problem is I am sleepy all the time! I tried taking it at dinner, bedtime, and lunch. I pass out out at 8:30 at night, can&#039;t get up in the morning and fight to stay awake at my desk at work. I have read lots of other posts that people have said it passes after a month or so, I really hope so because otherwise its a great med. No other side effects for me.""",6
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m coming to the end of one year on this medication. It has worked very well for me, causing almost a 50 pound weight loss. I went from the initial low 3+ mg dose to a 11.25 mg. Some things I noticed while taking this medication:

*High irritability/moodiness/depression for the first 2-3 days after increasing doses (I&#039;m also on Citalopram)
*I&#039;ve lost this weight without having to change my diet or add exercise. It has simply decreased my appetite.
*Now that I&#039;m stepping down the dosage, I&#039;m experiencing high levels of hunger and am gaining roughly five pounds per week (consistent for the past 2-3 weeks)""",3
Nucynta,Pain,"""Nucynta has worked very well for all my aches and pain, from the most severe to those I didn&#039;t even know I had.  At first, it did make me groggy which was a problem, but I kept taking it anyway because it did take away most of my pain.  After a couple of months of use, it takes away my pain, just like it did at the beginning, but I no longer feel sleepy.  I feel energetic, happier and am able very active because I hardly feel any pain.  I highly recommend it, but you do have to give it a chance because once your body adapts to it, the adverse effects far outweigh the benefits.""",9
Acanya,Acne,"""I LOVE this product. I suffered from breakouts (not horrible) but enough to make me self-conscious about. It does not make your face dry, if anything it smooths it out. I use a tad in the morning and a whole pump at night all over my face. I haven&#039;t been getting pimples at all, except for a few that were unnoticeable. And it worked almost immediately. I also paired this with Solodyn tablets 55mg for only the first month. Amazing. If anyone has mild breakouts then I strongly recommend these 2 products. Good luck. This may not work for everyone, but if you have mild acne then I would go for it.""",4
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been dealing with mental health issues since I was about 19yr.s old and am 45 now. I have been on numerous medication, too many to count and I started taking latuda about 3 weeks ago. I also take trileptal, lamictal, litium, and prozac, and vyvance, and I can&#039;t begin to tell u how much better I feel. It just amazes me. I haven&#039;t snapped at anyone in a couple of weeks, my mood is the most stable its been in 20yrs. I actually like to be around people again. I&#039;m not full of hate and anger. I have dealt with some serious nausea, vomiting, and headaches so it is very important to eat at least the recommended amount of calories, and its much better if I take it at night. I am very grateful I was willing to try latuda. Thank u.""",6
Minocycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m rating this a 6/10 because it was INCREDIBLE for my acne. After a week my skin had never looked so clear in 10 years. It was seriously amazing. But unfortunately it made me unbearably dizzy. I had to stop after two weeks and I was so upset about it but I just could barely function. I&#039;ve been taking Doxycycline now for a month and it works half as well but doesn&#039;t give me any side effects. I&#039;m bummed out about it but it&#039;s worth trying in case you don&#039;t have the side effects I did.""",4
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I have tried all the fad diets to no avail.  I&#039;ve tried over the counter weight loss pills and nothing has worked since stacker 3 original formula was banned.  I was told I would only get Adipex for 3 months.  My third check up is tomorrow and I&#039;ve lost 50lbs so far.  The pill is starting to feel like it&#039;s losing it&#039;s effectiveness.  Tomorrow I am going to start a 10 day break in hopes that when I start back up it will be as effective as the first month.  I&#039;ve got another 40 to go, so hopefully it works.  It&#039;s been great, though.  50 lbs in 2 months when nothing else helped before is very impressive.  It&#039;s nice hearing all the compliments on the weight loss too.""",2
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Having had the mirena in for nearly two years at doctors advice, I&#039;m having it removed on Thursday as its the worst thing to have done.
It has made me depressed, mood swing are horrendous to the point my children and husband are getting it all. I have no desire what so ever to be intimate with my husband.  I feel like I have lost control of my body.
The only plus is I don&#039;t have periods , PLEASE do your research and choose wisely which contraceptive method you have.""",8
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I&#039;ve taken Oxyfast for 18 months now for treatment following a severe auto accident (I suffered multiple herniation&#039;s in my neck and back, torticollis, jaw dislocation, head trauma, right rotator cuff and right hand ligaments permanently scarred.  It took 4 years for me to succumb to taking this medication because of all the bad publicity. I was introduced to it by people who eventually suffered severe addictions.  I&#039;m happy to say even though I&#039;m prescribed over 200 mg per day I only take it for breakthrough pain to relieve the torture in my head (supposedly cluster headaches). I can stop for weeks at a time and am very thankful it doesn&#039;t affect me negatively (i.e. withdrawals).""",9
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This is an update of my use of Seroquel. I have been on 800 mg./day for over a year now. My doctor had to keep increasing the dose due to stubborn anxiety/depression. My moods have calmed down a lot, not so many highs and lows. I do still see a therapist which helps with coping with life stresses and behavioral difficulties. I sleep a lot, between 8-10 hours nightly. I still take a small amount of Ambien just to help shut down the racing thoughts in my mind. I am having a hard time with my weight. I want to eat the wrong things all the time. I&#039;m 15lbs. heavier now then I was before taking Seroquel, but the Wellbutrin I was on made me not want to eat ever again so I was way under weight, 125lbs. at 5&quot;8&#039; tall.""",6
Duac,Acne,"""I have been using this cream for over a year now and my spots have cleared, do still get the occasional one now and then but that&#039;s normal. Duac cream has reduced the darkness of my blackhead as well. I have also been noticing my skin has been quite red, so I&#039;ve laid of the cream for a while and just been using a scrub before bed to see. Overall I would recommend this to anyone, but there are side effects if you are allergic to some of the products in it. Ask your doctor for more information. Hope this helped.""",4
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking Ambien since January 2006 and about 4 weeks ago I began to have issues sleeping only been getting 2-3 hrs a night. I called my psychologist and family doctor about the situation. I was given Lunesta through my family doctor. Tried that for a couple days and couldn&#039;t still couldn&#039;t sleep. Then I thought it was my Wellbutrin so I went &quot;cold turkey&quot; on that for about a week until I almost had a break down. Then I started taking half of my Wellbutrin and feel a little better. My psychologist just gave me a prescription for the Ambien Cr and only have taken for 2 nights so far. I just want some sleep.. my grades are suffering and so is my job.""",0
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the implant in March 2014 , it didn&#039;t take long to insert but it ached for 5 weeks. For the first 7 months my bleeding was light but now I rarely get a day of no bleeding. I have had side effects since insertion. I&#039;ve had nausea, painful cramps, tender breast,  Weight gain and fatigue. It hasn&#039;t been all peachy but I&#039;m not pregnant. I plan to get it removed it&#039;s more trouble than helpful for me.""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had this for almost 2 years. I rated it high because I am not pregnant. But I do feel that the bad side effects outweigh the good.
I didn&#039;t have a period for like 3 months and then I got one and it wasn&#039;t terrible. Then I consistently got them every 3 months. 
However, the past 2 months I&#039;ve gotten a heavy period every 2 weeks and they are painful. 
Not to mention, I have definitely gained weight. If I had to guess I&#039;d say 20 lbs. and I&#039;ve stayed the same weight for awhile now. I&#039;m 22. 5&#039;10 and a college athlete. So I eat decently well and workout multiple times a day and I cannot lose a pound. My depression has also been bad. I made an appointment with my doctor to discuss other birth control options""",8
Methadone,Pain,"""I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 2009 after breaking my neck and lower back in a car accident. I was taking approximately 14 pills a day...everything from Percocet to Morphine as well as anti-depressants.  My marriage failed and I was not able to cope with every day routines. My pain was so great. Finally, after seeing a pain management doctor and taking myself off all of the medications, I was prescribed Methadone and what a miracle it has been. I still have to take Norco with the Methadone, but my pain level is becoming more manageable. I am not able to work but I can get out of bed now and maintain somewhat of a life with less pain. What a great improvement this has been for me. I hope this helps someone who is unsure.""",9
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I have always been fit, and losing those few pounds that manage to creep up on us from time to time was always fairly easy.  Once I hit my 50&#039;s however, things changed.  I went to the gym, I ate well, but nothing.  In fact I GAINED weight when I thought I should be losing or at least stable.  Thank goodness my dr suggested CONTRAVE.  It dramatically reduced my appetite, so that when I ate, I made good food choices and stuck to a reasonable portion.  And those evening snacks were a thing of the past.  The daily weighing is awesome because you can see even the smallest change.  I was not obese, but 5&#039;5 at 166 lbs was the most I&#039;d ever weighed and I was  completely uncomfortable in my own skin (and clothes!)  I am now almost 30 lbs down.""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""After years of just dealing with what my ever-fleeting groups of friends called &quot;moody-behavior&quot; (I never seemed to keep friends more than a year). I decided to get therapy, but cognitive behavioral therapy, my therapist kept hinting for me to see a psych and get medicines, at least for the depression. After months of pressure I relented and decided to just see my GP and ask for anti-depressants. Needless to say they didn&#039;t work and made me feel distant yet anxious, constantly anxious and at the ready. I waited to see if my body would adjust, it didn&#039;t. I quit. I reached out to a recommended psych and was given a script for Lamotrigine, as I went up in dosage (to 200mg) I started to notice that life made sense. It was/is a NEW DAY.""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 24 year old male. I was on Adderall XR 30mg (daily) for around 3-4 years before my Doctor suggested we try Vyvanse. I have always been pleased with Adderall XR and have no complaints about side effects. Vvyanse (60mg daily) worked as advertised for a about 3-4 days. It was like an upgraded Adderall XR (provided a longer half life that is much needed for my schedule of college and work). Unfortunately, the drug drastically lost its effectiveness. The dry mouth was extreme as well. After just 10 days taking 2 at a time had no effect. Went back to adderall xr and I&#039;m still impressed.""",1
Yasmin,Birth Control,"""I was on Yasmin for about 5 years had no serious problems with it and it worked great as a form of birth control. I gained weight but not sure if the pill is to blame. I had irritable mood swings but nothing too bad. The one biggest side effect for me that made me switch was the migraines I was getting while taking the placebos. Each and every month I would have migraines while on my period. But other than that I love this pill, my periods were always on time I had short 3-4 day periods with minimal cramping. I have just started taking Levora, which my doctor recommended taking 3 straight months and then having my period to minimize the migraines. So far I&#039;ve had breakthrough bleeding and heavy as well for about a week. I hope it gets better.""",8
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Started B first in May at 208lb. Went though a bad break up and lost 8 pounds. Was not hungry at all could have been the B or being dumped. IDK.

Xulane,Birth Control,"""I have been on xulane for 3 months now and I love it. Before I started my periods were bad with headaches, cramping, and heavy flow, after the first month my periods dwindled and now I only need light pads, I rarely cramp and have maybe one headache. However I do get some redness and irritation on my skin, trouble with the patch adhering to my skin and also my eating habits have changed dramatically, sometimes I&#039;ll be starving and when I see what I&#039;m about to eat I lose any urge to eat. I would recommend it but be sure you remain aware of your body.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""On for 9 weeks.  Started dose gradually as prescribed, 2 days I had constant diarrhea.  Immediately, my cravings were gone for SUGAR &amp; CHOCOLATE, but keep reading! At full dose (2am, 2pm), I had constipation, got better after taking Colace.  I felt fine all day &amp; night, but when the evening dose had worn off by the am I would wake up SHAKING &amp; HEART RACING. Felt better after next dose, but shaky all day. One day I almost passed out after normal exercise. Then Non-Stop Nausea set in so now I could not eat and felt like vomiting just from looking at food!  Drug made me ANXIOUS &amp; Jittery so I stopped it. Lost weight..20 pounds in 9 wks, mostly because of NAUSEA, but side effects were not worth the weight loss.""",2
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Like many others I suffer from general anxiety on and off for 10 year and this past winter it got the best of me to the point that I couldn&#039;t function. I used xanax 0.5 up to 3 times per day for that episode but that is not the long term solution that I wanted. So I was put on escitalopram 10mg and holy crap it gave me my life back. The first 3 weeks were tough with the nausea, sweating, insomnia, mood swings. BUT if you can stick it out the 3-5th week I noticed a gradual and significant improvement in mood and ability to control thought.Since Week 5 I have been what I consider totally normal for the past 7 months.  I encourage anyone going through this to hang in there it will get better. Listen to your doctors.""",7
Escitalopram,Depression,"""This is my 4th day on Lexapro and I already feel ten times better then I did this past weekend. I suffer from anger, depression and anxiety and due to this it cost me a 9 year relationship with my partner. I could not bare the fact we broke up because of my personal issues which put me more deeper in depression/anxiety. I could not eat, sleep or go to work without crying or feel like I just wanted to disappear. I don&#039;t know what I would do if I was not on Lexapro. I&#039;m finally starting to feel like myself again and see positive aspects of life instead of all the negatives. I love Lexapro and hope after 2 weeks when it&#039;s completely in my system things only get better. I would recommend Lexapro to anyone suffering from these conditions.""",5
Roxicodone,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been on Roxicodone for about two years now and this is the ONLY short acting medication that has worked.  I have been through all the short acting or break through medicines and Roxicodone is by far the greatest.  I am on high doses due to having gastric bypass and not absorbing as a &#039;normal&#039; person would.  I need to have my tailbone removed as it&#039;s broken and swinging around back there.

Dr. prescribed Zyprexa 5mg and after 3 days, I started eating again.  I have already gained 2 lbs but I needed to because I was so nauseated I couldn&#039;t eat.

Although I did jump to 1.2ml in week 2 and started 1.8ml in week 3 but had to drop back to 1.2ml as it was way too strong and nausea killed me. Will stick to 1.2ml for the time being seeing good results with 4 1/2 pens still to go. 
Looking promising :)""",3
Dapsone,Acne,"""Never written a review but this product is sensational. Best creme on the market, doesn&#039;t irritate skin and very effective for preventing and healing acne. Works well on face but even better on chest/back I found. Just a few heads up. Don&#039;t use with any hydrogen peroxide based products(moisturizer creme etc) at this will temporarily turn your skin brown. Also don&#039;t apply too much at a time as it takes a long time to absorb(it will be visible for a short period). 

After using accutane I thought that was the only thing that could really help acne but this works almost as well""",4
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I started taking contrave 4 weeks ago. I have lost 6 lbs. I have had no side effects from this drug. It definitely works to curb hunger and craving. I eat to live and not live  to eat.  I tried Belvique and Qysemia and they both were a waste of money and time. This drug is the only one that&#039;s curbs hunger and cravings without any side effects. I will continue to take it till I reach my goal. I&#039;d recommend this drug highly""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on various antidepressants and benzo&#039;s for 25 years due to depression (bipolar II) and anxiety.  Lamictal has changed my life.  The depression lifted and the anxiety went away.  I dropped the Xanax and Prozac and feel unbelievably well on 300mg of just lamictal.  I&#039;ve felt this way for two years so far.  I wish I had found it years ago.  I do think that the Prozac and Xanax were causing anxiety/depression/exhaustion.  I&#039;m doing fantastic on the lamictal alone.""",6
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I took my first pill last night, and feel better already!
I had never before suffered from anxiety, until I started a new and very stress-filled job. I held my own at first, but the past few months really took it&#039;s toll on my physical health. Yesterday, I truly believed I was having either a heart attack, or panic attack...I&#039;ve never had a panic attack, never! Rushed to my doctor who looked at me and said- I&#039;ve never seen you look like this before.
After explaining how my job was affecting my life, and talking about different stress/anxiety relievers, and making time for me, he wrote the prescription. I was hesitant to take, but slept like a baby for the first time in months! 
I will check back as I continue with the medication.""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I have been on Methylin ER for about a year and a half. I still have a lot of difficulty with ADHD symptoms, but the medication helps.  I can tell when I don&#039;t take it properly, my symptoms increase.  I have only had to increase the dosage once in about six months. I think that I need another increase now. I have not had any problems with side effects. My appetite is fine, no sleep issues (if anything, I sleep better now), no anxiety or increased blood pressure.""",1
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""Ahhh LUNESTA! I absolutely love this stuff. I started taking it when I was put on an anti depressant that gave me severe insomnia as a side effect. That went away as my body got used to the AD, but I do get insomnia here and there and Lunesta is my drug of choice. I used to use either Benadryl or Melatonin for my occasional insomnia, however, I find Lunesta is the best at putting you in a nice peaceful sleep, and not make you too groggy in the morning. Most people criticize Lunesta for it&#039;s &quot;metallic&quot; taste, but I have a ridiculously simple solution: Don&#039;t let the pill touch your tongue! I fill my mouth with water first, push the pill through my closed lips, and then swallow. Never had the bad taste since doing that! Try it out!!""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""OK ladies (and gentleman) 
I cannot believe this I LOST 13LBS  IN 5 days. I started When 6-29-15 weighing 269.. I went to the doctor 7-3-15 and weighed 256 (no way).. Im still in shock.. My husband is so scared because he never seen anything like it. I completely changed the way I eat.. I only eat grilled or baked foods, fruits and lots of water with lemon (my skin is now amazing). I eliminated everything that&#039;s not clean. I removed fast food, soda, salts, sweets basically everything that was killing me slowly. The appetite suppression is amazing and allows me to make better and healthier decisions.. I have had side effects but they are starting to subside. I do not own the a scale but my clothes are getting very lose.""",3
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My 6 year old daughter was put on Daytrana about 8 months after trying Vyvanse and Strattera without success. We had immediate results. She was focused and even her handwriting improved. The patch did leave a red mark that I found Eucerin cream was good for. Here is the but: She developed a tic.  Don&#039;t let this discourage you. I know of others on Daytrana who have been taking it for over a year with no tics. It really worked great.""",1
Dyanavel XR,ADHD,"""My 7 year old daughter is severe ADHD.  Prior to Dyanavel XR, our best experience was with 30 mg of adderall XR.  But that had a profound effect on her appetite and ability to interact with other people.  We tried concerta which left her very defiant, Focalin and Vyvance were completely ineffective.  We tried Dyanavel for the first time one months ago.  I can&#039;t believe the difference.  She has an appetite, she socializes, she has a personality, she stays in her seat at school and actually works in her assignments.  After 4 days on this medication, her teacher called me and asked what had changed because she couldn&#039;t believe the difference. The only downfall is nighttime.  She consistently wakes up around 4-5 am with dreams.""",1
Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo,Birth Control,"""PROS: For me, this pill caused no weight gain. It really did help with cramps, too.
CONS: This pill caused me to break out horribly (my acne was solely concentrated to my forehead before, and even then, it was very mild). I had better skin when I was 15 (I&#039;m 20 now). I&#039;m having a variety of weird symptoms I have literally never had before going on this pill, such as constant dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue, acid reflux, and rapid heartbeat (which I absolutely believe was caused by this birth control. Why else would a healthy 20 year old have these problems literally within the exact time frame of taking this pill?). Overall, not for me. I will keep searching for my ideal pill.""",8
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I was on phentermine several years ago but didn&#039;t really try to change my eating habits and so it didn&#039;t work. I decided to try it again because I just keep piling on the weight and am slowly killing myself. I&#039;ve been on it 3 days now and have already lost 8.4 pounds! I know it&#039;s mostly water weight right now but seeing that scale move so quickly is such a big motivator. My starting weight was 443.8 and now I&#039;m 435.4. I eat between 1200-2000 calories per day. I&#039;ve noticed that I&#039;m eating less each day though and it helps take away the cravings so I can make smart decisions about what to eat. I am also watching my carbs and sugar intake. Only side effect I&#039;ve had is mild dry mouth and not feeling sleepy during the day like I normally do.""",2
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got my Skyla in August of this year. I previously had the Nexplenon and loved it. I&#039;m 24, never had children and had not had period from 6/2014 to 8/2016. I was not informed to take any kind of muscle relaxer or anti-inflammatory beforehand. The insertion was terrifying and painful. The &quot;test&quot; probe hurt so bad that I pushed out the speculum. Which meant that they had to start all over. The cramping was painful and I was so glad I did it on a Friday. Since insertion, I have had a period every month and the cramps are excruciating. I also get sharp pains when I am not on period. I called the doctor today and told them what was going on. They told me that I need to go back to the Nexplenon asap.""",8
Seroquel,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking this medication for quite awhile, and while it worked at first, I noticed that I quickly started building up a tolerance to it. Every couple of weeks, my dose is increased, and it&#039;s been very frustrating. While it does get me to sleep, it doesn&#039;t help me stay asleep. Also, there has been a tremendous amount of weight gain, which I can&#039;t lose even with diet and exercise. Great for short term, not for long term.""",0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had Skyla inserted 6 months ago. I would describe insertion as the most uncomfortable I&#039;ve ever been. It was extreme pressure in a place deep inside my body &ndash; nothing I&#039;ve felt before, but also not exactly pain. It lasted maybe 20 seconds before subsiding into the feeling of menstrual cramps. Those cramps lasted 3-4 days after insertion, and I spotted for the first month. Since then, Skyla has been pretty good. The only time I notice Skyla is during my period. My bleeding is light, but WOW do I get horrible cramps. I rarely got cramps prior to using Skyla, and these feel similar to the ones I had post-insertion. However my friends have not had this issue &ndash; every body is different. Overall I do recommend Skyla!""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hey guys checking in again. So when I started I was 198 and now I weigh 145 !!!!
This pill is simply amazing!! I&rsquo;m closer to my goal weight which is 130!
If you&rsquo;ve been reading my previous reviews you&rsquo;ll know everything!!! I still have the blurry vision but that&rsquo;s it. And it comes and goes now. Also. I skip the pill some days, so that I can see if I can eat good without it. And I do well. Bcuz I&rsquo;m a min I won&rsquo;t qualify to take it anymore. So if you&rsquo;re having doubts. I say DONT doubt!! Take it and watch the weight FALL!!!!

Hydrocodone,Pain,"""This is an update to my posting late Jan. Now after 4 months of titration I&#039;m at 40mg. But disappointed. I could sleep 12 hours each night if allowed to, constantly tired. And taking a new hysingla pill every 15-18 hours for bleed-through pain. Definitely missing my old four times a day Percs, but I&#039;d be doubling up on those too I&#039;m sure. So Dr says live with it. Pain level at 2. But never any better. And that&#039;s disappointing. Dr won&#039;t go higher.""",9
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I have been on this medication a month and I have lost 11 lbs. With the appropriate diet and exercise this medication is wonderful. At first it did give me the gitters and a mild headache but after a few days its just fine. It controls my appetite and I have to remind myself to eat alot of the time. I also take Topamax at night time as part of my weight lost plan. I highly recommend this medication.""",2
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I&#039;m a 23 yr old with severe anxiety and insomnia and my insomnia has been getting worse over the past few months. I can&#039;t remember the last time I slept through the night or fell asleep in less than three hours. Melatonin did nothing for me and Benadryl didn&#039;t do much either. I tried unisom last night. I fell asleep much faster than usual- probably took me about 30 minutes. But after 2 1/2 hrs I was awake again. I couldn&#039;t fall back to sleep. I tried looking up if I could take another 25mg (I had taken 50mg before I went to sleep) but I couldn&#039;t find anything about whether 75mgs total is too much? I&#039;m frustrated because it put me to sleep so quickly, and I slept heavily, but it lasted so short a time that it barely made a difference.""",0
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed Ambien for insomnia because I am going through a particularly stressful time in my life. It does put me to sleep quickly but I&#039;ve had several bouts of sleep walking. The last one was two nights ago and this one might actually cause me to stop taking it. My room mate said I got up and started to cut up some chicken then mixed it with some dry dog food. This wouldn&#039;t be bad if I then fed it to my dog but instead, I started feeding it to myself! Thankfully after I took one bite, she said I spit it out so I guess I wasn&#039;t completely out of it. I discovered other things like food taken out of the fridge and sugar spilled on the counter. Other than these things, the drug works great!""",0
Lidocaine,Pain,"""I&#039;ve used other forms of this patch which works like a miracle pain remedy and would find pain relief instead of taking opioids which weren&#039;t working anyway. However, to my misfortune they do not make any other patch that I&#039;m aware of anymore aside for these Mylan Lidoderm patches and THESE DO NOT STICK TO THE SKIN! I&#039;ve tried everything to make the patches stick from putting tape (which I&#039;m shouldn&#039;t have to do), to rubbing it on.  These patches need to be re-made to stick!! PLEASE...PLEASE...the OTHER ONES  .. HELPED WITH MY PAIN from a 10 to a 3 with the one&#039;s that stick!! For me that&#039;s great, I&#039;m happy!!""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I absolutely love the Mirena.  Afer getting with my lifepartner 8 years ago I opted for the Mirena because he had custody of his two daughters and I had custody of my 2 sons.  It has worked great, no periods (unless months up to it being switched), comfortable, and keeps my hormones where they need to be, constant due to my bipolar.  I am up for my 3rd round in August and wish I could just do it now.  I still use it even though my life partner is cut... just in case!  We have enough.  LOL  Give it a try.  I love it!""",8
Benzaclin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve never written a review of anything before. My face was flawless after high school. Here and there I would break out but nothing major. I am now 25 and started suffering from acne located primarily on my jawline. It was awful! I spent a small fortune on products and nothing worked. I finally went to the doctor and was prescribed benzaclin and it is amazing! I have been on it for three weeks today exactly and my face is so clear. There was a little itching at first if I slathered on too much. Now I only use it as spot treatment and that works great too!""",4
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m an adult who has taken this off and on for 4 years.  I&#039;ve always had trouble concentrating and Focalin is an effective fix.  

I do think there are minor side-effects though.  It makes me feel much more focused and less worried/panicked about what I need to do.  Unlike other though I would not say it calms me down I feel like it actually stresses me out more.  When I take this I&#039;m more serious and easily annoyed and I can&#039;t relax.  I have also found that my appetite drops off and that I don&#039;t sleep very deeply.

Overall a great medicine but for me and many ADHD people our symptoms are brought out due to simply a lack of strenuous physical exercise (1hr) every day.  When on a regular exercise and sleep schedule I do not need it.""",1
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I am experiencing a major withdrawal or discontinuation syndrome from belviq. For three weeks I have had major anxiety, odd brain sensations, flu symptoms, numbness in my hands and feet, cough, earache... Just to name a few. I know that this syndrome is associated with SSRIs but this seems worse than what I have read about. I&#039;m wondering if the &#039;novelty&#039; of this agent means that they just don&#039;t know what to expect when people go off of it. I feel really stupid and I&#039;m soooo sick of feeling this bad. Praying these symptoms stop.""",2
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I have taken Lunesta 3mg for about 5 years now.  Never have had bad dreams or any instances of sleepwalking, etc.  I take it &amp; about 45 minutes later I am fast asleep until my alarm clock goes off.  Prior to finding Lunesta, I had insomnia for years &amp; I cannot tell you how much of a lifesaver this medicine has been!  Tried Ambien but it did not work for me at all.  Also tried Sonata, but would wake up a few hours after going to sleep.  I&#039;ve had no problems with tolerance, either.  The only &quot;bad&quot; thing is the crappy taste in one&#039;s mouth, but I discovered that brushing my tongue when I brush my teeth before going to bed gets rid of 90% of it, along with using Biotene mouthwash (the dry mouth brand).  Hooray!  My insurance will now cover it, too!""",0
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Seroquel for over 5 years, with varying doses ranging from 50 mg/day to 400 mg/day, for treatment resistent depression initially and bipolar disorder II recently, and it&#039;s been a gift from God. It doesn&#039;t cause the terrible inner restlessness that older antipsychotics or newer ones like Geodon, Risperdal, and Latuda produce, and it&#039;s effective against bipolar depression. I would give it a 10, but the side effects can be hard to deal with (drowsiness, tachycardia, BP changes).""",6
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I was taking regular Trazodone on and off for a couple of years, it stopped working so my doctor switched me to Desyrel. It&#039;s a good pill for the fact that it does make you tired, but I&#039;d make sure you&#039;re gonna get 8 or more hours of sleep before you take it. I was prescribed 100mg pills, and I only took half of a pill whenever I took it, and I had the hardest time waking up the next day. Also, with the reg Trazodone and with Desyrel, it took a long time for it to kick in for me (2  hours), but that might be because I have a high tolerance to pills. If you&#039;re new to this medicine, take it on the weekend, or whenever you can sleep in, so you can see how it works.""",0
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Geodon for 2 weeks yesterday 20mg x 2. And this is my first day on 40mg x 2 . So far I can&#039;t tell if in manic or getting better.

I just found out that i&#039;m pregnant, as they were in the process of getting me started to try accutaine...i&#039;m glad i was pregnant because, i&#039;d rather use this stuff if it works first, rather than a harsh med.  So hopefully this continues to help, and i will be sporting beautiful skin in a month or so.  I&#039;ve never had skin so smooth as it is already now, so i&#039;m super excited.

Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I heard from a bunch of mom friends IUDs were the way to go and really not very painful at all especially after you&#039;ve had kids. Well after a stupid amount of research I had it inserted February 24th 2017. Its March 7th 2017 and I have not stopped bleeding. The procedure was very painful for me but it was quick. My husband came with too. I don&#039;t think I could have driven myself after.  I did take ibuprofen like suggested an hour before and I have had two normal vaginal births of 8 pound boys. Also I have a bunch of piercings, tattoos, and broken bones. Thought I had a high pain tolerance. I&#039;ve been having mood swings and hot/cold sweats. Irritable/crying/sad mainly.

My 1st Rheumatologist put me on 7.5/750&#039;s 3 times daily and it worked well. After changing doctors after major Lung Surgery they sent me to a Pain Management doctor who put me on Duragesics then MS Contin. That sure got rid of the pain, but the depressant effects of Morphine based medications made me miserable. Hydrocodone or even Oxycodone work very well as long as you don&#039;t abuse them. I&#039;d wish more Pain Management people would get off the Morphine dependency. This kind of treatment makes it hard to treat pain after major surgeries.""",9
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Had the implant put in end of October 2014, since then I have;  gained 30 pounds, terrible mood swings,  depressed, always tired but have trouble sleeping,  and occasional pain in the arm near the implant.

I have not felt deprived and Belviq is keeping my hunger at bay.  I have not experienced any noticeable side effects.  I go back to my doctor in a month for a weigh-in.  I will re-post my results.  So far so good.  So far I would definitely recommend this drug.""",3

Belviq does curve your appetite but you also have to have will-power not to eat just because you see food.  Sometimes you don&#039;t have to be hungry to want food.  My goal is to be down 70 pounds by July! The only side effect that I have experienced so far was headaches and I just popped an ibuprofen and they are gone! May God help everyone on Belviq achieve their healthy goal!""",3
Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been using 2 mg of clonazepam at night for over 3 year with 60 mg of fluoxetine in the morning.  I have found I feel much better than the regimen of seroquel, clonazepam, wellbutrin, fluoxetine and atarax I was previously on.  I find the clonazepam works better than tegretol, valproic acid or lithium for me.  Clonazepam has anti-seizure properties as well as anxiolytic properties that work well for me along with with the mood lift Prozac gives.  I recommend it if you have Bipolar Disorder.""",6
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""So not worth it. I had all kinds of bad effects on the drug but I am here to warn you about stopping it. My doctor told me to stop it cold turkey. I figured since it was a selective SSRI I didn&#039;t have to taper. I have spent the next six weeks with profound problems with my heart rhythm.  Which my doctor thinks is unrelated. After 5 + weeks things seem to be calming a bit.  But not after all kinds of tests and a halter monitor and of course... that looks like your crazy.  I know it was this drug. The only time I ever had them before was after discontinuing Celexa without tapering. (when it was first introduced and they didn&#039;t know better).  I don&#039;t have palpitations normally.

I had energy, yes the first week I was shakey but that stops, I lost weight gained from conituning to eat like a weight lifting football player but had very little movement at all. I felt great, I can get things done now. Motivation is now just lacking from my lack of trying but when I get on something I blaze through it. Negative effects I have experienced are occasional moodiness, especially if I am focused on something and then get interrupted. Caffeine is a no no.""",1
Valium,Anxiety,"""My blood pressure was 270/120 and had to work through many drugs before this one lowered my anxiety and blood pressure. At 20 mg a day usually take all at night time for sleep to. Side effects sometimes headache. Strong addiction and should be weaned off it slowly or your head will hurt non stop for a month. A nightmare to stop cold. It lasts eight times longer than Xanax or Klonopin they are two brothers not to mess with. At first you may have the sedated effect before you become more resistant to the drug. Where you get the drug also makes a difference. Some stores give the yellow tablet which melts in mouth as clean as water. Other stores have an orange tablet that tastes like paper. Walmart has the good one and some grocery but not CVS.""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""This is it. You might have to up or decrease you mg according to how you feel at first. I take 3, 18mg tabs in morning. It is the Concerta ER, lasts from 8-12 hrs. No side effects at all for me. I am calmer, more focused, and still get a lot done during the day. I easily go to sleep now. Recommended for ADHD though, not for ADD symptoms. I am energized during the day and do not &quot;feel&quot; like I am &quot;coming off something&quot;. I highly recommend this.""",1
Ketorolac,Pain,"""Greatest medication I have ever taken. I suffer from severe headaches &amp; migraines that I have endured for at least 25 years now. Up until today I never experienced anything that gave me 100% relief from the pain, and it was delivered very quickly! Within 1 hour or less, I had complete pain relief that I had been suffering from this last time for 2 whole days.  I could not believe it.  In fact, I did not even recall the name of the injection that the doctor gave me, so I called the office back to get the name of this miracle - Toradol. I never had ANY side effects and will forever be grateful to the doctor for using this injection on me.""",9
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m on 60mg twice a day. I have been on Geodon for about 2 weeks. I am 42 and just diagnosed mixed mood bi-polar.

I am extremely agitated, with thoughts of rage running through my head more than not. I also sweat more, and am paranoid a lot. I want to give it some time, but don&#039;t know how long I can take these feelings.""",6
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I started Contrave in May, with the regular first month dosage.  I had some nausea, but found if it took it with lots of water and food, this would subside.  I also had some headaches, but that too went away with water.  I have been on the full strength drug now for 2 months and have lost 18 pounds.  I have learned to regulate the portions of my food and have to wait until my body tells me that I need to eat.  This is not miracle drug and works slow, but that is what I like, it is coming off and staying off.  I have not had to starve.  I feel like I am making good life choice changes and will continue.  Will report back later with more results!""",3
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I don&#039;t take this medication for weight loss, I take it to stay focused. I have ADHD and had it for years before it was ever defined, or diagnosed. The nuns tested me out of school, I started college early and graduated. What it does for me is level me out, by that I mean, I can do my job, keep order at my desk and function like a &quot;normal&quot; person. It helps with my impulsive tendencies. I feel more controlled and less agitated, it mellows me out. My job as a legal assistant/paralegal is defined by order and ability to concentrate, this drug has been a miracle for someone like me. I have no side effects and never have while taking it, I sleep whenever I want, I feel great, eat normally. Without this drug I don&#039;t know where I&#039;d be.""",3
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""Does it work?  You bet it does.  I have suffered from insomnia for 18 years so I know when I&#039;m asleep or not.  This med is wonderful in keeping you asleep for 5 1/2 to 6 hours.  This med is also effective in getting you to sleep.  The downside.  My God is it drowsy.  I&#039;m usually a guy who doesn&#039;t  complain but this med makes you super drowsy.  In addition to the drowsiness, it will make you irritable because you don&#039;t feel good.  In conclusion, I would recommend it because the psychological benefit of knowing you slept slightly outweighs its side effects.  I hope this info helps.  Best of dreams.""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""This is only the 2nd full day that I have been on Contrave and absolutely zero side effects.  After just one day I lost 2 pounds.  Contrave made it to where I wasn&#039;t even hungry.  I had to remember to eat lunch.  In the evening was  a little more difficult.  I was hungry, but I didn&#039;t gorge myself.  I am confidant that when I work up to the full dose twice a day, that may help my cravings in the afternoon/evening.  My doctor told me to take the evening dose about 30 minutes prior to supper.  I will post an update in a few weeks, but I am excited about this new drug.""",2
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been on vyvanse for about a year maybe a year and a half but damn this medication is amazing when you take it normally, I say normally because I usually only take it when I know I gotta focus so like for school, work, a project, etc but when I&#039;m just home I don&#039;t take it. Now vyvanse has helped me so so much its just the getting the medication on time is what I struggle with, because I&#039;ve noticed now that when I&#039;m off vyvanse my ADHD is way worse like the anger and getting distracted part. Yet I don&#039;t like taking pills in general I know they do damage inside but if it works it works you know I&#039;d rather struggle with the medication than have to deal with ADHD alone.""",1
Tapentadol,Pain,"""Nucynta has been a savior for me. I have  Fibromyalgia and it is not pleasant. Thank goodness my rhuematologist sent me to pain management and since being on Nucynta the pain has subsided. I still can&#039;t do what I used to do but no medicines take away Fibromyalgia. I&#039;m happy to be on Nucynta because for me it doesn&#039;t cause drowsiness like the others do. Maybe a little light headed but doesn&#039;t last long. I would recommend it. 2 months ago I broke my toe and Nucynta was awesome dulled the pain! So for me Nucynta has been very positive to me.""",9
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""First, the positive. I&#039;ve suffered from anxiety my entire life. This medication helped tremendously in that it was under control while I was on it. If you suffer from anxiety, you know how wonderful this can be.

The negative. I gained 20 pounds quickly that I couldn&#039;t get rid of. I decided to get off of the medication because I was trying to get pregnant. The withdrawals were really bad. I had brain zaps non-stop, couldn&#039;t stand up straight because of dizziness and extreme confusion. Now, keep in mind I tapered myself slowly off this medication, per doctor&#039;s orders. It took 5 months before I wasn&#039;t experiencing these withdrawal symptoms. Horrific.""",7
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I am 47 with such an exhausting history of anxiety that had led me to self medicate with alcohol, until finally finding the correct medical doctor.
Doctors in the past have been writing me scrips that have been making me crazier  and crazier, just adding to my problem. Now I am alcohol free with no panic attacks, I have no problems being by myself and keeping occupied with work and fun things to do. I sleep like a baby all through the night. It&#039;s wonderful.""",7
Accutane,Acne,"""Amazing difference in appearance in less than a month. I started breaking out about senior year in high school and it got progressively worse. Although makeup covered a lot of it, I never let anyone touch my face and dreaded having to go in the water and risk having my makeup rinsed off. Now my skin is 100% smooth and even after weening off of the pill to every other day I have not had a single blemish.""",4
Bupropion,Depression,"""I  started  Wellbutrin ER a few months ago for depression. I had no energy and wanted to do nothing.  It has helped so much with the depression but my hands tremor.  I tried cutting back to once a day and couldn&#039;t tell much difference in the tremors. I asked my doctor to give me the XR (150mg)  so that I could take it just once a day. I  felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. I could even feel my lips quivering.  I like that it makes me feel better but don&#039;t like the tremors. I can&#039;t find anything documented as to whether they will go away in time or continue as long as I take it. I haven&#039;t taken it today and I have no tremors.""",5
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""About 6 months in I began getting a little moody, but didn&#039;t think much of it. My periods have begun to get really heavy and I never know when they are going to stop or start. Sometimes it will last 4 or 5 days and sometimes I&#039;ll have my period for a month straight. My mood swings are absolutely terrible lately and I&#039;ve  had some depression (I&#039;m generally a very happy person). I have headaches regularly and have pregnancy symptoms all the time, such as sore breasts, spotting, bloating, and nausea. My boyfriend and I have barely been able to have sex because of the almost constant period, so no wonder you don&#039;t get pregnant! And my sex drive is much lower after getting it inserted.""",8
Concerta,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADD at the end of grade 6 and started taking concerta in grade 7. I had no idea I had ADD and just though everyone was like me. I had no enthusiasm anything with school but after I took concerta I was like ADHD. So much hyperness and wanting to work. After raising the dose to 36mg I started to get very anxious about my heart feeling like it was beating too fast and was having like a panic attack or something so then I dropped back down to 27mg. The side affects I have is weight loss/loss of appitite, heart palpitations, sleep paraylisis, feelings of excitement. It works for me but I hate the side affects. I also lost 5lbs in one week when I first started and 20lbs in 2 years.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking phentermine on October 18, 2008. At that time, I weighed in at 263 lbs. I&#039;m 5&#039;10 so I carry weight very well. As of my weigh in yesterday (April 30, 2009) I&#039;ve lost 41 lbs. The only side effect that I&#039;ve had to deal with is insomnia; but over time, that has gotten easier to deal with. I&#039;d recommend this medication; however, I would also stress that the weight you put on wasn&#039;t put on overnight and therefore, won&#039;t come off overnight. Slow and steady wins the race.""",3
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Been on Vyvanse for three months now. I&#039;m 6 foot 195 pounds and 20 years old but find even the 30 mg dosage to be more than enough for me. Experience occasional bouts of dizziness and when in stressful situation have some degree of chest pains. Lasts more than the full 12 hours for me. I have to wake up at 8 am in order to fall asleep around 1 AM.  Also when I take Vyvanse I notice some degree of hair loss. I feel as if my brain is telling my body to work and as a result my body is working in triple overtime to keep up.""",1
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Gained weight from the depo shot. Went from 110 to 173 in 9 months! I&#039;m 22 and only 5&#039;2 &amp; 1/2. I have done everything. Countless gym memberships, fad diets, personal trainers and programs like Weight Watcher and It Works. I went from 173 to 123 from tons of different methods over the course of a year and a half to two. Now, a few months ago the doctor put me back on Celexa. I went from 123 to 143 within a month and a half.. Not happy after all of my hard work. I&#039;ve already worked my butt off to lose weight, lost what I wanted to and then gained 20 back from another medication. My doctor understood my frustration and started me on Belviq August 1st. August 7th.. I am down 5.4 pounds!!! I walk 2 miles a night, only drink water. Love it!!!!!""",3
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Another toxic drug- BUT....
I rated Trazodone mid level because it has helped me get some resemblance of consistent sleep 
( 2-3 hrs at times) that I likely would not otherwise have received without it. I have been on it for about 6-8 years, and have tried everything else known to man ( except odd street drugs) I am a 51 year old woman who strongly dislikes drugs to begin with.
I was prescribed this after asking for 
&quot; something to help me sleep&quot; while I was in the hospital after surgery-after breaking down to my doctor because I was at my wits end, I was not sleeping-I was not I informed at the time this was an antidepressant! 
My body was already used to them """,0
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My son is on Vyvanse, now so am I. First, my head is clear for the first time ever. No 90 mile an hour uncontrollable though, no wondering ideas, no day dreaming. I don&#039;t feel drugged. In fact, I feel drugged when I&#039;m not on medicines now. I didn&#039;t know what it was like to be &quot;normal&quot; prior to this medicine. The only issue I have is the stomach problems. Some slight stomach pain and bowel issues. I also stopped drinking caffeine and have adjusted my diet to be more well balanced. It&#039;s helped a lot. If you&#039;re new to Vyvanse, don&#039;t drink caffeine! Water only, and adjust your diet for high protein in the morning, it&#039;s a must.  Change your diet and quick.""",1
Tramadol,Pain,"""I was put on tramadol 100mg SR about 9 months ago for a very painful hip bursa and thin tendons. I was too afraid to get a cortisone injection. It made me feel strange at first and bad headaches. I already suffer depression and it seemed to help me out there as well as soothing my pain. I had no idea it was addictive. I have read so many horror stories about this drug that I don&#039;t want it anymore. I&#039;m now taking myself off it slowly. I was only taking one tablet each morning and sometimes one at night if the pain was bad. I&#039;ve started taking one every other day and my lord even that is so noticeable. Now I&#039;m in  pain and also very highly strung, I&#039;m going to build it so I can go more days without it until I&#039;m off it. Please think very hard before taking.""",9
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal worked like a charm on my mood. I so pleasantly surprised and relieved! I&#039;ve tried something like 10 medications in an 11-year period and it&#039;s been the only thing that&#039;s worked. However, it gave me really bad back acne (like, whoa) and made me very physically ill- super swollen lymph nodes in my neck, fever, vomiting &amp; fatigue, etc. I had to stop taking it, but I&#039;d say it&#039;s definitely worth a try. In general I&#039;m very susceptible to side effects. I have hypomania, depression, anxiety, ADHD, my mood is super unstable, and Lamictal was prescribed to me because my doctor wanted to stabilize my mood before putting me on a stimulant since stimulants by themselves make me way too hyper.""",6
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""Gives me some energy, but causes unwanted anxiety at uncomfortable times. I&#039;ve been on it since the 2/7/17 and haven&#039;t lost any weight. Although I do eat less. I wake up several times during the night now as well. If I take it first thing in the morning it gives me horrible stomach issues, if I wait til lunch I&#039;m up all night. I take it with a snack around 10:00am. It&#039;s been almost a month and a half, we&#039;ll see.""",3
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""The worst weight loss pill did not lose a pound but sure gained... I had been with a different doctor had to switch not happy about doing so and new doctor would not renew the pill I was taking insisted I take BELVIQ not only did I have to jump through hoops to get, I also had to pay out of pocket $100 for and gained weight . Even thought I was over weight I have still been walking but still put on 10lbs of what I had lost on other drug. I craved food it was horrible so now what for me find New doctor that will work with me and give me something that will help. I&#039;m not looking to loose over night I just need a little help being over 50 I was told I eat to much fruit and that was a big problem for me I&#039;m not a big eater really .""",3
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""This is a great medicine. I have known that my daughter now 7, has always been extremely energetic and talkative her entire life, but her impulsivity, inability to concentrate on work (or play), and energy were really interfering with her school and home life. I was so stressed out every day. The behavioral problems were never ending. I mean this child was ALWAYS in trouble, poor girl! She is now like the little girl that I always knew was hiding away in there, but would only rarely come out, she has all of the same positive personality traits plus more. I feel like I can finally connect with her, like her brain just clicked and she is now living in the same reality as everyone around her instead of lost in her  mind. It does make her sleepy.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I just started taking the pill on July 23 and I weigh 178, today is July 26 and I now weigh 174.  If you have dry mouth try chewing sugar free gum as a singer I use that trick all the time to keep my mouth moist and it works. Please drink lots of water as well, but it makes the dry mouth not so bad.  I have a thyroid condition so I take that pill early in the morning and I make myself eat a piece of toast or something 30 minutes later and take the pill and I don&#039;t have a problem sleeping at night.  I walk every other day and I have a decrease in my appetite, but I still eat. Some people say that don&#039;t eat at all that is not healthy.  Oh and I don&#039;t drink or eat anything with caffeine so I won&#039;t have a problem sleeping at night with the meds""",3
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I suffer from insomnia derived from an anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. I have taken trazodone 50mg for sleep for 10 days. The first night, I slept for 13 hours straight. I was extremely fatigued throughout the day for the first 4-5 days on this drug, but I was sleeping through the night for the first time in months, so that side effect was worth it to me. Last night, I took the 50mg tablet, laid down to sleep, and woke up refreshed 9 hours later. No fatigue today whatsoever. This is the first time in a very long time that I woke up feeling well rested and (dare I say it) almost cheerful. Take it a good hour before you want to be asleep in order to avoid tossing and turning at first.""",0
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I started taking it 2 weeks ago through Medicenter weight loss clinic and I lost 9.6lbs the 1st week and 4.8 this week.  I have a lot of energy which is helping me to exercise again. I have never been someone who takes medication so this is very hard for me but the results are on the scale.  I am hoping to lose another 30lbs over the next 2 months and then get off the pills and head back to Weight Watchers for the last 15!""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Easy method reliable.
Increased back pain, mood swings, no sex drive at all, weight gain and hard to shift even with controlled eating and 5 days gym training. Good for 6 months then constant bleeding. Always tired, early removal and most things have changed for the better but the withdrawal on it (only 1 week) causing depression for no reason even with no history of it before considering 90% of my life is perfect""",8
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""It seem to start out good, then I noticed I was bruising very easy and with my period and or if i cut my self I was bleeding pretty bad. Went to ER one weekend because I felt so bad and my blood count platelets where 53.  I have been battling that for the past month saw the hemotologist today I have been off the med for a month blood count is slowly going back up. Just be careful and watch for the side effects.""",3
Duloxetine,Depression,"""Switched onto Cymbalta after many years on Lexapro (which became ineffective). Gradually increased to 60mg/ day, taken in the morning. Initial side effects were tolerable, (sleepy, spaced-out) but as a student I need to be awake and focused. My MD suggested taking the medicine prior to bedtime- it definitely helped! Now I am able to wake up and function properly everyday without the frustrating aspects of depression!""",5
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I have been on Tenuate for a year and at first I was losing weight fast (30lbs) and looked great but by 6 months I had stopped losing so my dr took me off it for 3 months. I got back on after I gained back 20 of the 30lbs lost. This was during summer and I have two kids I&#039;m constantly chasing. I&#039;ve been back on Tenuate for 3 months and I have gained another 6lbs WHILE ON TENUATE!!! I have a healthy diet and exercise regularly. So, if you want to lose weight for a specific occasion this med is great for you but if you want something to help you keep it off....this might not be it.""",2
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""The generic for this med didn&#039;t work at all, however the name brand (for some reason) is amazing! It has changed my life after so many other meds have failed. I am able to study, take notes, and remember what I&#039;ve read now. The only reason I did not give it a 10 is because I am having some issues with insomnia. I&#039;m sure that is related to the timing and strength of my last dose of the day however, and will adjusted. It can be expensive, however after trying everything else and nothing else working, I would rather pay for this than deal with awful symptoms all day.""",1
Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on venlafaxine for almost 10 years. After being diagnosed with severe depression when I was in my twenties, I was prescribed Prozac on which I couldn&#039;t function, and then Paxil which worked okay at first.  Several years later after years of both manic and depressive episodes,  the worst  full-blown manic episode got me re-diagnosed as bi-polar. I was prescribed venlafaxine, a very small dose which made me violently ill for over 2 weeks, but after that, it improved and I felt better. My dosage has been upped numerous times. I am now at 225 mg and have been for a couple of years. It has been a life saver. I feel like I have a new life; one without rages, anxiety, and depression. My family is much more stable now that I am stable.""",6
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""I had been experiencing post partum anxiety and severe insomnia for a few weeks.
After having tried almost every natural alternative out there, I was becoming increasingly desperate.
Reading of the experiences of other mums in my situation and what worked for them, I decided to mention this medication to my new doctor and thankfully, he agreed to give it a try (SSRIs had never worked for me in the past and had made my anxiety 10X worse).
The 15mgs I take nightly have been a godsend. Despite the slight wooziness after the initial dose, I now sleep so well &amp; can throughly enjoy my waking life with my baby again!
Highly recommended to other mums with these same symptoms.""",7
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""Was totally down in the dumps for some reason even though my life was great. Finally I could take no more as my mind was giving me nasty thoughts to end things. Immediately went to the doctors and he prescribed me 50 mg Pristiq which sent my mind out of control. Now my whole being was in trouble and refusing to go to work and being around my family. Immediately back to the doctors to be put on 100 mg and I can say I have never looked back. Totally changed my life as I am myself again. Yeah a few sexual side effects but I can live with that I&#039;m just glad to be back .""",5
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 3 years ago during a hospitalization. Was put on 600mg Seroquel and 200mg Lamictal. Switched doctors and they decided to replace my medicines with lithium. I don&#039;t know why but it made my condition 10 times worse and I got very sick.  Fever, vomiting, nausea, drowsiness, fatigue, excessive thirst and urination. Plus it makes my mood swings much worse and shortened my patience and turned my depression to rage. Gave uncontrollable twitches and body movements and shaky hands. Though I have been off it for a year. My case is probably an anomaly as it seems to work wonders for everyone else. """,6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Everyone talks about this amazing energy boost I have yet to experience that it does curb my appetite but it&#039;s also a lot of will power once some pounds came off I was more motivated in the gym I lost 30 pounds the first time around so was 230 stopped taking them and gained 21 pounds back but I also have pretty bad depression and was going though relationship issues and literally didn&#039;t step foot in the gym for months it works if you put in the work too""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal has been a major eye opener for me. I was astonished when the medication started to take effect (within a week or two), at how my condition was affecting my daily life. Since being on 200 mg per day I am able to wake up on time for work, attend my softball and hockey games, socialize with my friends, and take control of my life. I&#039;ve spent the last 3 to 4 years in constant turmoil, jumping from medication to medication, trying various cocktails. Most of these had major side ffects that made them unbearable in the long run. Lamictal on the other hand has virtually 0 side effects, and almost 100% symptom control. I would recommend it to anyone suffering with Bipolar II.""",6
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""Hi I really wanted to share my experience as I read so many reviews that made me scared to take this drug. I switched after citalopram stopped working for me. I am now 4 months in and on 50mg (started on 20 and increased slowly) I have had no side effects with this drug apart from a dry mouth for about 2 days. My anxiety improved within days, not an instant cure but I was coping better. I feel that I am nearly back to normal now after what a period of crippling anxiety. I still feel worried sometimes but can now rationalise thing and the intrusive thoughts are about gone (fingers crossed!) I wanted to leave a positive review the reviews I read terrified me.""",7
Qsymia,Obesity,"""My doctor was pretty hesitant to try me on this but was quick to mention weight loss surgery. I&#039;m 25, 5&#039;8&quot; with a starting weight of 250 (June 8th). I began the low dose of the trial of June 13th and weighed yesterday at 241.5 (8.5 lbs!). Soda tastes flat and so does alcohol. Huge bonus since soda was my vice. Drinking lots of water due to dry mouth. I have felt a little tired, but it&#039;s tolerable. My hands and face feel tingly today. hopefully that passes because that is pretty annoying. I had a slight headache the first two days, but that went away with Aleve. I see my doctor on the 26th for a 30 day fill. Hopefully the weight loss continues. I don&#039;t plan on taking for more than a couple months. Will update.""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been on Saxenda for 3 weeks now. The first week I experienced very little side effects which was relieving as I usually get very sick from medications. By the end of week one the smallest portions would fill me up which is wonderful but I had no weight loss and I was eating strictly healthy. Week 2 I stuck to .06 for an extra week so my body could adjust better and finished the week with 3 lbs lost since start date. Almost no desire to ever eat. Week three I have increased my dosage and have been feeling extremely nauseous and having weird chest pains. I hope it goes away. I&#039;m a little uncomfortable with the possible long term side effects and will only stick this out if I start seeing results. Happy with appetite decrease though.""",2
Focalin XR,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 7. I started with Concerta to treat it but as time went on the side effects and the dosage being 135mg was getting annoying. I have noticed that Focalin XR has fewer side effects than Concerta. Also, I eat a good deal more and I can sleep when taking it. I also read in the comments that the maximum dosage is 20mg? I take 35mg and will probably up my dose. Other than that it is a very good medication.""",1
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda in on 11/9 Thursday. First dose .6 at the doctors office weighed in at 228.6. Got a headache immediately but went away that evening. Today is 11/11 Saturday I administer in the mornings. No side effects so far, except a little more energy.  I weighed my self today and 230.2. Way to early to judge, but my cravings for starch and sugar are gone and food is starting to look and taste weird. My food portion intake is definitely less almost a struggle to eat. I will update each week.""",2
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have never experienced any hallucinogenic side effects from this drug, but I admit I&#039;ve developed a nasty dependency to 100 mgs/night. It is the only sleep aid that doesn&#039;t give me cotton mouth or drowsiness the next day and works like a charm every single time.  Nothing even comes close to its effectiveness. Note:  It IS imperative that you take it at once you are in bed and ready to sleep.  After that you aren&#039;t going anywhere, no sleep walking, driving or binge eating.""",0
Accutane,Acne,"""At the age of 30, I still dealt with breakouts. After trying all sorts of over the counter products that just hurt me I went to the doctor. We took the steps of prescription washes and antibiotics. Still had breakouts. So decided to try Accutane. I&#039;m currently starting my 5th month, and I haven&#039;t had a breakout or a single pimple in over 3 months. My side effects were dry peeling lips ( nothing Carmex can&#039;t fix), dry eyes, very sensitive skin (though working in a hospital doesn&#039;t help) so far I am so satisfied with this medicine. Yes, it is a hassle to get but worth it.""",4
Orlistat,Obesity,"""Once again I fell for a product despite knowing better. There is no such thing as a weight loss pill. Nothing. Weight loss comes from modified diet and exercise. There&#039;s no magic pill. Not only didn&#039;t I lose any weight... I GAINED another 10 lbs.

This was a waste of money and I suspect messed with my metabolism in the process. The makers of this placebo should refund all our money. Total con.""",2
Bupropion,Depression,"""I&#039;ve only been on bupropion for 3 weeks. It&#039;s 150xl. I haven&#039;t noticed any appetite suppression per say..it&#039;s easier to &quot;say no&quot; to myself but it&#039;s me choosing. So, maybe I guess *shrug* I have noticed that it begins to wear off around 5pm-6pm when I take it in the morning. It&#039;s a notable difference at that point. I&#039;m going to ask about upping the dose. 

Also, a side effect I&#039;ve noticed: I&#039;M LOSING MY HAIR!! by the damn fist full each time I shower..it&#039;s thinning in the front. But I love how I feel, so I&#039;m not sure what to do. If that shows how poorly I felt. I&#039;d rather lose hair than feel the way I did. Maybe I&#039;ll ask what can be done..""",5
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I retired over 3 yrs. ago and almost immediately my schedule began to change, ending up in a situation in which I couldn&#039;t fall asleep sometimes until as late 5 or 6 am, and not get up until around noon!  Yesterday my lung doc, who also does sleep studies, suggested doxepin.  I had already had a bad experience with it many years ago - 10 mg. It put me to sleep alright, but I felt like a frigging zombie the next day .He told me that was too strong a dose and recommended half of that.  He also told me that most insurance companies won&#039;t pay for it in any dose except the generic 10 mg. capsule.  Not the 3mg. tablet or the liquid. So, I half the caps nightly in water. Slept fine;no hangover. Retired 11:30 &amp; up @ 8.Hope tonight&#039;s same. Dose is key!""",0
Lutera,Birth Control,"""After I took lutera, within an hour I would feel a rush of fatigue and want to sleep. I would end up taking two, three hour long naps- which threw off my sleep cycle. My breasts hurt, and I was extremely aggressive during my month on this pill. Toward the end I started spotting the 4th day of the third week, and I am on the 3rd day of my period week- and so far I have been spotting for 7 days. My acne got worse, when this was supposed to help. I did not experience bleeding at first. Wouldn&#039;t recommend this pill. I am switching to Yaz.""",8
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on Latuda for several months, recently increased to 60 mg.  At first, I thought it was pretty good, subtle improvements.  Now it&#039;s hard to say.  I have intense intrusive thoughts every day, suicidal and I&#039;ve begun hearing music in the distance (like tinnitus, but music instead of ringing.)  The former two existed to some degree before I started Latuda, the latter is brand new.  Most noted side effect:  EXTREMELY sedating for 2-3 hours abruptly followed by intense restlessness, need to move.  Haven&#039;t figured out a good time of day to take it for this reason. Take it in the morning, I&#039;m fighting drowsiness half the day.  Take it in the evening, I&#039;m wide awake until 2 AM.  Also, nausea.  Other medicines I take: Lamictal, Prozac, Cardizem, Ativan.""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started Contrave in early February, at first I did not lose any weight but I could feel myself getting fuller faster especially as the dosage increased. For the month I have been on the full dosage I have lost 20 pounds. Sometimes I do not have a desire to eat, often this is due to nausea. I have felt more energized and motivated to work out. The only side effects I continue to have are a dry mouth and trouble sleeping. Both problems are well worth it to me.""",2
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""If your face doesn&#039;t respond to over the counter products, you don&#039;t need to try everything out there.  ProActiv, SkinID, OXY, they are all the same!  Don&#039;t hesitate to try this miracle drug.  Pay attention to the side effects, of course, but this is not just a treatment, it is a cure.  I had severe acne from 16 - 20 and I tried everything!  Doctors were so reluctant to use this Accutane, keeping it as a last resort.  Once they were finally convinced I wasn&#039;t responding to anything else, and that I wouldn&#039;t just outgrow it, they finally put me on it, and the results were dramatic.  Within weeks, I could actually feel the change in my skin.  My skin finally felt normal, instead of greasy and painful.  I wasn&#039;t afraid to touch it anymore.""",4
OxyContin,Pain,"""I started taking Oxycontin over 3 years ago for chronic pain in my back and left leg and foot. I have peripheral neuropathy, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, sciatic nerve injury, drop foot and have been told I have pinched nerves. All I know is that I have pain. I started taking 40 mg 3 times a day then 80mg twice a day and now my doctor has me on morphine sulphate 100 mg 3 times a day. He said to do this I won&#039;t need to continue raising the dose of the Oxycontin. The morphine sulphate has not helped as much as the Oxycontin.""",9
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am being court ordered to take this prescribed medication. I don&#039;t like taking any drug. The side effects I have are lethargy, diziness, my tongue doesn&#039;t work at times, I have knots in my stomach, headache, I sleep for more than half the day, lower back pain and leg pain and cramping. I am prescribed 25mg but I break the pill in half so I am only taking half per day. I am less angry maybe because I have no desire to do anything. I have been taking the drug for five months now. I just want to be drug free. I don&#039;t think I will check this site again but I would like some responses.""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""I was a bit nervous about starting contrave due to all the listed side affects which sound scary. My healthcare professional said the suicidal thoughts would probably occur in someone under 18 y/o. She didn&#039;t have any comment on the part about seizures. Sister and I tried it on the same day. Sister took hers and panicked, thought she was dying so she didn&#039;t take any more. I have a high tolerance for everything so the dizziness and sudden nausousness didn&#039;t alarm me as much. Make sure you don&#039;t have anywhere to go when you 1st try it. First week was a little rough, I got immune to it. It does suppress my appetite but not much. I&#039;ve lost inches b/c I have energy to go to the gym now but my weight is about  the same as it was 2 months ago.""",2
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""I have Bipolar and ADD, the antidepressants compromised my ability to focus and think cogently. I tried ritalin and adderall but with little improvement. Focalin gives me a good 4 hours of ability to concentrate on cognitively demanding tasks. I&#039;m a college professor and I can vary the dosage slightly depending on the demands of my day/tasks with doctor&#039;s approval. This med. works very well, but wears off after about 4 hours and can leave me feeling drained. Overall, it&#039;s really helpful. Has not affected or caused any mania.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""Im 20 and Im on week 4( 2 pills in the morning and 2 at night) i am 16 pounds down already. I am experiencing mild nausea, but it&#039;s only when I eat certain things. Once I throw up, I feel much better. I am trying to include more fruit into my diet to compensate for the food I have been throwing up. I have heard these symptoms don&#039;t last but 2 weeks max. If they last longer than that, I&#039;m going to go back to the 2 pills in the morning and 1 at night since I did good during that. This pill has been great at eliminating my cravings. No constipation or headaches so far.""",2
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I was on Victoza for about a little over a year. I had lost 128lbs . it worked great for me.  I went off to see if I would gain it all back.  To be honest I didn&#039;t add exercise to my daily routine as I worked in construction at the time.( I am a female) . I didn&#039;t diet. I am not the best example to learn from.  My weight loss was strictly from the effects of Victoza curbing my appetite.  Anyway..after agonist 3years being off...I didn&#039;t gain any weight back until my mother was dying and I think I was stress eating.. I gained about 60lbs.  I&#039;m getting ready to start Victoza again.""",3
Concerta,ADHD,"""I have been taking Concerta for (ADHD) about 3 months now.  The effects have been both positive and negative.  I started off with 36 mg and my grades were increasing rapidly, and I was more focused, but I started to become more antisocial, angry, I didn&#039;t have an appetite, I had sleeping problems and depression.  Then about two weeks ago I switched to 54 mg due to lack of focus, and my stomach has been troubling me. I&#039;m having twitching problems, and I am hearing voices.""",1
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""I have chronic back pain that I take a pain medicine for. (Nucynta- and it&#039;s great!). I still had a problem with falling asleep so my pain doctor suggested I try this. It has changed my life. It is so amazing how it works. You really don&#039;t know it&#039;s working until you lie down and try to go to sleep. This pill doesn&#039;t give you the normal feelings of getting sleepy like the others. This is working your brain to shut down in such a cool way you hardly know it unless you stay up waiting for that feeling. I think if I didn&#039;t have the back pain I would probably sleep straight through the night but my pain meds run out after 5hrs so I have to take one again for that. No probs going back to sleep. I get a lot of memory loss on the night before though.

Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I have been on Cymbalta for about 4 months now, and finally can say that it is worth going through some of the beginning side effects.  We must be careful though, to listen to our bodies first.  Side effects can be bothersome but should not be unbearable, so if this is your case with Cymbalta or any other medication, you must consult your physician.  When I first started Cymbalta, (which I did twice before finally staying on it) I could not sleep, had headaches, and could not even drink a cup of coffee without feeling as if I was hyper.  Eventually, things got better and I was able to stop the additional medication that was prescribed to help me sleep.  Switching Cymbalta to bedtime helped tremendously!  No pain and/or anxiety.""",7
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""When I started having severe anxiety and panic attacks years ago I had a doctor who had no difficulty shoving me on Xanax and Klonopin. I was completely unaware how addictive and awful these drugs were. I weaned myself of the drugs after years of taking them. After withdrawal I did fine. About a year ago my anxiety and panic attacks returned and I was going to a different doctor. She tried me on Zoloft first and very sparingly gave me Xanax for those &quot;I&#039;m going to die moments&quot;. After about 3 months the Zoloft wasn&#039;t helping much without the occasional Xanax kick so she doubled the Zoloft and I about crawled out of my skin. She asked me if I want to try Buspiron. No anxiety and sleeping like a baby.""",7
Ativan,Anxiety,"""I started taking Ativan about 3 months ago for extreme anxiety. I couldn&#039;t sleep, eat, or get anything done. I was seeing a CBT therapist but even my therapy wasn&#039;t helping. My doctor prescribed Ativan and my dad, who is a psychologist, agreed. It&#039;s for the worst moments when I feel like I&#039;m either going to go to the hospital or just completely go crazy. For that purpose it works very well. I feel relaxed in about a half hour and can function again. I don&#039;t take it every day or every week but I can&#039;t imagine being addicted to something if it makes you feel normal. I don&#039;t feel high or anything. I&#039;m so glad I was prescribed this and decided to take it.""",7
Paxil,Depression,"""Paxil helped me get my life and emotions back on track after depression linked to a divorce. I had been feeling more down than ever before, and couldn&#039;t shake it despite every effort through talk counseling, relaxation, and exercise. For the first 3-4 weeks, initially at 10 mg and then at 20 mg, I felt that Paxil was having no effect on me. But as it kicked in, I felt happier, more myself, and more alive than in years, sustained now for 3 months. It&#039;s been a very natural feeling, as if a fog has lifted rather than any medicated fakeness. Only side effect has been gaining 15 pounds (after losing 10 pounds from depression), even while training for and running a half-marathon. No difficulty cutting dosage to 15mg, and will soon cut to 10mg.""",5
Intuniv,ADHD,"""We began with night wakings then more aggression. He was never aggressive like this before. Raised to 2 mg symptoms increased again. Still hyper and seemed worse than before. Upon reducing back to 1 mg to none it&#039;s been a nightmare. Red red cheeks. Bouncing off walls. Bouncing Up till 3 am. Starting to come down a bit but oh my god the havoc on his mind and body and us plus no sleep. Doc said there wouldn&#039;t be any withdrawal """,1
Minocycline,Acne,"""I have been on this medicine for about 2 weeks and have actually broken out even worse than when I first started. It could possibly be that the medicine is bringing up all the pimples? My primary care doctor prescribed this until I see an actual dermatologist. I do have an appointment next week with one so hopefully they will prescribe be something better. But with this medicine I have been feeling very nauseous and slight headaches.""",4
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""I would recommend this to everyone,
My experience on the shot has been great. This is about my 9th month now and I never had to deal with any crazy side effects like weight gain, acne, etc. 
However, In the first 3 months I did have mood swings but they were never worse than any normal mood swings (for example period mood swings.) and I never got my period, bleeding, or any sporting till 6 months after I started the shot! And even then.. My period was very light and quick. Be sure to drink a lot of milk or eat dairy to replace the calcium that gets stripped from your body by taking the shot. If you don&#039;t replace your calcium, your bones can become weak or you can experience more side effects. Just take care of yourself :)""",8

Side effects for me include super dry mouth and sleeplessness but as long at I work out the sleeplessness is not a issues only a problem when I haven&#039;t excersise. Best of luck all""",3
Strattera,ADHD,"""I was started on Strattera almost 3 years ago.  Before taking this medication I was constantly on rabbit trails couldn&#039;t finish a project and trying to do 3 or 4 things at the same time, which I wasn&#039;t doing very well.  I&#039;ve probably been ADHD all my life but was not diagnosed until I was 50.  I have gone back to school and work as an inpatient crisis stabilization nurse.  I should be the poster child for this medication because it has been a miracle for me.  I take 100 mg of the medication a day.  The only thing I can complain about is the medication wears off sometimes before I get off of work. This probably could be fixed with a simple medication time and dosage change.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve struggled with weight my whole life and I&#039;m only 22. My senior year of high school was the best I&#039;ve looked in entire life. I work out 3 times a week and eat fairly healthy. My doctor prescribed me this 1/25/17 and so far I feel great. I am 5&#039;2 and 198 as of right now. I struggle with deep depression and anxiety and I have been having really bad days. Today is the best day I&#039;ve had in a few months. I have had cotton mouth all day and felt jittery but that&#039;s okay with me since it&#039;s the most energy I&#039;ve had in a while. I will update my weight in a week!""",3
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I started Qsymia on 1/21/16 and it was prescribed by my endocrinologist. I&#039;m still taking the starter dose of 3.75/23. I&#039;ve lost 10 lbs in 6 days! I have not been hungry and have had very few cravings. I&#039;ve EASILY maintained a 1200 calorie diet for the past six days and have been exercising by walking (12000 average steps/day). I have one more week left of this dose and then I&#039;ll start the 7.5 mg recommended dose. I&#039;m 5&#039;11, starting weight was 235, current weight 226, and goal weight is 175. I&#039;m so glad that I&#039;ve started this medication.""",2
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;m into month three with Contrave. It&#039;s has curbed my cravings for sweets. Food was constantly on my mind, and now food doesn&#039;t own me. That alone is a miracle. I have only lost 10 pounds but that is my fault since I still eat burgers (albeit not the whole thing like before) and haven&#039;t exercised. But I haven&#039;t gained weight which is what I was doing beforehand. I&#039;m just happy having a &#039;normal&#039; relationship with food now.""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 18 years old, I&#039;ve been on this birth control (aka bc) since I was 13. I was diagnosed with severe chronic migraines because of my period well one way to stop it was taking this bc, and not getting pregnant. Anyways, it stopped my migraines and headaches I didn&#039;t have cramps much anymore, I use to wear night pads during the day because of how heavy my flow was and now I get my period maybe every 3 months and its only for a couple of days. I haven&#039;t experienced any weight gain or hair loss! I love it! But it is different for everyone like when I first got it, I had my period not kidding you, 5 months straight, IT WAS HELL! but after that 5 months I didn&#039;t have a period for over a year! It really works""",8
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Yes, this medication works. It works very well for chronic anxiety disorder and  sudden onsets of severe panic attacks. Knowing what I know now, I wish with all my being it had never ever been prescribed to me, and without the absurd nonchalance dozens of practitioners have portrayed. 
I&#039;m 32 and have been prescribed clonazopam for 14 years. Ive been in situations where my health insurance is in transition and I must go off the medication abruptly-- this is when I realized how deep I was. Weeks upon weeks of non stop physical, emotional, and psychological withdrawal effects that are like hell. Words cannot accurately describe just how awful it is. This, again, has been my experience during withdrawal as a long term clonazopam patient. 
All skin, especially the face, becomes numb. Vision gets fuzzy and difficult to see clearly. Panic attacks become extremely exasperated, frequent and debilitating. Severe irritability. Worst of all: a terrifying disconnection between your mind and body; as if you&#039;re an onlooker watching and feeling this horrible thing happen to you, but not actually feeling connected to any of it-- that one is tough to explain. All of this... It can lasts months, maybe more. That&#039;s right. Not just some one week hump to overcome. 
After finding how awful the withdrawal is I&#039;ve been attempting to ween very very slowly down from 3 2mg doses per day to eventually zero, hopefully. After six months of gradually decreases in dose I&#039;m now at 2- 1mg doses per day and I&#039;m not sure how or if I can go much less than that. No doctors I&#039;ve had have been of any help. The ween down was my idea and the rate of it was also my idea based on experience. It sure would be nice to meet a doctor that truly had knowledge of this withdrawal syndrome and took it a bit more seriously. I am confident that the medication is no longer treating my anxiety disorder, but simply preventing withdrawal from the meds themselves. And there don&#039;t seem to be any good alternatives. It&#039;s a long road ahead, please think it over and over with someone knowledgeable before being so quick to embrace this miracle drug. The truth is that most of us actually need very real psychotherapy, not chemicals that run our lives. 
Once again, all my point of view from my personal experience. It feels very good to share this.""",7
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Preface: first form of birth control I&#039;ve ever had. 

Well, the appointment and procedure were fine. Pap position, they cleaned my cervix, stretched it out, measured my uterus, and installed it. I forgot to take Advil prior. I think my doctor was expecting me to be dizzy and nauseous after, but I sat up immediately feeling the same as before. My only concern: strings. Doctor said I should check daily, I should feel them. I haven&#039;t been able to feel them so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s in or out. I would recommend having a laxitive (colrite from Rite-Aid) handy. My cramps were from being constipated.

All of you ladies wanting this will be fine. As of March 3rd, 2016, I have experienced no headache, dizziness, nausea, nothing. I recommend Skyla.""",8
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""This medication has helped me immensely!  I tried Lexapro, but had too many negative side effects.  Effexor took about 6 weeks to fully work, but it really brought me out of the depths of my anxirty fuelled depression.  I finally feel myself after many years of living in the fog.  The side effects for the first 2 weeks for me were: insomnia, increased anxiety/depression, hot flashes, and nausea.  These all disappeared after the initial 2 weeks and it&#039;s totally worth getting through that rough patch.  Once Effexor started working I thought, OMG! I&#039;m back!  My body is dependent on it, though.  If I miss a dose, I get dizzy and nauseous.  Just know you must wean yourself off and not go cold turkey so you don&#039;t feel sick.""",7
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Once you find the right dosage for you, trazodone will put you to sleep. I&#039;m no stranger to sedatives - I&#039;ve taken Klonopin, Valium, Xanax, diphenhydramine, etc. None of those medications made me as clumsy as trazodone. I was falling over objects in the house and running into walls. I also felt my mental capabilities decrease - trying to complete a full sentence was a daunting task. Additionally, I experienced muscles aches, just like the side effects say. They were so bad that I could not even get out of bed and had to miss work.

It&#039;s unfortunate that doctors don&#039;t like to prescribe benzodiazepines. They helped me a lot than trazodone.""",0
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""Was prescribed melatonin by my doctor about 2 months ago. Due to anxiety, and tinnitus I hadn&#039;t been sleeping until around 6-7am or not at all. Having university the next day was a big pain, when I had no sleep and had to be able to focus for the rest of the day. I had been on many different medications before for both anxiety and insomnia, some of which worked but all had bad side effects. 
Melatonin works extremely well for me, with no noticeable side effects. I take 2 mg two hours before bed, and it works well. I normally get a good 7-9 hours sleep when I take melatonin and don&#039;t feel drowsy the next day.""",0
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""This was a nightmarish experience for me. I ran out of my regular Temazepam and forgot to pick it up at the pharmacy, so I popped a 20mg Belsomra that my MD gave me a free sample of. About an hour into the drug, I started feeling very dizzy and my head felt so heavy, and I immediately felt this strong urge to knock out and fall into a deep slumber, so I went to my bed and started falling asleep. However, I started experiencing major sleep paralysis - it felt like it lasted for a long time, and my body just couldn&#039;t move even though my mind was fully aware and conscious of what was happening. 

Later on during the night, I kept falling asleep and waking up sporadically. By this morning, I was beat and vowed never to take this again.""",0
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""Overall this medication has been absolutely wonderful.  Our 12 year old son was diagnosed at age 7 with ADHD. We did try another medicine, but it stopped working after about 2 years. We have been on the Focalin XR since.  Our son takes 25 mg, 2 times daily about 6 hours apart. It has helped a ton. He does have the appetite issue, but we are sustaining it, and when it wears off at nite, he eats great. The mornings are the worst part before the medicine kicks in.  Our son has improved so much in school and in his extra curricular activities.  He is a total joy when the medication is working. We do try and give him &quot;drug vacations&quot; on the weekends and during the summer which helps maintain his weight.""",1
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I had Nexplanon for 2 weeks. The first week was fine. The second week I lost my appetite, sex drive, 10 pounds, and experienced mood swings and sadness. I knew before getting it that it takes 3 months to adjust, but when I decided to get it, I didn&#039;t know how much it would affect my mood and I was not willing to make myself go through 3 months of these symptoms. I&#039;ve been depressed before and I felt like I was heading in that direction. I went to Planned Parenthood and had them take it out. I certainly was not on it long enough to give a detailed review of the product, but I was on it long enough to know that my body was unhappy with my decision to get it. I&#039;m happy I got it removed. I recommend trying it, but listen to your body.""",8
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I have had severe migraines &amp; chronic pain daily ever since I was attacked &amp; stabbed with a 9&quot; butcher knife 8 and a half years ago. It resulted in a myriad of chronic issues &amp; severe pain. I have been put on a variety of different pain medicines since I started seeing a pain specialist. Oxycontin &amp; Oxycocet (Percocet) did little to nothing to ease the pain. Demerol helped with the pain, but my tolerance grew too quickly. I&#039;ve been prescribed 8mg of Dilaudid to take as needed &amp; it&#039;s the first medicine to help me feel not completely useless because of my pain and to remain helpful. I&#039;m also on other medicines for other issues and it interacts fine and actually also helps when combined with my other medicines with those same issues which other medicines had not helped with in the past.

Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""Latuda has changed my life.  I&#039;ve been treated with everything under the sun since I was 20 years old.  Within days of taking the Latuda I felt like a normal person.  I don&#039;t know if I EVER felt so genuinely happy, light-hearted, motivated to make life changes.  It&#039;s like a miracle.  I don&#039;t experience any side effects.  I don&#039;t feel tremendously hungry either, as I have with other anti psychotics.  I only hope it continues to keep my bipolar at bay.

Belviq worked for me immediately to suppress my appetite.  I am counting my exact calories daily and sticking to a 1200-1300 calorie diet.  I have not felt deprived and Belviq is keeping my hunger at bay.  I have not experienced any noticeable side effects.  I go back to my doctor in a month for a weigh-in.  I will re-post my results.  So far so good.  So far I would definitely recommend this drug.""",3
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I took Lunesta only for a few days because it gave me unpleasant taste. It was really bad. Then I switched to Ambien. It was better than Lunesta, but there was a residual effect that the medicine made me irritable and anxious next morning. My doctor gave me Silenor. It is better than Ambien CR. I do not feel anxious or irritable next morning and I can sleep 8 hours. The only side effect, though very minor, is that it makes me sluggish a little. But, overall, Silenor is better than Ambien CR. """,0

My mood seems better, my skin and energy felt good but as soon as I added that 3rd pill things changed. Waves of nausea, my eyesight has been horrible, light effects my eyes differently and my vision has been unsteady which it adds to the nausea.

I took the first pill that night, went to bed and when I woke up ALL of my acne was gone!!13 years of horrible acne and over night it was gone! for 3 days I took it 2x a day like I was told, but I decided since it was working so well i only wanted to take it once a day considering doxy is a strong antibiotic and I didnt want my body to get such a strong dose for 2 weeks. As soon as I finsihed the acne came back, with a vengence. I&#039;m going to look into accutane""",4
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on Saxenda since January 11th and have lost 9lbs.

I have a complex medical history, but being lighter and able to do more with my body is the goal. Weight wise my goal for the first 6 months is to lose 56lbs. 

My side effects thus far have been TERRIBLE. Extreme nausea, acid reflux, severe fatigue - even some moderate to severe dizziness. I&#039;m not enjoying it much HOWEVER - it seems to improve 10 - 12 days after each dose increase.

Dosing: because of my side effects I&#039;ve needed to slow my dose progression. Every 2 weeks I increase by 0.6 mg.

Insurance: In Canada the Public Service health care plan covers this medication  *in some cases*. There needs to be a medical need aside from obesity. 

Good luck everyone.""",2
Aczone,Acne,"""I am a 45 year old female with hormonal cystic acne which I&#039;ve had for around 10 years. I&#039;ve tried various oral antibiotics, prescription topical creams, face washes, etc... When my dermatologist first put me on Aczone I thought it was a miracle cream. I would have given it 10 stars the first few months because the first 3 months were AWESOME. The next 6 months were okay. Over the last 3 months I have had a tube in the drawer but the over the counter acne creams work just as well now. It is expensive if you don&#039;t have insurance. It is worth a try but for me it isn&#039;t working like it did at first. I didn&#039;t notice any side effects other than dry skin.""",4
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""Only 2 days in and I have zero appetite. I am focusing on weight lifting rather than cardio for my exercise and I have to force myself to eat so I get enough protein in, otherwise I truly believe I wouldn&#039;t eat a single thing all day. And even then, I&#039;m extremely stuffed after just a few bites. I do get a bit jittery for an hour or two after taking my pill. I&#039;ve also experienced what I&#039;ll call &quot;pent up energy&quot;. I don&#039;t get energy like I want to run around cleaning the house, it&#039;s an energy like I want to go lift heavy weights. I would almost say it&#039;s an aggressive energy but in a violent or mean manner at all. I hope this continues to work as it has these first few days. If it does I&#039;ll reach my fat loss goal in no time""",2
Wellbutrin XL,ADHD,"""I was like one of those fluorescent bulbs flickering out..had ADHD and depression. When I was upped to the 300mg in week two the bulb was changed, light was on. Forget the light, I was solar powered. Sexual side effects nymphomaniac 1st 2 weeks. Healthy by week 3. Husband couldn&#039;t keep up. I woke up without an alarm went to bed slept great. I started working out. Then I got a rash. I was devastated. I wanted to explore the possibility of continuing while living on allergy medicines. I tried that for a few day but the good feelings were gone. My body refused to cooperate with my mind and emotions. Drug Companies please come up with another antidepressant NDRI I can take. Goodbye Wellbutrin, with you the honeymoon was grand. Going to try out Cymbalta.""",1
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the implant because it seemed logical choice for a fast paced lifestyle where you can&#039;t remember everything. So I switched to it, the insertion was a little painful but healed quickly. I had no serious effects except acne really bad the first few weeks. Then about a month in I started my period on it and had chest pain and numbness in my right arm so I got it removed. And learned I have nerve damage from it. Would I recommend this to someone else no, it still has some kinks to be worked out. But everyone is different I wish I never would have gotten it.""",8
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I was worried this would not work for me since I was not really that overweight (6&#039;2-206).  I began working out 5 times a week and was losing weight but only a very small amount and I was hitting a wall.  Once I began using Victoza and continuing my workout routine the weight just started shedding right off.  This was everything I always dreamed of.  You will lose some weight just by taking this but if you include it with working out wow! Also it does curve your appetite but I have noticed you can eat healthier things without feeling ill. It seems that high sugar and fats are the ones that I get turned off too which is just an added bonus. 1 month into it and I am now 186lbs so I have lost 20 pounds and feel and look great!""",2
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I guess I&#039;m in the group of people that had severe reaction to this medication. The doctor prescribed 100mg trazodone for my &quot;eyes wide open in bed throughout the night&quot; problem. I took caution for the first night and took half a pill or 50mg but after about half an hour my heart stared beating really fast and arrhythmic, my ears and forehead become really hot, etc. it took an hour, two glasses of cold water and trying to breath normally for it to pass. A horrible experience which I won&#039;t forget. Next day I went to my doc and yelled angrily that if I had taken full dose it could have killed me and his reaction was something like oops! seems like this med is not for you! 

Short version : my advice is to take a small dose at first ,if ok then increase """,0
Retin-A,Acne,"""Well I started using retin a cream .25 about a month and 3 weeks ago. I started by using every 3 day for one month and then using it every other day. My face has gotten red and my acne scars seem to be more noticeable but around my eyes are really white, so you can imagine how I look. Well I&#039;m not sure if this is part of the process, I&#039;m going to stick with it one more month and see what happens. I use cerave pm moisturizer after applying and yes I use a moisturizer with spf 50 during the day that is a cetaphil product. So I really hope this is just a phase I&#039;m going through, I&#039;ll update in a month.""",4
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve struggled with my weight for years, I am a total binge eater at night. My doctor first brought up Victoza and I was really hesitant to take it (the whole injection thing scared me), but honestly it&#039;s not bad at all! You just have to pinch your skin wherever you&#039;re administering the medication and you won&#039;t feel anything. The needle used is I think a 38g which is SUPER small. No bruising or anything around the site of injection. 

This is my second week on it, and I&#039;ve already lost 5lbs. I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects, I did get a little nauseous the first two days but it wasn&#039;t anything that was so horrible I couldn&#039;t continue. I don&#039;t have any problems binge eating, it&#039;s great! I hope to see more results in the next few weeks!""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had Implanon inserted in July &#039;12. It has been just about six months, and I am probably looking to have it removed. The insertion was fine- I thought it was painful but I didn&#039;t find it unbearable. At first, I was SO happy with not having my period. But since Thanksgiving - over a month and a half - I have been bleeding! It is light, but constant, sometimes brown, sometimes red. I have never had acne like I have experienced with Implanon as well. I would be able to deal with the acne if I wasn&#039;t bleeding for weeks. """,8
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""I loved this medication, but sadly after taking it for 2 weeks I had the worst menstrual pain in my life. So I re-tried it after that time of the month and the next menstrual cycle was the same, but this medicine made the panic attacks go away, I slept well, my appetite improved, and my mood lifted. The first week is the worst. On it you feel like a zombie but that goes away. I tried all the SSRI&#039;s and they made me SO sick...severe nausea, diarrhea, headaches, sweating, felt crazy, made my panic very severe. I wish so much that I could take Remeron it would have saved my life I am sure I felt great on it except the menstrual side effects and the doctor said I couldn&#039;t take it for that reason.""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on this med for 2 months, and I&#039;ve lost 22 pounds. Once you get over the hurdles like the jitters, headaches, and upset stomach..the med really is a dream. I have a binge eating disorder, and OCD. This has curbed that need to keep eating, and a lot of other problems related to the OCD. I&#039;m less obsessive which leads to less compulsions, and not spending all my hard earned money on take out, online shopping, and other forms of useles spending. 

I started out rather heavy, 353, and I honestly can say it&#039;s really amazing to not have that urge to eat all the time. It&#039;s amazing what you can focus on when food is not on your mind 24/7. It&#039;s nice being focused, and I can&#039;t wait to see where I&#039;m at in a year!

Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had acne since I was 12 and had tried several topical antibiotics but they never seemed to work. I went to the Dr and he prescribed me 100 mg doxycycline hyclate once a day and duac gel twice a day. The first few weeks it dried my face out but not TOO bad.. Just be sure to stay moisturized and drink lots of water other wise it&#039;ll be worse. After about a month I seen results here and there but I&#039;d still break out. 2nd month started to get a little better. I&#039;m now on my 3rd month (almost finished) and I honestly can&#039;t believe how much of a difference I see from when I first started taking it. All I have is a few scars but that&#039;s NOTHING. I&#039;m so excited!! I&#039;ve been waiting for this day forever :) I highly recommend it.""",4
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I wanted so badly for this medicine to work, but it has not controlled my hypomanic anxiety or insomnia at all. And it made my depersonalization, concentration, and irritability worse. And now as a side effect I&#039;m having short term memory issues.

The only reason that Latuda has a 2 instead of a 1 is because I haven&#039;t gained any weight or had any other typical antipsychotic side effects.""",6
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I have been taking oxycodone for almost a year now for severe back pain. Not only did they not work, but the side effects were terrible!  Really bad constipation and dry mouth so I had to get two other prescriptions for those. Back in June, I was admitted to the ER locally, and at first they gave me morphine after they figure it out that it was acute pancreatitis. Right before the ambulance came to take me down to the VA Hospital in Pittsburgh, they gave me dilaudid  in the IV and within 10 minutes the pain was pretty much gone. So they continued me on it while I was in the hospital and afterwards for my back pain. It&#039;s been the only thing that has helped with both. oxycodone and morphine have no real effect on my pain.""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had been experiencing probs with high blood pressure and melazma from the birth control patch. My doc advised me to use mirena. I am 30 and have 3 children, my doctor told me implanting the IUD would be uncomfortable but since I had kids it shouldn&#039;t be so bad. It was the most pain I have ever been in. Worse than my labor with all 3. They said it wouldn&#039;t last long, but I had to lie down in the office for 2 hours, until the office closed. The cramping continued for a couple days. I had stuck with it for about 6 months, but my face is breaking out like I am 15 (which I have never had a problem with) and I have had an awful discharge since I have had the IUD. I have had very very mild periods which is nice, but I plan on having it removed.""",8
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Started Saxenda nearly 3 weeks ago.NO change in hunger levels. I started at 123kg and am still there.I have no other symptoms ie cholestrol/hormones in range, blood pressure is always spot on.There are days where I&#039;m not hungry but I cannot put this down to the drug and then most days where the hunger is ridiculous.I rang my GP and told her this.She said to keep going. She asked if Saxenda have been in touch with me - answer no even though I have registered -there is supposed to be support network. Will keep going until reach the full dose but if nothing happens will ditch it but will call my GP to let her know what I am doing.Good luck to everyone finds this drug works for you.""",2
Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""First birth control I&#039;ve used and I LOVE it. Been using it for 6 months now. I remember the first 2 patches I ever put on made me a bit nauseous, but now I put it on with no complaints whatsoever. When the patch needs to be taken off for my period, I typically get my period after 24hours. Although not recommended, it does work if you have unprotected sex so it&#039;s nice to have that safety in the back of your mind. The only complaint I could possibly have about it is the price of the patch per month. Other than that I&#039;ve had no side effects and am very happy about it!""",8
Citalopram,Depression,"""This seems to be working well for me. I&#039;ve been on it for three months now, at 10mg a day. As far as my depression goes, the fog has lifted, I find myself being able to keep up with my life again, things that I used to let like up because I was to tired aren&#039;t an issue any more. I&#039;ve had energy for the first time in years and it&#039;s amazing! As far as treating my OCD, this medication at this dosage is not helping with repetitive thoughts or anxiety unfortunately. Hopefully increasing the dose will help!""",5
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed Atarax taking 25mg up to 3x daily or as needed. The first few days it made me groggy and want to sleep and experience very vivid dreams and nightmares. After a few days the grogginess went away and it actually helped me function while having high anxiety and helped to calm me. I still experience nightmares more often than I&#039;d like to but I&#039;d rather be functioning daily so I keep taking it""",7
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I am 24 and for years I have struggled with my weight. It wasn&#039;t super serious until I got in a relationship- I gained nearly 40kg in under a year. At my heaviest I was 116kg. I see a personal trainer, go to Zumba, and I thought I was eating well- nothing helped me shed the weight. I got tested for thyroid issues and PCOS- neither explained my inability to shed the Kgs.

I started this drug about 17 days ago. My starting weight was 106.7kg- I now weigh 100.4kg. It has completely changed how I view food, what I crave, and made me realise that whilst the foods I was previously eating were good foods, I was eating far too much because my body had forgotten how to recognise true hunger. I am so excited- it is so worth the money. 10/10!!!""",2
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""Wellbutrin has significantly improved my overall concentration above all else. For the first time in many years, I have been able to actually sit down and read contently without my mind wondering. I wish I had this medication before I graduated from university, my grades would probably have been much better. I take this in combination with Cipralex. I have had no side effects with this medication.""",5
Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on this medication for about 8 months now.  I started at a low dose 200mg a day and now I&#039;m on 600 mg.  300mg in the morning and at night.  I find that it makes me sleepy but what doesn&#039;t.  I am not so sleepy that I cannot function just sleepy when I know I has a good nights sleep.  Anyway,  I am moody and my moods swing from very happy to super mad like many people with bipolar.  This helps we control that.  I does nothing for depression but it&#039;s not meant to.  The side effects are very mild.""",6

Initial day 9 crash as autoreceptors sense too much serotonin and move to regulate levels so they drop making you feel like the world is coming to an end once they desensitize things improve.

Diclofenac,Pain,"""Had bursitis in the shoulder and haven&#039;t had the time to go for a cortisone shot.  Suffered through 2 weeks waiting for it to subside (doctor&#039;s on vacation) but doesn&#039;t seem to get better. Pharmacist gave me some of this, had the wife rub it on. I thought that I must be going out of my mind, because it felt better WITHIN SECONDS. I&#039;d say 90% of the pain is gone. This is the best. I&#039;ll use it a week, and then if it still hurts, I&#039;ll go to the doctor.  Worth every penny.""",9
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Moved and my new doctor took me off Paxil and put me on Escitalopram.  Works better than Paxil with no side effects.  I function like a normal person.  I get little anxiety attacks out of nowhere, but if I sit down and still my thoughts, the butterflies go away.  My doctor gave me a script for klonipin for the attacks, it works well, but I only take if it gets bad.  Can&#039;t drive taking klonpin, feel a little too mellow.""",7
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I am 5&#039;4 and need to lose about 30lbs.  I started Belviq about two weeks ago.  I have had no side effects and the results of reducing my hunger have been great.  The first week I lost nearly nothing but hopped on the scale this morning and I was nearly 5lbs down.  I do think it is somewhat of a mind game so you must pay attention to your diet.  For me the curbing the appetite was big since my problem with eating was never what I ate but more about how much I ate.  I am tracking my diet on an app and it seems to be motivating to continue....My concerns are when I get off, will I just gain it all back?""",3
Venlafaxine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I may have had good experiences with Effexor the first six months or so. But, without a mood stabilizer, I soon went into a hypomanic stage. At times, on the medicine, I went into an full-blown manic phases. Once again, without a mood stabilizer.

The most challenging part about this medicine, (or the generic venlafaxine which I took) is quitting it. Now, I am a poster child for doing it wrong, no doubt.

That is, it is extremely challenging to quit this medicine going Cold Turkey. You will read online where people will tell you point blank, &quot;Do not quit this medicine cold turkey.&quot; Listen to them.

It took at least five months to feel like this medicine was totally out of my system.""",6
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I took the first pill yesterday around 8 am and it worked right away.  By 4pm my stomach was a bit queasy so I ate some dinner.  By 6 pm I was feeling sick to my stomach with pain and nausea.  I went to the bathroom a couple of times and was still very nauseated.  By 2am I was throwing up.  I then took some anti nausea meds and finally fell asleep by 4am.  I woke up around 8:30am no longer nauseated but felt like I got hit by a freight train.  I&#039;ve been on the couch all day taking mini naps.  It is now 7pm and I&#039;m finally starting to feel better.
I called the pharmacy to see if I could get a refund but they said no.  I can see how the meds work but not at the physical cost of being deathly ill.  I hope this works for someone else.""",3
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""23 male, been taking buspar for 3 years now for anxiety/ocd with intrusive thoughts. I originally started with 10mg 2x a day. Took about 2-3 weeks to take effect, after that I really noticed a difference in my anxiety and intrusive thoughts. It really helped me get through the day and feel normal. I occasionally still had panic attacks that would eventually pass with drinking a bunch of water and sometimes taking an extra &quot;helper&quot; dose. Recently switched to 3x a day still at 10mg since the med doesn&#039;t seem to last as long as it used to. Still occasionally take a &quot;helper&quot; dose to fall asleep. Side affects were/still are antsy legs, dizziness, drowsiness, and extreme appetite all for only about 30 min. Overall better than anti-depressants.""",7
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 18, and I&#039;ve had it for about a week now. The insertion was fine -- they had to do it without the cervix dilation medication, however, because they forgot to tell me to get it, and as a result i think it was a little more painful than usual. I took deep breaths and it was over in 5 seconds after some pretty intense contractions. After laying down for 20 minutes, I was fine to walk around. I highly reccommend just taking the day off. Cramps got pretty bad and i slept all day when i got home. Since then, I haven&#039;t noted any physical or emotional side effects aside from the constant light bleeding. There are occasional cramps, but they never last for longer than five minutes and occur maybe 3 times a day, so yeah, that&#039;s totally manageable""",8
Effexor XR,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Effexor-XR for around 6 months now.  My dose is up to 300 mg, and it will probably increase to 375 mg next visit.  I was in an extremely deep depression and was initially prescribed prozac.  That was a mistake for me.  Affter a 2 week washout I was switched to a low dose of efexor, and it was gradually increased.  It is helping with the depression.  I have feelings again, and I can talk to people and meet their eyes.  It&#039;s not so good for the generalised anxiety.  Side effects at the start were lack of appetite and insomnia.  Only the insomnia remains, and has got worse as the dose has increased.""",5
Voltaren Gel,Pain,"""Long story kinda short! My knee swelled up where I couldn&#039;t even bend it. My mom gave me a tube of her gel. It worked right away when I applied it. Great stuff. Here&#039;s the best part though. I have a bulge in my lower back. I have meloxacam but I don&#039;t take it regularly because I feel that it don&#039;t help any. So one day my back is as hurting really bad so I decided to apply the gel. Glad I did because wow! It works amazing! They should most definitely test it on the back. I know surgery will be the only thing for permanent relief but I&#039;m only 31 and one can&#039;t afford it and two it&#039;s not guarantee it would work and  could make my problem worse. Next time I go to my doctor I will be asking for my own prescription.""",9
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I am a 16 year old girl who has suffered with extreme anxiety and severe depression since I was 9. The reason why I was so depressed was mainly because I was mildly depressed so they put me on cymbalta and I suffered from the &quot;black box warning&quot; in which adolescents and teens can experience suicidal thoughts and actions. that really messed me up. I&#039;d have panic attacks where I was convinced I wanted to, and I&#039;d puke and shake and stuff. it still happens but when it does my parents give me 0.25mg (I&#039;m very very lightweight so they don&#039;t want a lot in my system) and it seems I work alright. I&#039;d like to take it everyday but my parents are so hesitant to give it to me.""",7
Gabapentin,Pain,"""After the timing of using this medication is adjusted correctly (activation time for myself takes 2 hours for peak performance), it has helped allow me to sleep, and to take away the pain caused by nerve damage. Though it was not meant for it, it has also helped with chronic back pain, and pain in my hands. A fairly effective drug. Please understand that my use of this drug is not related to seizures, and so I cannot comment on it&#039;s effectiveness in that particular field.""",9
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""Thank God for this medication! After a few major life changes I recently went through I developed an anxiety disorder on top of frequent panic attacks. After trying a few medicines my PCP put me on a Xanax regimen. BAD IDEA! Within 2 1/2 months I was up to 4-5mg/day! I got sick of it and went to a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner. After being appalled that I was prescribed that much Xanax she put me on a Gabapentin regimen. 100mg 3x&#039;s a day for one week, then 200mg 3x&#039;s a day for my second week. Then a follow up. I just started my second week and I&#039;m already taking less than half of the Xanax I was needing. She said within a month I&#039;ll be off the Xanax. I feel great all day. I don&#039;t even feel like I need the Xanax.""",7
Amnesteem,Acne,"""I have been struggling with acne since I graduated high school. It got REALLY BAD. Around that time (high school) is when I first took isotretinoin. I took it for about 3 months and it worked wonders for me. However 8 years later the bad acne has reappeared. I take Amnesteem now. I&#039;m in my second week and its making it worse. I don&#039;t remember this medicine doing this the first time. The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced was dry lips, dry skin and dry eyes so far. I hope this gets better for me.

Nucynta,Pain,"""I am a register nurse working 12 hour shifts.  tugging pulling.  I fell back in 1998 and damaged both of my knee&#039;s severely.  I have taken many different medications to control my chronic pain.  I have been taking nucynta 75mg every 6 hours since summer 2015.  Not all of my pain is gone, but I can tolerate more activity.  My life has improved greatly.   It is great that I do not have to burn up my liver with Tylenol.  Like all medications; it is not for everybody.  It works with my body chemistry.   My pain levels are low enough where I can sleep.""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I am 37 years old and was finally diagnosed with Adult ADHD almost 2 years ago so I was put on 20 mg Adderal XR and it worked great. But I did start to notice that I would get pretty irritable on it mostly when it was wearing off. So I wanted to try a different medication to see if there was one I wasn&#039;t so grumpy on. So I started Metadate CD and I was not irritable on that one at all :) But it seemed to wear off within 4 hours and made me soo tired. So now I am on Aptensio and it has been pretty good so far I have only been on it for about a week and it really does last a long time and I am able to stay focused. I don&#039;t feel a crash like Adderal. I would just recommend taking it early in the morning so it can wear off before you go to bed.""",1
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve only had Implanon for 6 months. They say anything can happen so they can&#039;t tell you much about your period. But, in my experience I&#039;ve had no period so far and no cramps or PMS symptoms. 

I don&#039;t believe the Implanon made me gain weight. I was gradually gaining my Freshman 25 in college from September-May and I got the Implanon in January. It didn&#039;t make me gain weight abnormally. I just continued my weight gain from eating such unhealthy food at school. Since then, I&#039;ve lost 17 pounds and I don&#039;t believe the Implanon has slowed down any of the weight loss.

Unfortunately, reviews are not going to help you because Implanon is strictly person to person, when it comes to side effects. In my case, I love Implanon!""",8
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Initially I started on citalopram 20 mg once a day. It was great for anxiety and my depression but I had no sex drive at all. My doctor changed me to Effexor 75 mg once a day for long term and was taking lorazepam 1mg as needed. My anxiety was not controlled. I had to take my lorazepam up to 3 times a day. Spoke to my doctor and I stayed on the Effexor but he switched me over to clonazepam 1 mg twice daily as needed. Lorazepam has a short life but clonazepam stays in your system way longer. Ever since I started on the clonazepam I feel so much better. There are days I only take 1mg at night and that&#039;s all I need.""",7
Risperdal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking this medication for about a year.  I started off with 0.5 mg.  I was still having some evening anxiety so I asked to be moved to 1 mg dosage.  I still had occasional anxiety in the evenings, so I asked to be moved to 1-2 mg dosage.  I find that moving up to a 2 mg dosage causes me some drowsy issues and I am currently tweaking it to where I need it. My anxiety is like nothing I have ever seen or heard anyone experience.  I know there are other people out there that have the same issues.  I think it helps stabilize my highs and lows.  I am more a bipolar type 2 person, which means my depressions are slight and my hypo-mania is somewhat great because I feel I can take on the world.""",6
Belviq,Obesity,"""Since I started taking this medicine I have lost 11 inches total and 15lbs. I noticed since starting this I have been able to keep up on daily work along w workouts. When I think I wanted something to eat my mind will think about it but then quickly change to do something else. I love this med and I love that I&#039;m getting in shape because of it. I even sleep better at night now. I no longer take blood pressure med and only half of anxiety/depression med. Even with Multiple Sclerosis I&#039;m doing great!!!!""",2
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on latuda for almost a year now. At first it was great it really made my moods stable. But now I have awful restless legs at night. It also has increased my appetite I&#039;m hungry all the time I&#039;ve gained 10 pounds on it even though it&#039;s supposed to be weight neutral. I&#039;m constantly tired have no motivation. It made my acne much worse. I&#039;m going to try something else.""",6
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""This medication worked for my anxiety but made me a complete zombie. I would forget things I was doing and just had a drowsy I don&#039;t care attitude. It got rid of my anxiety but interrupted my daily work routine because I couldn&#039;t think to function. 

I would only recommend if you are having extreme jump out of your skin anxiety, otherwise try to do things naturally. I started taking vitamins and working out regularly and my anxiety has gone down at least 60%.""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I was prescribed Doxycycline the summer. I had moderate to severe acne and within a month my face had almost cleared all up. It was great. I continued taking the pill for a year and a half but as I continued I realized my acne was slowly coming back even with the pill. My face had become resistant to doxycycline so I now switched to another antibiotic. My only advice to you, try it if you want to but as many others have said it&#039;s only a temporary solution.""",4
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had my Skyla inserted today and had a GREAT experience!! I am a virgin and no kids...seriously had zero pain having this put in. I did insert a cytotec vaginally before my appointment, and I took 800mg of ibuprofen 45 minutes before. I think the key is making sure you have a doctor you trust insert it, I work with my doctor and I have seen her insert many IUDs and she always does a fantastic job so that&#039;s why I chose her and I&#039;m so glad I did. Right now (3 hours after insertion) I&#039;m lying on the couch with a heating pad and minor cramping. Just feels like I&#039;m about to start my period. I can&#039;t wait to see how this does for me.""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had this for about a year and a half and have loved it so far. My periods have completely stopped which for some is a worry but I find it rather convenient. The process of putting it is wasn&#039;t too bad but there was a little swelling and bruising at the site for a few days which is to be expected. Prior to getting Implanon I was switching around birth control pills trying to find something that would regulate my periods and work well for me, so this was a great change, I recommend everyone to talk to their doctors if they are looking for a new alternative. I have pretty good insurance so what would&#039;ve cost me more than $700 got reduced to only $30 including the insertion procedure, also alleviates the monthly cost.""",8
Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am currently on 3200 MG a day (was on 2400 a day, but after 5 years started to develop a tolerance).  I have been put on it for my bipolar then taken off of it then put back on it for an injury to my neck.  After several nightmare drug trials including Geodon, Tegretol, Lithium, Seroquel, and Zyprexa and more... I will never again stray from this medication.  The ones in the list that did help caused horrific side effects mostly being a feeling like restless leg syndrome (except with Seroquel it was all over my body), and with Lithium I have never wanted to commit suicide as strongly as I did on the two times I attempted that medication.  Neurontin makes me calmer, sometimes giggly I admit, and sometimes zoned out but this is rare.""",6
Strattera,ADHD,"""My son is 15 now and we have struggled for years with his ADHD. He has now been on Strattera for 2 years and has gone from straight D&#039;s in maths to A in achievement he can concentrate more retain information and does not lose it as he uses to. I have seen no side effects at all. At one point he went off it, lasted 5 days then chose to go back on it as he could tell that it helped his behaviour and way of dealing with things. I have only good things to say about Strattera.""",1
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Latuda for over two years. I feel a lot better,  though I am somewhat apathetic and don&#039;t want to bathe, cook, or clean house. I have to eat a large meal to stave off the nausea. When I have nausea,  I eat saltine crackers until I no longer feel sick. Other types of crackers work too. I take benztropine to prevent unconscious chewing. It doesn&#039;t stop the fidgeting and restlessness that I feel.""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on Contrave for about 4 months and I have also been on a strict diet as well. It hasn&#039;t helped me at all. I haven&#039;t lost any weight at all. I had severe headaches during the initial phases of increasing dosages and after stabilized dosages I haven&#039;t seen any difference at all. I read that if it didn&#039;t show any difference within the first couple of months then it was most likely not effective for you. Considering another option. One positive thing though is the free scale from the scale down program, however the constant hounding and text messages gets old very quickly.""",2
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m a 54 yo woman, 5&#039; 4&quot;. 155lbs at start. I am in awe. Been on Belviq for 11 days. First time ever that I feel completely confident that I won&#039;t binge or overeat. I have NO side effects, eating 3 meals a day, no desire to over eat....feel full after small meal.  Its a complete miracle for me so far.  I could so this forever! Not sure how it is working but I love it!  Trust that I can even eat a forbidden food in small amount. Its the BEST! """,3
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Changed my life totally and completely. I used to be on a emotional roller coaster...up and down, over and over again. This medicine just brings me to a mellow state. I let nothing get to me anymore. I never get hostile, and that was my norm. I actually think this medicine saved my life because I was so tired of being emotional and angry!  This was my last resort. I tried everything else that the doctor wanted me to try and none of that phased me. I recommend this to anyone with bipolar. """,6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I was taking Belsomra (20 mg) for almost a year, and initially it worked great. I was falling asleep in a natural way without feeling I had taken a sleeping pill. After three or four months things started to change. I started feeling a bit depressed with some anxiety. What was really strange is that I would get lots of work related anxiety -- things started bugging me at work that normally would not. It&#039;s like small things at work bugged me far more than usual. I could not understand what changed. In addition, I was accumulating some depression and everything took more energy to do. Finally, I started suspecting Belsomra was the cause, so as soon as I stopped, all these symptoms simply evaporated! OMG, I finally can feel the sunshine!""",0
Lidoderm,Pain,"""Like the many others that have written responses, I have been using Lidoderm patches for many years.  I began with the Brand Name and then CVS switched to the generic by ENDO.  If you can find this generic it works just like the original.  But recently they switched to the newly developed generic by Mylan.  Do not waste your money. They are highly ineffective.  Difficult to separate from the plastic and very stiff un-maleable.  Once applied the stiffness causes them to lift up, beginning with the corners and pretty soon the whole patch releases.  Obviously the adhesive doesn&#039;t work either.  I can&#039;t get them to stay on long enough to see if they even work - no where the recommended 12 hours which I have had no problem with on others!""",9
Tenuate Dospan,Obesity,"""Favorable experience. I was too fat and my doctor prescribed it: Tenuate 75mg. Lost a lot of weight rather quickly probably due to the fact I wasn&#039;t hungry at all while taking Tenuate 75mg. As a truck driver the added bonus of staying awake and alert helped. No bad side effects &amp; I was able to stop taking them without any withdrawal problems. I took only one each night before starting work. It was great. Ask your doctor first about a prescription.""",2
Meperidine,Pain,"""For those of you having trouble finding Demerol or any other hard to find analgesics, or any medication for that matter, forget big chains. Try going to the closest hospital pharmacy. They tend to carry things that other pharmacies do not. They also are able to more order things much easier because as a hospital, they must have these things available for people with allergies, etc. I wish the FDA/DEA would realize how harmful NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) can be, and that everyone is different. What works for one may have horrible side effects for another. When taken responsibly narcotic analgesics are less harmful to the body, and this is a subject that i have researched extensively. For now, try bringing ur scrip to the hospital pharmacy!""",9
Tretinoin,Acne,"""10 MONTH RETIN-A USER :
In the begining of summer 2013 I had the worst break out ever! My forehead was full of pimples. I couldn&#039;t stand it anymore so I went to go see my doctor and he prescribed me Retin-A. It says to apply everyday over night after washing your face. So I applied it every night and the first three weeks my acne was okay by the second month I had another mild breakout but by the third month it began to calm down again. By the fourth the skin around my nose started to peel and it was very itchy. Because of this I applied alchol free/ fragrance free lotion and my skin got better. By the 6th month my acne was under control! I only had a couple of pimples here &amp; there. But the product works wonders! It just takes patience!""",4
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I started taking lexapro 2 years ago. I have always had bad nerves , but when my daughter graduated high school, I was suffering from the &quot;empty nest syndrome&quot;. Lexapro really helped me alot and the only fall back for me was my weight gain. I went from size 10 to 16 . I am going off from the medicine now and I think that I will do okay and if I ever have to go back on something it would be this. Good Luck!""",7
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I have been taking a 50mg dose twice a day for 2 weeks and have lost about 13 lbs. I struggle with remembering to take the medicine in the mornings and those are the days I tend to eat more, usually fast food. But when I do remember to take them I eat so much less and have less cravings. They make me thirsty so I drink more water, no complaints though. And I have quit bedtime snacking on unhealthy foods or portions.And my energy and mood levels are way up, making things like waking up and the morning, going to work, or just working out more enjoyable and less draining. My goal is to lose 60 pounds and with this medicine I know I can make it there.""",2
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I had nexplannon for two years. I kept thinking things will get better, obviously I have the patience of a saint! I got it removed today and started nuva ring. My past two years...I did not get pregnant nor did I have to remember to take a pill (the only two reasons I gave it 2 stars). I bled almost the entire time, I never wanted to have sex, even when I wasn&#039;t bleeding. I had brown discharge when I wasn&#039;t bleeding and I got acne really bad! I was moody or so I was told anyway. But on a plus side I also didn&#039;t gain excessive weight. I personally would not recommend this for birth control. I&#039;m now on the hunt for the right one for me, everybody&#039;s different.""",8
Escitalopram,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been severely bipolar since I can remember. My emotions controlled me instead of the other way around my whole life. It&#039;s tough to convey my struggles in a short quip. I am on 20mg of Lexapro and for the first time in my life (34 yrs) I feel normal. I take it before bed with Unisom. My life has changed drastically in one month. I went from drinking and drugs 2-4 times a week to waking up at 7 and keeping a schedule. I notice and feel a huge difference in my thoughts, not racing. I noticed that symptom gone immediately. Mood swings, gone. Depression, still shows itself but more moments of peace and clarity. I am a happy gal.""",6
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Avoid this if you can. I had my son In April and lost all of my baby weight and then some within the first month postpartum. At my 6 week ppd appt I decided to get the implant due to ease and effectiveness. Insertion easy and I was really looking forward to getting intimate again with my husband. Unfortunately though, two weeks later and my sex drive was gone, I was having anger outbursts daily and I fell in a deep depression. I began getting acne and gained 20 lbs rapidly. I realized that it had to be my bc so I had it removed. two weeks later and I can safely say that my sanity, relationship and body are all finally healing. Sex drive is rockin, I can smile, my energy is back and I&#039;ve lost 6lbs!!""",8
Aczone,Acne,"""Before I was prescribed Aczone, I looked on this site for reviews. I&#039;ve been on it for about 9 weeks now and, while I&#039;ve never written a review of a drug, this one warrants it. 
In my early 20&#039;s, I started breaking out worse than I ever did as a teenager. I tried OTC everything, which did nothing, and even shelled out for Proactiv which only seemed to inflame it. When finally I went to the derm she told me that adult onset acne is common and that Aczone+antibiotic would kick it. The antibiotic (minocycline) was awful and after vomiting for 2 days I went off it. Aczone on its own, however, has been a true lifesaver. My painful, deep, cystic acne is gone. Only rare whiteheads now. Truly life changing. I wish I could post before/after pix.""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I took Accutane back in 2002, at that time I had been struggling with juvenile acne to severe cystic acne for a long time (11 years old). I was 28 when I started taking this. It changed my life, no more heavy makeup, no more hiding my face, no more painful breakouts.
I had no side effects, nor do I have any side effects now. My acne never came back 9 years later. Some people do not have side effects to this medication and if monitored correctly it is safe and it can change your life. """,4
Contrave,Obesity,"""Hello, I started taking Contrave April 18,2017 The only side effects I experience was a nausea, a headace nothing major.  I am down 4lbs which I am very excited about. For the nausea I take motion sickness. that helps out, I crew gum to offset it. I eat less. I work out three times a day. One thing I  notice this medicine changes the way things taste. as for  drinking  fluids. it makes drinks taste flat. which is fine with me. I start my 2 pills a day tomorrow. I will keep everybody updated on my progress. After reading all the reviews I was very discourage about starting Contrave. I am so glad I am giving it a try. I keep jolly ranchers in my purse. my mouth gets really dry. I pray this Medicine works out for everybody.""",2

Triazolam,Insomnia,"""I probably hold the record for the longest regular use of this drug!   Started taking Halcion .5 mg in 1982 (the year it came on the market, I think) and have taken it nearly every night for the past 33 years.  In all that time, I have missed maybe 20-30 nights total.   It is effective, staying in the bloodstream just six hours so you don&#039;t wake up groggy.   It works fast and helps me GET to sleep, which is my main problem.   I occasionally try going without it, but almost always get up around 1 a.m. if I haven&#039;t fallen asleep and take it.   After a number of years (maybe 8-10) the .5 mg strength was no longer available so I have taken .25 since then.  Frustrated that insurance will not cover it as it&#039;s been a great drug for me.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My son is currently 19 and was diagnosed with ADD when he was 8. He has been on many different medications with Adderall XR being the most recent. When he was in 10th grade the panic and anxiety attacks became so severe that we had to take him off Adderall. He has been taking Vyvanse (70mg)for about 2 years and really likes this medication. He does take himself off in summer for a break. Only side effect we&#039;ve noticed is high blood pressure which we keep a close eye on. He likes this medicine, the best and really has helped with focus.""",1
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""Im 18, and I&#039;ve never been on medications before... i have performance- and social anxiety. So when i went to my doctors and asked for something to help me survive my everyday life, he recommended Atarax. But i have been taking them for 2 weeks now with no effect what so ever... granted, they are only 10 mg and small as a breadcrumb, but i was at least expecting some effect from it. The only thing i felt was nausea and dizziness.... must say im quite disappointed """,7
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on fluoxetine for 8 years plus for depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder.  I thought I can do without it so I stopped several times in my 8 years and I can tell you that was a mistake.  I have severe depression and my anxiety goes through the roof and death would be a welcoming concept.  But I know I can&#039;t live without the medicines. It makes me think categorize my thoughts and I think more logically without compromise.""",5
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I started taking Buspar about a year ago for anxiety/panic attacks. I&#039;ve taken benzodiazepines in the past but having an addictive personality, I had to stop those. Buspar saved my life. I have no fear, paranoia, or low self esteem anymore. I used to feel like the world was out to get me and that I was being judged by everyone no matter where I went. I used to have the most crippling social anxiety too, I&#039;d avoid social situations because the anxiety was so bad. Luckily Buspar erased all of that for me. Anxiety still creeps up here and then but it is absolutely nowhere close to being as bad as it was before. No side effects. I love it and will take it for a long time. At first I did get headaches but they went away a couple days later. Love it.""",7
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""Abilify has enabled me to control some of my anxiousness and reactions due to being anxious better than I had been able to before.  I no longer want to smack someone who I feel is doing me wrong - I am able to control those impulses so much better than before, it is not even funny.  I think on a day to day basis, I am much more even keeled than I was before I started taking the medication.  Keep in mind that I take it with an antidepressant (Lexapro) because I understand that Abilify provides an assist to the Lexapro in controlling my overwhelming depression symptoms.  Depression and anger are now being controlled more effectively.""",6
Zoloft,Depression,"""I started Zoloft before my 3rd child was born. I&#039;ve had depression throughout my life and a major breakdown after my 1st child&#039;s birth. Noticed an improvement within days, and husband noticed huge diff. Dry mouth and increased appetite has cycled through the years on occasion. But the big side effect for me was insomnia. I thought it was my little one getting me up every 2 hours, but realized that taking the medicine at night was the cause. Switching to morning dose made such a difference. I do notice I don&#039;t sleep well if I take it after noon or 1pm. Some family members had tried it with no success. Give dosage and timing a chance. It has literally saved my life. I still feel emotional at times, but can cope with issues and heaviness in life has eased.""",5
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I was diagnosed with anxiety after having several bouts of severe anxiety and many lesser episodes. On two occasions I went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. My Dr. prescribed Lexapro. I don&#039;t recall any of the issues other describe and after two weeks or so, I was feeling much better and only sufferred from a few smaller episodes. I have noticed that heavy drinking is a disaster while on this med and results in me feeling ill and panic. I have had no other side effects. I did run out for nearly a week once and did feel some negative feelings coming on. I do not plan to run out ever again. I have taken 10 mg since the start three years ago. Avoid heavy drinking!""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""Went on Apprillon (Oracea) for 3 months, had great results. I stopped taking them because I learned that I should be on birth control while taking them as the medication has been linked to birth defects. I&#039;m not sexually active but it threw me off a bit, I don&#039;t like taking meds to begin with but I couldn&#039;t shake the idea that they could have that much of a negative effect. However, after months of not using it I&#039;m thinking of taking it again, since my skin has returned to its previous state. I had no side effects, and it was covered under free health care/insurance. 
All in all, 10 out of 10, would take again, would recommend.""",4
Tramadol,Pain,"""ZALDIAR- 37.5 mg tramadol/ 325mg paracetamol -tablets were prescribed to me every 4-6 hours for chronic pain following a severe leg infection and ulceration that wouldn&#039;t heal. I tried other over the counter pills including paracetamol, but couldn&#039;t sleep at night or concentrate on anything with the pain. ZALDIAR has been great - provided you don&#039;t forget to take it. If you do the pain comes back very quickly. Side effects so far - very dry, horrible tasting mouth, loss of appetite (a good thing) and feel a little confused at times and forgetful (maybe that&#039;s just age) and a little nausea. Feel so much better now pain is under control - thanks to those who invented tramadol.""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 17 and have been taking this for about a month now for ADHD. I started at small doses of Ritalin (10 mg) and then moved to 20 mg. My doctor thought it would be easier to just put me on Concerta since it&#039;s 18 mg a pill. I then took 36 mg of Concerta which didn&#039;t work out. I got major irritability and started feeling depressed. Even my focus was off. I went back down to 18 mg and it&#039;s working much better. No irritability, depression feeling. Make sure you&#039;re on the right dose for your body, too much can do more harm and too little may not do any thing.""",1
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Trileptal 600mg TID
Numerous others
Trileptal seems to be the topic at hand.
I was on Trileptal years ago and then went off my meds altogether for a few years. Upon restarting my psych meds my prescribers tried me on several meds all the while I kept mentioning that trileptal had helped me immensely in the past. Finally, out of frustration if I had to guess, I was put back on Trileptal. The climb back up the ladder to find my dose has been long and unpleasant, but I have found a place finally where my thoughts have slowed enough to think straight, and my manic highs have been brought down to a more manageable base level.""",6
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Seroquel For a while now, A side from being extremely hungry when I wake up, groggy, and the weight gain. It is a really good sleep aid. I am currently on 200mg. Not only am I less stressed and anxious but it slows me down to a point where I can actually think clearly rather than having racing thoughts and it tones down the late night activity greatly. I still work out and am very active but it is a lot less extreme thanks to Seroquel.""",0
Doxycycline,Acne,"""It started to clear up my acne after a few months of taking it, but the side effects were awful. I felt nauseous instantly afterwards and then was also sometimes sick, I couldn&#039;t sit or lie down for at least an hour afterwards and if I did I was guaranteed to be sick. I also had to make sure that I ate beforehand and didn&#039;t take the medication on an empty stomach because that would also cause sickness. The nausea was the worst part because I had to sit for half an hour feeling sick before I actually was which made it even worse. I eventually stopped taking it after about a year because my acne had completely cleared up, but then 6 months later it came back...only a temporary fix for me and the effects of it almost make it pointless""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""The first 2 weeks were rough. I was sick to my stomach, dizzy and tired. My doctor switched me to separate prescriptions of Wellbutrin and Naltrexone (the same drugs in Contrave) and I took one in the morning and one at bedtime. It got rid of the side effects. I&#039;ve lost 20lbs in the last 2 months. The medication doesn&#039;t suppress my appetite but now I can feel when I&#039;m full and I&#039;m able to walk away with food still on the plate. It doesn&#039;t miraculously take away the cravings, but now I feel okay saying no or having a couple of bites and being done. Before starting the medication I could eat a meal and an entire dessert by myself but now I eat maybe half as much. If Contrave made you sick it&#039;s worth asking your doc about separating it.""",2
Opana ER,Pain,"""I have been in terrible lower back pain for over 2 years. After numerous MRI&#039;s and other tests and alot of different doctors, nothing showed up that should be causing that much pain. They did find a problem in my L1 disc but nothing major. I have a very high tolerence for pain and could barely function. All the different doctors put me on Vicodin 10/325 but it only worked for an hour. The doctors treated me as if I was a drug addict even my pain management doctor. After I took a so called routine drug test, my very next visit after she saw I passed my drug test she put me on Opana ER 20mg. Instantly my back pain was 90% gone. I don&#039;t feel high, just pain free. I forgot what that felt like. My pain level went from a 10 to a 3 instantly.""",9
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Day 1 on Contrave, I feel dizzy, nauseous, and tired. My heart is beating rapidly, and I am wishing I hadn&#039;t started this today. I don&#039;t think I can push through theses side effects that are supposed to subside. I had been taking Phentermine for the last few months, with great success. My doctor said I can&#039;t stay on the phentermine long term, so we switched to Contrave. Not sure what to do from here about the side effects being so severe.""",3
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was prescribed 200-700mg for bipolar with psychotic features. At 200-400mg I slept well and woke up happy and felt content. Some symptoms remained, thus the increase to 700mg. At that level I had nightly blackouts where I would write belligerent texts to loved ones at night, and have no memory of it. I was horrified to learn of it later. I&#039;ve tried Geodon and Zyprexa with bad results like drooling somnolence and tachycardia. Next doctor visit I will ask to be put on 300 Seroquel. I had good results at that level, and wish to return to that. Looking forward to it. I&#039;m not on any anti-psychotic currently and I feel anxious.""",6
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I started taking spironolactone over a year and a half ago for moderate-severe acne that had been giving me awful self esteem, I was afraid to go out, and I was so depressed I was not myself anymore. Spironolactone has given me back my life. I didn&#039;t think it would ever be possible for me to feel pretty without makeup, but I&#039;m starting to. I did have a TERRIBLE breakout about a month after starting spironolactone that almost pushed me over the edge; it was miserable. But it cleared, and has continued to do so. It took at least 3  months to see the results I hoped for, but it has just gotten better and better. I&#039;m just hoping this is a good solution for me long-term; I want kids someday and I know I will have to stop this med before pregnancy.""",4
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on 1800 mg of lithium, 400 mg of lamictal for 10 years now.  I was diagnosed bipolar 1 with anxiety more than 20 years ago.  Recently, I felt I was starting to go all over the place and I knew it was time to talk with my shrink.  He put me on  120 mg at night with .5 xanax while continuing my other 2 meds.  The first night I literally went dizzy numb my speech was severely slurred and I drooled as I tried watching TV with my children.  Next morning I was unable to drive them to school since I was still unable to clear my vision.  Night 2 I would take and called doc., he said that I needed to give it at least a 30 day cycle but leave out xanax.  I decided to self medicate and changed my dose to 60 mg daily, I bit manic but nice.""",6
Dapsone,Acne,"""Around the age 35 I started experiencing painful and embarrassing cyst acne on my chin. Birth control and spironolacton got it under control to the point I stopped taking it after a few years. It came back as bad a ever and this time the medication wasn&#039;t working. I started aczone about 6 weeks ago and it&#039;s amazing! I do have to make sure I use it daily. If I do start to get any new acne, it knocks it out quickly in just a day or two. Helps a ton with any redness. Very happy with this product.""",4
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""I am 33 years old and have been on this medication for over 5 years, I have always suffered from anxiety and high blood pressure. This medication has helped me more on the anxiety side than my high bp, but then again anxiety contributes to high bp. This has been a miracle drug for me I have been on a low dose of 10mg a day and if I really feel on edge I take 2 a day and that&#039;s it! Because when I take 20mg my heart rate drops to about 60bpm which is pretty relaxing for me and I don&#039;t want to go on a higher dose. When my heart races I automatically take this bad boy and BAM!Can barely feel my heart pounding,which is an extreme relief.if you have anxiety and feel your heart pounding it just makes your anxiety worst,creating a viscous cycle.""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I have been on Claravis for a couple of months now. I developed moderate acne as an adult and it was those difficult ones under your skin that were impossible to get rid of. I tried all the over the counter stuff but I realized that they all have the same ingredients. So even though they sound amazing on T.V, they&#039;re all a waste of money. I was skeptical about Claravis at first but I was just so frustrated. I&#039;m on my 3rd month now and I&#039;ve only gotten ONE pimple since I started it and it was during the first month. As far as the downsides, I&#039;m only really experiencing dry lips and dry skin in patches. But that could be because I have eczema. Other than that, I haven&#039;t experienced anything else.""",4
Accutane,Acne,"""I was(was feels so good) suffering havoc of acne from my 8th grade. Continued till my 12th grade, successfully destroyed my whole teen life. I took hundreds of antibiotic, Proactive, facial packs. All failed completely. Acne actually changed my personality, my image and whole life. After visiting many dermatologist, last(yes last) of them prescribed me Accutane. At first I didn&#039;t take it very seriously but after 1 month my persistent acne started disappearing. All thanks to acne, it puts a full stop to acne problem. I&#039;m still recovering from all psychological disaster played by acne in my life.. But today I m completely acne free and confident that it will never come back. ONE Last advice, don&#039;t think and just go for it!""",4
Phentermine,Obesity,"""UPDATE I started phentermine 1 month ago and have gone down from 250lbs to 229lbs. I exercise 3-4 times a week for an hr usually 25min of T25 and 35 mins or more walking/running my cardio has gotten much better since I started and I can admit I think I&#039;ve become a workout junky. If I don&#039;t exercise for a day or two I feel guilty. Anyhow I&#039;ve also changed my diet completely. I&#039;m on the low carbs diet and it is&#039;nt so bad one cheat day which is Sunday and I count calories also I still eat bread but only 100% wheat bread hopefully once I reach my goal weight which is 139lbs I can keep my exercise and WEIGHT.""",2
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""Horrible medication! It caused me to have medication induced akathesia! I experienced extreme restlessness and uncontrollable tics in my mouth. My legs would continue to jump up and down while sitting! My psychiatrist initially placed me on propranolol to stop these side effects and worked initially. Then, he had to increase the dosage because it came back. Eventually, he had to take me off propranolol and place me on cogentin (Benzotropine mesylate). Cogentin is used for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. That&rsquo;s how bad it got! Never again!""",6
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""Saphris has helped me more than any other medication (which were many, many over 12 years). I was blown away by the benefit and bewildered that it took so long for someone to prescribe it. I still don&#039;t have the strength and energy that I need but I am functioning at 80% to 90%. Before it was barely hanging on with suicidal periods. Savella was another good medication for me but not quite this good. The racing thoughts, paranoia, and insomnia are gone. I usually fall asleep within 15 minutes of lying down. Although I am having some nights of waking up after 3 hours. Just getting to sleep earlier and getting the required sleep I need has made a tremendous difference in how I function and cope. My side effect has been arthritis and weight gain.""",6
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""This medication has worked well for me in terms of controlling my anxiety and fear of having a panic attack.  However the side effects I have had to endure are not so pleasant.  I&#039;m always tired and can sleep all day long.  As well, I have gained weight on this medication and trying to lose it is very hard.  It&#039;s like my metabolism has stopped working. I&#039;ve been on this medicine for about 3 years now and considering weening off to try something else.""",7
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been researching a lot about Victoza/Saxenda before I asked my doctor for a Rx. The reviews about side effects on this site really scared me, but I was determined, so I started using Victoza last week. 

I have not have any negative side effects!

Starting at 0.6 mg I am slowly increasing the dose (on a weekly basis) to max 3 mg per day. Time will tell if side effects increase with a higher dose but what I&#039;ve read so far rather says &quot;if you get through the first 2 weeks you&#039;ll be fine&quot;. 

From the first day on I could feel how I needed less food to feel full. Smaller portions. No cravings for junk, rather for healthy foods.

Oh and the needle doesn&#039;t hurt one bit! I literally can&#039;t feel it!""",2
Ketorolac,Pain,"""I had gotten addicted to Lortab and ask my doctor to take me off it because I just hated not being in control of a medicine. I have Fibromyalgia, so I needed something that would help. After different meds, that did not work, he gave me a shot of Toradol, I was amazed when it took effect! For the first time in a long time my whole body felt pain free. You would think miracle medicine, right? Well, it was however, the side effects of constipation and upset stomach, bloating, heartburn, not urinating enough, the medicine scared me (he also gave me the Toradol pills). I have an appoinment with my doctor tomorrow and I hate that I will have to be taken off this med. If you have great relief with no side effects, it is great!""",9
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed diclegis by my OB for extreme nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Diclegis is not covered by insurance so I researched what it was and it&#039;s basically unisom and Vitamin B6. Now the active ingredient is what is in the sleep tabs, not gels. The gels have diphenhydramine so if you are using this review to help ease nausea during pregnancy, make sure you are buying the sleep tabs. Anyway, I take one tab at night (Check it is the right dose  doxylamine 10mg) and it totally works. I don&#039;t wake up feeling nauseated at all and I sleep through the night. I do feel a little groggy in the AM, but it&#039;s hard to tell if it&#039;s from the pill or pregnancy in general. Upon further research, I discovered that the tabs were originally so designed to help with nausea. Hope this helps!""",0
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking this medication for several weeks now (Effexor XR 37.5mg daily) and it has helped me a lot more than the Celexa I was on. 

Although recently (within the last 10 or so days) I have experienced very mild headaches that last a long time and feeling fatigued all day. Caffeine doesn&#039;t help and extra sleep doesn&#039;t help. 

I&#039;ve had problems with fatigue all my life but this feels different. I am not sure if this is related to the medication because I have not had any side effects and I&#039;ve been on this medication for almost a month now.""",7
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking Divalproex(Depakote)250mg on June 10th and than on June 17th I was admitted into a psychiatric hospital because of my bipolar.  I learned from the psychiatrist there that the dosage I was on was absolutely nothing and would have no effect on me.  The psychiatrist ended up raising the dose to 750mg.  I definetly can tell that my mood is leveled out for the most part. I would recommended this to people with bipolar and people with seizures(I was diagnosed a few years ago with non eptiletic seizures).  So far I dont see any side effects, thank God.  I take this medication at night along with: 
Aripiprazole(Abilify)15mg
Trazodone(Desyrel)50mg
Hydroxyzine(Vistaril)50mg
Clonazepam(Klonopin)1mg""",6
Butorphanol,Pain,"""Omg I was given  Stadol in my arm where my IV was to start. I went to ER for throwing up and throat burning and right side of my throat was closing up like swollen and on fire. They took blood, a pee test and came back with zofran in my IV and had me drink this Cocktail stuff that had lidocaine in it. Made my throat burn worse. I think they gave me WAY too much of Stadol. Weirdest feeling ever!!! Felt like I was flipping backwards, my body was being pulled  forcing my whole body and brain n eyes. Felt so panicky,  freaked out, the worst drunk feeling ever. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. 
Coming down from that scary high. Still can&#039;t stand up by myself. Do not take it. I would rather have the pain than have to take this again""",9
Vraylar,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have tried just about every medicine for bipolar I that is known to man, and none have been effective for me. Was keeping my fingers crossed that Vraylar would be the one that would offer some relief but it proved to be yet another dud. I took this medicine at 2:00 p.m. and at 4:00 p.m. I could barely keep my eyes open anymore. I then proceeded to sleep for 24 hours, waking up only once or twice for about 5 minutes to go to the bathroom! When I finally did wake-up the next afternoon I was extremely sedated and I had the typical zombified feeling that comes along with taking an anti-psychotic. Not to mention, I was on the lowest dose of 1.5 mg. I would hate to see what 3 or 6 mg would have done to me.""",6
Vicodin,Pain,"""I have been dealing with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis since 2003. A rare form of the disease that only affects 10% of the MS community. Many people know someone with MS, but very few with this form. To this day I have been repeatedly reminded by the medical society there are no known medications to treat this condition. Vicodin 10/660 has helped with the variety of MS pains and has also eased the mental stress and allowed me to think clearer. I have been allowed to try everything in stock but always come back here. I have not drank alcohol this entire time frame and use Miralax daily to avoid constipation. Hope this helps and God bless.""",9
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""I started taking this med 4 weeks ago. Before that I was extremely slowly losing but had changed my lifestyle with walking, Eating low carb and an extremely clean diet. I have lost 3 lbs this month but the meds made me exhausted and nauseated most days. I could not do my light work outs or even walk.  Not wanting to eat much at all and what I did was not the healthiest as everything made me sick so I would eat stuff that would go down easy.  I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s counter productive to a healthy lifestyle change.  I even backed off the dosage. Not sure what to do. I paid for three months so wanted to finish but ugh not feeling this.""",3
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Was taking 175 mg of Seroquel to sleep - experimenting with dosage. Felt overtired and crusty. Weaned down to 100mg, then 75 at nighttime. Active adult male who works out regularly, eats well, but gets agitated. Any less than 75 mg mental mania slowly starts back-unpleasant. Would like to not take but the doctor wants me to substitute Lithium. No change with hair loss and diabetes as side effects. """,6
Duloxetine,Pain,"""I have been using Cymbalta for two of years for neuropathic pain in my feet. It works very well most of the time at the 90mg dose I am taking daily. There are days when I have done some activity that aggravates my back and I have to take an extra 30 mg. This helps but I experience the hot flashes at the 120 dose. I do not have the night terrors but there are times when I have run out of the prescription and if I have not had it for a day I get very vivid dreams. They are not scary but if I wake up from one I&#039;m up until I settle my brain down. Erectile Dysfunction has been a problem and I address it with Cialis or Viagra which are expensive even with my coverage. Reducing the dose to 60mg the day before sex helps.""",9
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have never had a worse experience on a birth control before- but don&#039;t get me wrong, for some people this works! But for me, my moods were totally insane, completely up and down and I could not control my emotions. I felt constantly depressed and my sex drive basically disappeared. On top of that, I gained 15 pounds and COULD NOT LOSE IT. I was the heaviest I&#039;ve ever been on this birth control. I really can&#039;t stress enough how much it affected me mentally though, it was intense and everyone around me had to go through my terrible mood swings and anger too. I personally could not recommend this to anyone because of the side affects I endured. I got the implant out 7 months later and lost the weight I had gained and started feeling better.""",8
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on the depo for about 7 years (I&#039;m 25) . It&#039;s the only contraceptive that I could use, because I have a gene in my blood stream that makes me twice as likely to get blood clots then any other person without it. I had no issues what so ever being on it I never spotted, I never gained weight. I had an overall good experience being on it. Now, I&#039;ve been off of it since May 2015. I started spotting in August - a sign that my body is going back to normal ish. My withdrawal symptoms are starting to suck. Over the last three days I&#039;ve had nothing but severe cramping, that I can&#039;t function with. Today (being the third day) I&#039;m finally experiencing a normal period. Which, the pain yeah it sucks, but its a sign my body&#039;s trying to go back to normal""",8
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""I just started taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg recently after being off of it for almost a year. During that year I found myself dropping my kids off at school and coming home and sleeping all day. I stopped taking it because my insurance would no longer cover the brand name. After being on and off of this drug for many years I can tell you there is a HUGE difference between generic and brand. When I took bupropion I was very short tempered, irritable and my hair started to fall out! This is not listed as a side effect and my doctor and pharmacist also assured me this is not a known side effect. After some research I found many women have hair loss on bupropion. For me its worth the $ to pay for brand name.""",5
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""Everyone&#039;s body is different so I was unsure of how mine would react, but I&#039;ve had a pretty good experience with depo. I started the beginning of my junior year in high school because my periods were so bad that I would miss school because of cramping. Just taking regular Tylenol or ibuprofen wouldn&#039;t lessen the pain. So we decided to go and see if could try something that would help. And the Depo has been amazing for me. I don&#039;t have periods although for the first month and a half I did spot on and off. I do sometimes get small cramps but they are nothing like they were and they&#039;re only around the time I should be on. My moods are pretty good, I&#039;m not depressed although I do get angrier a little easier. Best of all I&#039;ve lost 10lbs.""",8
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Belviq about 6 weeks ago.  When I visited with my Doctor to ask about Belviq, he was very apprehensive, as he&#039;d had a few traumatic experiences related to Phen-Phen.  We discussed it at length and he reluctantly agreed to provide me with a prescription, with the caveat that I check in with him once a month.  Well, in my first month, I lost 12 lbs!  Side effects - initial, some constipation and dry mouth - increased fluid intake and both disappeared.  I do feel &quot;foggy&quot; at times, sleep deeply and find it hard to wake up.  Otherwise, all is well and I&#039;m finding the side effects decreasing with time.  Looking forward to continuing the positive trajectory and getting back to pre-preggo weight!""",3
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Taking isotretinoin is the best decision I made to treat my acne. It was only 7 months ago I was helplessly looking through these forums for advice and experiences from ex users of the medicine. Acne was dominating my thoughts, and you become very self conscious. The first 4 months are slow improvements, however in others, by 4 months their acne has cleared. Taking the medicine makes your lips dry, but I advice you cleanse and moisturize everyday, and use a lip balm or pawpaw cream. If you play sports this medicine is perfectly fine. THE BEST ADVICE I have however is not too have caffeine in your diet, this is essential, a good diet is also good, and exercise everyday. I highly, highly recommend taking this medicine, it changed my life.""",4
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I just started Saxenda on 9/2/16. After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical, I know side effects for weight loss medications tend to be very uncomfortable. I started on the 0.6 dosage, weighting 286 and I am now on day 6. I weighed myself this morning and I am 278.2 (7.8 pounds down). I am sure this is probably water weight, but it is still weight off so I&#039;m happy.
I try to work out or walk everyday but during the past 6 days I have only been able to make it 3 days. And my eating has not been the best either. I could only imagine what I would have lost if I was to actually stick to my healthy foods and exercise. So far I have not experienced any side effects! YAY!
I make sure to eat breakfast/lunch/dinner even if it is just fruit..""",3
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have tried so many medications for my numerous manic episodes and nothing even came close to the benefits I have experienced with Saphris. It reduced my anxiety and agitation profoundly. I have not had another episode after being on Saphris for over six months. I have an overall sense of well being and much more functional. I&#039;ve lost 50lbs after being on Zyprexa. Saphris is a wonderful medicine and has given me hope and I am slowly rebuilding my life. It might taste really bad but it is all worth it.""",6
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Klonopin has improved my quality of life exponentially. I feel as though it opened up this new world around me -- one that was always there, but I was just too nervous to experience it. It&#039;s also the only medication that helps me fall asleep fast without feeling groggy the next morning.

That being said, it is a benzodiazepine, so taking it every day isn&#039;t a good idea, and the potential for addiction and tolerance is there. In combination with talk therapy, this medication can help you live a life free of fear and worry.""",7
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 22 year old female who was diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive subtype following my freshman yr of college. 
I&#039;ve been taking Vyvanse for 3 yrs now (initially 30 mg, now 50 mg) and finally feel like I&#039;m living up to my potential. For the first time ever, I am able to stay organized, complete tasks and actually show up on time! 
My only complaints are lack of appetite throughout day (ravenous at night) and the desire for a cigarette for the first 2 hrs after it &quot;kicks in&quot; (never crave one when I&#039;m not taking Vyvanse).

Meperidine,Pain,"""After a fall and suffering a slow decline into osteoarthritis of the right hip, I had been managing pain with Vicodin for the last two years before I went for total joint replacement. Maybe I had built up a tolerance because after surgery, my pain was mind-boggling until it vanished &quot;just like that&quot;. I asked the nurse what she just gave me and she said she tried a little Demerol via I.V. Amazing stuff when morphine didn&#039;t do it for me!!""",9
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""I have struggled with ADD since I was in grade school. Although diagnosed, my mother was not about putting me on medication. That being said I struggled really bad until I graduated. I am now 22 &amp; have been out on almost any ADD/ADHD medication you can think of. To keep it short &amp; sweet, Concerta &amp; focalin worked for about an hour then I turned into a horrible person to be around - extreme mood swings, aggression, agitation, really easily annoyed, &amp; hostile. My doctor decided to put me on Adderall XR 10mg tablets &amp; let me tell you it has saved my life!!!!!! It lasts all day for me, I am more focused, my heart rate doesn&#039;t jump to extremes like it did on Focalin. It actually makes me more relaxed &amp; enjoyable to be around. 10/10""",1
Tramadol,Pain,"""Tramadol is a very good medication for moderately severe pain. For Bad Pain, taking it with an NSAID markedly improves it&#039;s effectiveness, as you are now acting systemically on both the inflammation and neurologic components of pain. Taking it with a caffeinated beverage, (such as cola, or coffee, etc), can also help, as can B Complex &amp; Magnesium.  Hot or Cold packs to the affected area (depends if the painful area feels Hot or Cold, one will make it better, the other one makes it worse usually in my experience). Also massage may also help. Acupuncture works synergistically I have found. Note: There are many &quot;Generics&quot; for this Med, Only the original &quot;Brand&quot; &amp; The Mylan Generic really work the same in my experience.""",9
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda 0.6 on 8/23/17.  It is now 8/28/17 and I&#039;m down almost 5 lbs.  I have increased to 1.2 because the side effects were going away.  I have noticed I am only eating about half as much as I used to eat.  I never feel hungry.  I did feel hypoglycemic one day, but ate something and felt better.  The side effects were not too bad, bloating, a little nausea.  I am optimistic about this drug.  All the others I have tried gave me terrible side effects.""",2
Belviq,Obesity,"""I started taking this because my doctor insisted in me trying something after many failed programs after I read most of you guys reviews I gave it a try and the 1st day I felt weird as hell had a tingling feeling on my left hand and a headache from hell but after my 2nd day it&#039;s like I don&#039;t feel a thing maybe only a headache but ibuprofen took care of that. I would tell anyone scared to try it give it at least two days. And I believe you&#039;ll love it. I&#039;m starting out with 266 pounds.""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Implanon 3 months ago. Even with an above average amount of bruising after insertion, it only hurt when I put weight on my arm and it only lasted for a few days. I got my period a few days after insertion.  It lasted 7 days and was fairly heavy for 5 of those days.  This made me nervous that I was gonna be one of the unlucky people who never stopped bleeding, but it&#039;s been over 60 days since I&#039;ve had any bleeding.  So if you do have some heavy bleeding at first, that doesn&#039;t mean you will bleed the entire time you have it. That was my biggest concern before getting it. I have no negative side effects and it&#039;s so much more convenient than pills.  My experience so far has been fantastic!""",8
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I have been dealing with thigh pain/numbness and tingles for almost two years from a pinched nerve in my thigh and lower back. Doctors always say LOSE WEIGHT! Well easier said than done. I am not that over weight. Finally met with a SMART neurologist. He said throw away the meds they had me on before which did nothing but MAKE me gain weight (Nortriptyline). He put me on Gabapentin 800mg. I was told to take half tablet three times a day unless I needed more, which I don&#039;t. It has been three days..First time in almost two years I sleep through the night because the irritation is GONE. I sleep all night like a baby, wake up refreshed, have ZERO pain in my leg. My coworkers say I am pleasant now. I have NO anxiety now as well! LOVE IT!""",9
Olanzapine,Insomnia,"""I used Zyprexa (2.5mg) at night for insomnia caused by anxiety and obsessive thoughts. It is the only thing that helped me sleep that is not addictive and actually worked. It also helped my appetite because when I don&#039;t sleep well I don&#039;t feel like eating much either. This medication helped with that also. Unfortunately I cannot use it often because it causes my blood sugar to shoot up sky high and I don&#039;t like the risk of tardive dyskinesia.

Sertraline,Depression,"""I am in my early 50s.  The &quot;docs&quot; gave me this med initially for &quot;stress&quot;.  I was referred to a &quot;psychiatrist&quot; right after &amp; I complied.

I took the medication as prescribed (25mg), &amp; had to endure 1 week of agony, but figured it was part of &quot;the drug&quot;.  I had muscle twitches, sweating, hot/cold sensation was thrown off, Blood pressure would shoot up &amp; drop low, NO SLEEP at all for 1 week, before the &quot;medication&quot; took hold.

Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I take 10mg 11 hours before I want to wake up.  It helps me sleep through the night.  I&#039;ve always been a light sleeper.  I do not have problems falling to sleep, but in the last five or six years I wake up about every hour or so, once I&#039;ve been asleep more than 2-3 hours.  I was tired throughout the day.  This really helps me stay asleep through the night.  Not always, but so much better than before.  I&#039;m much more alert during the day.  I&#039;m taking a very low dose, and it is not very expensive.  My doctor noticed my symptoms and recommended I try this, as it is non-narcotic, non-addicting and relatively inexpensive.

Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Absolutely hate this birth control! The day I got it in my arm bleed for 5-10 minutes before I was even out of the doctors office. Then I had my period for about a month so they gave me estrogen to stop it and I just ended up breaking out in hives for a month. I&#039;ve gained tons of weight that I never gained on 3 years of the depo shot. I got it it November of 2015 and haven&#039;t stopped bleeding since about a week after I got it.

Currently on week 3 of Contrave.

Started to feel better by end of 2nd week, still dizzy but not debilitating. Usually workout 4x/week and can&#039;t because of dizziness. Increased to 3/day yesterday and the side effects are almost as bad as 1st week. I have noticed I don&#039;t have the cravings I usually do and can say no to food.

Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I suffer from depression. This drug not only worked quickly, but didn&#039;t have any of the sexual side effects I was concerned about in other types of anti-depressants. It also helped concentration.

Wellbutrin did none of that for me, I would recommend it to anyone suffering from depression.""",5
Apri,Birth Control,"""I switched to Apri because my insurance company didn&#039;t approve Tri Lo MARZIA.  I got put on birth control because of my heavy periods.  After a week on Apri, I started to have migraines every 3 days.  I would throw up and it would make me really moody and I would cry at the drop of a hat.  When we told the insurance company what was going on,  they wouldn&#039;t pay for the Tri Lo Marzia.  So,  I got a GoodRX card to help with the cost.""",8
Oxycodone,Pain,"""My doctor had to cut into my jawbones to extract my wisdom teeth that hadn&#039;t come in yet to ease the pain in my mouth. He put me on the oxycodone 10/650mg. They work wonders. While I was taking them I didn&#039;t even care if my mouth hurt. Then I got real bad migraines and the doctor thought they was caused by the pain pills. He switched me to something else and now I am still in pain. All in all I say oxycodone was excellent.""",9
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I just started taking 100 mg twice a day five days ago.  I have degenerative joint disease, osteopenia, arthritis, etc.  Mainly, my neck and hips just kill me!  Sometimes I can&#039;t get to sleep, sometimes I wake up feeling absolutely pitiful. I&#039;ve only been taking ibuprofen 600 mg 3 x day.  Since starting the gabapentin (ALSO started effexor same day) I am able to sleep and it doesn&#039;t hurt all the time.  I am sleepy a lot.  It&#039;s worth it not to hurt.""",9
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking a Drug called Brintellix for a few days now. I take one pill in mornings with breakfast and for the first time in years  I have became active, creative, happy and I have the will to get up and be motivated.  I felt like my old self but younger. I haven&#039;t been on the med long but so far I&#039;m amazed. I can&#039;t tolerate other antidepressants and they don&#039;t work for me.  So right now I&#039;m living life and not just watching life pass by. I recommended talking to your Dr about Brintellix if you&#039;re living like I was.""",5
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""Instead of calming me down and relaxing me from my anxiety and panicky feelings it made them extremely worse. I thought I was going to loose my mind. Well actually for a brief time I did. It caused me to have a nervous breakdown. This was only on the second day I took it. I didn&#039;t know what was going on or what was happening. I thought I was going to loose my mind and before I knew it I slit one of my wrist. I have never had any intention of doing this before taking Ativan. Thankful help came and I got 8 staples put in my wrist were I cut it. I will never take this medicine ever again. I just warn to be very careful taking this medicine. I have never had any reactions to medicines before until this medicine I took back in Sept 16, 2015.""",7
Topiramate,Obesity,"""I was prescribed topiramate for daily post-concussive headaches, and I also needed to lose weight.  The first three weeks were really rough, and I was unsure if I could take this medicine long-term.  I started off with 25mg the first week, 50mg the second, 75mg the third, then 100mg as my permanent dose.  I took it before bedtime as instructed, but I had next day drowsiness so bad that for three weeks I felt like I was going to face plant at any moment.  Also, the nausea was so bad that I barely ate.  Thankfully, both of these side effects stopped after about 3 weeks as did most of my headaches.  I&#039;ve also lost 22 lbs in 2 months.  The best part is that it has given me control back in that I eat smart and don&#039;t have unhealthy cravings.""",2
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve always been an anxious person, usually I find my anxiety serves me well to stay on top of a busy household, but occasionally the anxiety is destructive instead, like after the birth of a child or difficult times. 
I&#039;d had a horrid couple of years, nursing my mum to the end from cancer and eventually it caught up with me, panic attacks, health anxiety, obsession on breathing, palpitations constantly. 
I went straight onto 20mg as had been on this drug briefly a decade ago. 
The first 24 hours were weird, dizzy, disorientated, mildly nauseous and a huge panic attack. I only slept 3 hours a night for the first 2-3 days. By week 3 I sleep 8hrs a night, have energy during the day and zero anxiety. I feel great! Lexapro is great but be patient""",7
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I have been taking amitriptyline on and off for over three years after a serious road accident, where my pelvis was crushed and I suffered major nerve damage. It really really works, but I am trying to get off it permanently because of the side effects. It helps with pain and sleep, which are my two biggest complaints, but the side effects of constipation, dry mouth and a weight gain of 50 pounds (from 120 to 170) are really quite terrible, especially when taken in connection with other side effect causing drugs. I would be very careful about taking this drug. It&#039;s very important to weigh the costs vs benefits. Since I was a trauma patient, I didn&#039;t have much choice in the matter and I am still living with the consequences.""",9
Mydayis,ADHD,"""I was prescribed 50 mg. 1st day I could literally feel the release of the medication. During the lag of the release I would get headaches, become tired, irritable and frustrated with every situation and conversation. By evening time I couldn&#039;t carry a conversation without forgetting prior known facts. Saturday ,I was completely not myself. On top of how I felt 
Friday I was emotional, had down thoughts, I couldn&#039;t follow a time line: I was late for everything. Sunday seemed to be better but not by much. Monday..horrible it was like I added Friday and 
Saturday symptoms together then add in horrible chest pain, shortness of breath, constant feeling of about to faint, fever, flu symptoms, hot/cold, exhausted but not able to sleep, &amp; more symptoms. I refuse to take another dose""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking adipex on March 19th, weighing 256 lbs (5&#039;10&quot; 32 year old female). I took it every day around lunch time ( took it for only 12 days).. Its now Thursday and I haven&#039;t taken it since last Friday because I still have NO appetite.. I have to make myself eat.. No side effects besides extreme dry mouth, I drink over a gallon of water a day.. and I weighed myself today and I&#039;m 238. So I&#039;m down 18 lbs with only using it for 2 weeks.. I find this medicine extremely helpful and am so thankful someone told me about it!""",3
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I have only been on this medicine for about two weeks at 20mg but it has completely changed me! It&#039;s awesome! I suffer from Depression, Anxiety, and ADD and was prescribed Lexapro to help with me depression and anxiety, it bumped up my mood a little but I still had depression and anxiety symptoms. The first day I took Vyvanse it kicked in after an hour and automatically I was more awake, happy, confident, talkative, and focused! It helped me so much with college when before I was failing almost all my classes I am in such a better mood now LIFE IS GREAT! The only down side so far is it makes me really hungry at times and I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep through out the night but it&#039;s worth it!!""",1
Clonidine,ADHD,"""My son used various stimulants for yrs for ADHD and ODD. Now 10, newly diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) and still struggling because of impulsiveness &amp; high metabolism, the docs added non-stimulants.  Intuniv dropped his bp way too low. Clonidine IR worked GREAT the 1st 2 days, then okay. Changed to Kapvay for long-acting effects, but we stopped because of awful insomnia for 2 weeks. I rated Clonidine IR as an 8 because when we went back to Clonidine IR, his insomnia stopped and it decreased his impulsiveness.  It just stinks that he has to take it over and over again because it&#039;s short acting.""",1
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m just starting week two of the 15 day trial.  I&#039;m down 5 lbs which to me is good, since I had two days I was up slightly, (dang those margaritas).  but I figured on those two days, there would not be any change or a slight increase just because I was eating differently.  I&#039;m thankful that I haven&#039;t had the headaches, or dizziness.  I have been extremely tired and hoping that this will soon pass. I have noticed that I do eat a lot less then I usually would and I crave fruits and veggies.  Hoping to stay on track better this week, but I&#039;m loving it so far :)""",3
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I recently sought help from a psychiatrist and he prescribed me starter doses of Lamictal. He also gave me samples of Latuda for if I began to notice myself experiencing an episode. I noticed that I began to have a quick decline in to depression after a hypomanic state and reluctantly began to take the Latuda. It is AMAZING. After only 5 days of use, I already feel so much better.  Today  I just noticed that I am not depressed anymore, as I was a few days ago. I am able to take better care of my body (eating better, exercise) because I already am feeling so much better. I get very sleepy and some akathisia, I just take it at night to avoid those side effects.""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started this medication a little over a month ago. I seemed to have a lot more energy at first and as of today I&#039;ve lost 10 lbs. A few days ago however, I began experiencing chest tightness and shortness of breath. I went to my PCP who then sent me to the ER. I completed multiple tests and stayed overnight in the hospital for evaluation. Everything came back without any definitive answers as to the symptoms I&#039;ve been experiencing. Several doctors mentioned that they believe the Phentermine to be the cause and recommended that I stop using it. It is now day 4 without taking any and I&#039;m still feeling the same symptoms. Only time will tell... if I feel better after a week then I suppose they were correct.""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""I was fortunate to have found an effective method of treatment for my depression after trying only a few different medications.  I began with Lexapro, which gave me drymouth, provided little relief and resulted in an uncomfortable feeling if a dosage was missed.  Cymbalta gave me a constant headache.  I started on 20mg of Celexa and after a few weeks I felt more like myself.  I have been taking 40mg for three years and have had great results with few side effects.  Mild decreased in sex drive.""",5
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""This is the first time I took unisom. I&#039;m pregnant and have been having trouble sleeping. I took it the first night and I as asleep within 30 minutes. It was the best sleep I&#039;ve had in awhile and woke up feeling great but the second night taking it didn&#039;t go so well. It didn&#039;t make me drowsy one bit. I tried taking a second pill and nothing worked. I&#039;m not sure why it worked the first night for me but not the second. :(""",0
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""Please please please.......If your doctor suggests this drug to you, do your research. I am 18 and just put full trust in my doctor when she told me to take it. 7 months later and I wish I never ever took it. I usually take my 150mg dose when I wake up in the morning and now I cannot even go until 11 pm at night if I forget to take it without having withdrawals. I experience nausea and feel uneasy on my feet as well as shakiness. It is ridiculous and  I write this to stress that this is not a light topic. BE CAREFUL!!!!!""",5
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""Diagnosed ADHD, Bipolar, Major Depression, GAD, Panic disorder. Have been on Saphris 5 mg at night for 1 week. After the first dose I could tell a huge difference in my mood. For the first time in months I woke up in a great mood. After a few days, I knew I was no longer in mania. Which I&#039;ve been in for at least 4 mths. My thinking is back to normal. The only problem I&#039;m having is keeping my mood stabilized. When I take it at night it puts me to sleep in 15 min. No longer using sleeping meds. For one week of use I think it&#039;s a great medicine.""",6
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""Did not work very well for me. My main problem is waking up in the middle of the night, worrying, and not being able to fall back asleep. I&#039;ve tried taking 15 mgs before going to bed, and it really has no effect. Still wake up in the middle of the night, with anxiety. 

On the plus side, it really had no side effects to speak of. On the minus side, it really had no effects at all. Maybe the dosage was too low for me? Don&#039;t know, but it was exactly the same as if I had taken nothing at all.""",0
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have just started taking this medicine. I just took my third dose about 30 minutes ago. The first night taking the medicine was difficult. Bad taste - definitely. My legs were fidgety and I tossed and turned for about 4 hours (very unusual for me, I normally sleep like a rock). I could hardly get out of bed for more than 10 minutes the first day. Dizziness was very bad. I took the second dose about 16 hours after the first dose (4pm on day 2). The 2nd day has been a bit better. I was able to get on the exercise bike for a few minutes even. This is my third day. I took the third dose at 8:30 am. I am working up to taking 5mg every 12 hours, but am not there yet. I have a follow-up with the doctor in a couple days. """,6
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I wasI was on many medications it didn&#039;t work until my doctor prescribe xanax to milligrams 4 times a day what a godsend. I found the other medications like klonopin didn&#039;t work as effectively. I couldn&#039;t go to work without having a panic attack or in a situation with the family. people don&#039;t understand life can be tough go with the proper medication you can become better. I was on Zoloft it didn&#039;t work so the doctor prescribed me xanax which was very helpful. people should ask your doctor for a prescription I have severe anxiety it will help.I&#039;ve been on it for 2 years and it&#039;s been very helpful. I hope people see the light and try it has a bad reputation but it is it wonder drug.""",7
Armodafinil,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADD as a child, but my parents never put me on the drugs. At 30 I decided to see how the other half lived. Concerta, Vyvance, Focalin, etc, I&#039;ve been prescribed them all. Most are pretty effective, but the jitters, nerves, sleeplesness, etc. were rough. I was prescribed Nuvigil because I didn&#039;t want the amphetamine base anymore and I had heard about it. Insurance wasn&#039;t happy, but it was approved. It is fantastic. My only complaint, and I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s pretty rare, is that it makes me sleepy for the 1st week or so until my body adjusts. After that, clarity. No jitters, no moodiness, no sleep issues, nada. The mood elevating  effects are nice too. It might not work for many this way but I would be lost without it.""",1
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""With no medicines I am the world&#039;s laziest housekeeper - no kidding.  With Ritalin, I am still that, but I do very well at work.  I tried Adderall because it was cheaper and it didn&#039;t help my concentration at work, but I painted the floor and the ENTIRE inside of my house, a complete renovation - needed no sleep, almost at all.  While it&#039;s great to be so productive, physically, I have to try something else, because I feel like I&#039;m on full throttle.""",1
Accutane,Acne,"""I didn&#039;t mind my acne too much, but it got really annoying when my parents were complaining about it over time. I tried to reduce the amount of acne. I&#039;ve tried several over the counter products, some worked, some didn&#039;t. Sadly, I did have an increased breakout after using Ortho Tri-Cyclen. Then I went to my doctor. First, I&#039;ve tried Clindoxyl, then Benzoyl peroxide (0.1%/2.5% w/w). Worked fine, but results did not last too long. Then I was on tetracycline for a few months. It worked, for awhile, then I had an increased breakout.
Finally, I got on Accutane. I was really reluctant to be on Accutane because of its side effects, especially when my doctor highlighted suicidal thoughts, and decreased night vision. But after four months, I&#039;m currently happy with the results!""",4
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got this birth control in November 2014. I definitely DON&#039;T recommend it! yeah, it stops you from becoming pregnant, but it made me have bad mood swings, worse depression than I already had, my stomach is always hurting and I&#039;ve been on my period for a rind 2 months now. I would stop for a day and it will start back up the next. I&#039;ve gained 20 pounds since I got it! I have NO energy ever! and b12 don&#039;t help neither. oh and I&#039;m never happy. I can&#039;t get myself to be happy unless I&#039;m with my daughter and sometimes the small things she does makes me have another mood swing. I just don&#039;t recommend this!""",8
Nucynta,Pain,"""Prescribed 100mg every six to eight hours for lower back muscular pain.  Relieves symptoms and along with PT has provided relief.  I only take it when the pain flares up.  There was an initial instance or two of psychedelic like effects the first two or three times I took Nucynta and went to bed.  Seem to sleep okay after taking Nucynta now.  Provides much better relief than Oxycodone did.  Have experienced some tiredness while taking.""",9
Accutane,Acne,"""I&#039;m up to my 4th month of Accutane and overall I&#039;m happy with it. My advice to people thinking about trying it is just give it a go! You won&#039;t know until you try it, and biggest piece of advice is to know your body&#039;s limits. If you&#039;re on a high dose and for example your lips are dry enough that its affecting your daily life, just lower your dose! Easy as that. Talk to your dermatologist and tell them how you&#039;re feeling about it and they&#039;ll be happy for you to stick to a dosage that both improves your skin and keeps the rest of your body happy.""",4
Lyrica,Pain,"""I have had a fusion of L4 and L5 in 2004 was doing fine until last year when I began to have pain in my low back and right leg accompanied with numbness and tingling down the leg. I also managed to severely rupture a few discs in my neck while stretching of all things. Was misdiagnosed by the surgeon who only fixed one of the ruptures with a fusion of C7. Off course this still left me with pain and numbness from my neck down both arms. About a month or so ago I switched to a spine and pain management doctor and he put me on the Lyrica (75mg 3x daily) and a Duragesic patch. These two drugs have worked wonders for my pain and Quality of life. 
The only side effect is that my short term memory is a little sketchy and my mind doesn&#039;t want to shut down.""",9
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I was waking up tired, everyday, gaining wieght like crazy. I thought for sure it was my thyroid. I went to the dr the beginning of June, had blood test set on the fact that it was my thyroid - nope! It was just my eating habits, June 6, 2016 I wieghed 296#s the heaviest I had ever been. It was my own fault, i never felt full. I talked with my Dr. about a lot of differwnt options long story story short... now November 12 i am under 240# and I have control of my eating habits. I have not noticed any side affects other than feeling great and wanting to make healthy choices, sleeping better, losing and chaning my life. Thank you Qysmia and Dr. Cambell""",2
Estazolam,Insomnia,"""I have had insomnia for years. In 1991 I had surgery for ovarian cancer. The chemo made me very nervous.  My dr. Prescribed this medicine and it worked great.  Since then, I have continued to take.  I have worked in a health food store for years and have tried all the natural supplements.  So far this is the best and safest medication I have taken.  I usually only need 1 mg. at night.  I also have irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia and it works great for it also.  My dr. said this medicine is much safer than over the counter sleep aids.""",0
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking low dose .5mg xanax for a few years for social anxiety and occasional panic attacks. It&#039;s excellent. I take it as needed, which I like, it lets me feel more in control. I rarely take a full dose. It&#039;s very effective even in a lower dose. It just lets me keep anxiety under control so I can function well. I never notice any major fogginess or anything with it either unlike other benzos I&#039;ve taken like ativan. Just in moderation. A little goes a long way. Absolutely great medication for anxiety and occasional severe panic attacks. It has completely helped me build my confidence up and get my life back!""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am 18 but I have been taking vyvanse since I was 16 years old at 70mg and still taking the same dose. It is 100% better than concerta XL it has changed my life 

The appetite is not the worst thing I just get really dehydrated and not notice it I can eat after taking it ( 4h after taking it) 

Keep in mind I have been on stimulant like meds for years now I have grown to fight the appetite effects""",1
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""Abilify is the only antipsychotic that works for me. The extreme hunger, lethargy, restlessness, and memory problems I had on other antipsychotics are nonexistent with abilify. I was in the middle of a severe depressive episode when I took it and it only took several weeks for me to be back to normal functioning. I sleep better, have more energy, and fewer mood swings. This medication is great. I find that it is more &quot;activating&quot; while other drugs in the same class like Zyprexa are more &quot;tranquilizing.&quot;""",6
Effexor XR,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on tons of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications throughout the years.  When I started taking Effexor XR, I was thrilled- I felt so much better... minus all of the side effects.  The side effects are just awful.  I sweat constantly, I have awful headaches, no sex drive, and I gained 15 pounds.  And now the medication has stopped working sort of... I don&#039;t feel sad or happy... I just kind of feel here.  I&#039;ve tried to get off of Effexor but I get those brain zaps/vertigo feelings and vomit so I stop and keep taking it.  I guess it helps some people but if I can ever get off of it, I will be going back to another medication.""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the Mirena IUD placed in July of 2007, 6 months after my husband and I had our first baby. My doctor recommended it over the Paraguard. When the doctor was placing it, I was extremely uncomfortable. However, I felt back to normal after two days. There was mild spotting for the first couple of weeks, but that stopped. Then my period stopped. In fact, I haven&#039;t seen my period since 2007. I haven&#039;t felt any different since I had it placed. The only thing that could be a bother about this is the strings, it feels like fishing line. The doctor said the strings would soften over time and they did within the first year. I love Mirena!""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m a 52 year old women, moderately active through golfing and walking, and a relatively healthy eater who never has dieted and didn&#039;t need to.  Menopause, age, activity level and metabolism has each contributed to a 35-40 lbs weight gain.  After a year of increased activity and reduction of calories and carbs such as pasta, potatoes and breads, I was not able to really maintain a 5-10lbs weight loss if I didn&#039;t walk at least 5 miles each day.  I noticed there was an overall reduction in energy.  My doctor had been on this journey with me; food journals to now Phen. 37.5 mg.  In 12 days I&#039;ve lost 8.6 lbs.  I do have a dry mouth and a suppressed appetite which I hope over the 3 month prescription will help me to reduce portions considerably.""",3
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m 21 years old, and have been diagnosed as major depressive and having generalized anxiety since I was 17. Since then I&#039;ve been on three different antidepressants from citalopram to Zoloft, and they all had mediocre effects on my depression. It wasn&#039;t until I saw a new psychiatrist and had a new diagnosis of bipolar l that I started to experience genuine relief. I attribute most of my recovery to Latuda. In the first weeks of taking this medicine I experienced terrible akathisia (the feeling of tickles or ants in your body) which kept me up at night, but after a few weeks I was told to take it with my trazadone (my sleeping pill) at night and the sensation went away. It was probably only a few weeks when I began to feel normal.""",6
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 17 and have been taking 18mg Concerta every day for a week and a half. This is the second medication I&#039;ve tried after being diagnosed with ADHD (I was also diagnosed with major depression). First I tried Adderall, and while it made me feel very alert and productive, I could not handle the severe depressed feelings from the comedown. So far Concerta has made me feel productive and positive for about 3 hours, and then depression slowly creeps in and gets progressively worse for about 8 more hours. It&#039;s not as intense as the depression from Adderall (which even led to suicidal thoughts), but it lasts longer. I also become irritable, anxious, and tired. I&#039;ve also lost weight because trying to eat makes me feel queasy.""",1
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""I have been on Wellbutrin XL for a little over a year, and it has dramatically improved my quality of life. I have struggled with depression for almost my entire life, and only recently sought out treatment, and WOW, what a difference! Wellbutrin didn&#039;t cause any weight gain - if anything I lost some weight - and it didn&#039;t decrease my sex drive. It took about a month for it to kick in, but it was well worth it.""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""It&#039;s been about 9 months since I stopped taking Accutane. I had really bad acne on my back and chest and tried everything and Accutane was the only thing that worked. The acne on my face was pretty bad but not as bad as the other places while I was on Accutane I never got any pimples but about 2 months after I stopped, it all came back on my face. I&#039;m considering taking it again but I experienced some memory loss, backaches, bloodshot eyes, and my lips are still always very dry. It worked amazing on my back and chest though and I haven&#039;t had a pimple there since.""",4
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My 13-year old son is ADHD and has oppositional defiance disorder. He takes Adderall for his ADHD and 4 months ago we added Intuniv. He complains of being tired and he is only on 1 mg of the Intuniv. I have concerns because he is becoming increasingly aggressive and emotional. I do not know if this is a side effect of Intuniv. I&#039;ll be taking him back to the doctor and I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be continuing the Intuniv.""",1
Methadone,Pain,"""I have been taking methadone HCL 10 mg tablets for 10 years for chronic pain. I love this medication greatly and yes it&#039;s a lifesaver for sure. I had been on everything from Ultram to Oxy 80. I can tell you that this medication blows them all away. I started out on 3 a day for 8 years and in the last 2 years I have been on 4 a day. My pain is managed to about 96%. It seems to take a really long time for immunity to set in. This is the best pain medicine on the market. """,9
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""Mania and especially mixed mania are the problem. Geodon is my solution. I took myself off because of mouth moves. Bad move? Almost divorced. I can tell when I am manic because I have ideas and insights. Example: the graph of user ratings for geodon treatment of bipolar is itself bipolar. I was doing 3x80mg when the moves started. Back to 1x80 now. Will report back. p.s. great site. I&#039;ve been here many times but my first post. Thought I should contribute.""",6
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I have suffered from chronic pain since I was 19. I&#039;ve taken just about everything available to treat this curse. After about 5 years of refusing Gabapentin, I finally tried it. Don&#039;t let the side effects scare you, try it for at least a week and let your body and mind get used to it. This stuff really works for pain relief. Also, the combination of this with your narcotic pain relievers will help greatly. The key to treating pain is moderation and avoiding alchohol. I have had great success combining my pain reliever with this and Naproxen or APAP. Help with depression , mood and sleeping. Some side effects can be dizziness. As your body gets used to this it will start working subtly and relieve your pain and help you rest.""",9
Amitriptyline,Depression,"""Im a 58 year old male. Ive had depression problems for most of my life. I have a normal home life and am a fairly normal person. Ive had doctors give me probably 100s of different meds to combat depression. I have educated myself on how to deal with the symtoms . Every doctor i have seen for this always told me that i just need to find the right medication and they were right. Its taken years but amitriptiline has changed my life. Im amazed the difference it has made. My thinking is clear and my mood stable. I believe if i had this medication early in my life many things would be different . finding the right med is everything.. Good luck.""",5
Methadone,Pain,"""I am amazed at the effectiveness of methadone. I&#039;ve spent the last three years in serious back pain due to a bad disc which ultimately led to back surgery. We tried everything under the sun. I can&#039;t believe how good I feel....no ups and downs, no weird &quot;highs&quot; (which I hated the most about pain medicines) and no more feeling like I&#039;m losing my mind. I&#039;ve never felt so strongly about posting a review before. I am ever grateful to the creators of this pain medicine.""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I am 16 and have had about a 4 year history with ovarian cysts. I had Skyla placed last month during a light period. 30 minutes before the procedure, I took 800 mg ibuprofen and 2 Midol. I did experience pain during the procedure but only for a moment during the placement prep to place the IUD. Immediately, I felt sore. An hour later, I started feeling irritable but it passed after 30 mins. 2 days after insertion, I started experiencing severe cramps and it continued for the rest of the month every 2-3 days. For the past week and a half, I&#039;ve been having extremely painful cramps. Last week I went back to my gyno for cramps and I got an internal ultrasound. It showed a large cyst on my ovary but the doc basically said it was normal. He prescribed me 550 mg naproxen for the cramping. But overall, Skyla has been effective.""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Lexapro is great. I started when my panic attacks and depression made me unable to function at all and I was too afraid to leave my house. My thoughts would race and I was just a mess. I started on 5mg for a week which was like nothing but then upped to 10mg and after 3 weeks I was beginning to feel less anxious and more stable. After 6 weeks I&#039;d say I felt normal. I&#039;m going to try come off them after being on them for a year and a half. I haven&#039;t had a panic attack in over a year so for panic disorder they work fantastically well. I&#039;ve experienced no side effects with this drug.""",7
Bupropion,Depression,"""Just started Wellbutrin 1 week ago.  Was taking Lexparo 20 mg for about 6  years.  About 6 months ago the depression grew in a negative way.  I cut back to 10 mg a day.... BAD IDEA for me.  Hopelessness, despair, tiredness were just a few of the negative kickbacks.  Asked doctor to try Wellbutrin.  After one week my appetite is finally, after 47 years, under control.  I read that this medicine was good long term; only problem is the loud ringing in ears and this weird feeling in my head.  I&#039;m hoping the weird head feeling will go away, but other than that so far so good.  Despaired feeling is gone, but I am a little emotional. """,5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien for about 3 years. I have Anxiety disorder and have had trouble getting to sleep as long as I remember. I worked night shifts because it was easier. After I had kids, I had to become a day person! I had terrible nights of falling asleep at 3-4 am after tossing and turning. I used Benadryl for several years and one night it turned on me, I had anxiety attacks, muscle spasm &amp; ridgidity. My doctor gave me Lexapro, because I had depression at that time as well. I hated it and how numb I always felt. Then he prescribed Ambien. I cut the pill in half. It doesnt knock me out, it just turns my brain to slow and sleepy. I sleep like a baby. I wake very happy and alert. No more depression either.""",0
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""I have suffered with anxiety and panic for years, since about 14 y/o. I have tried several different benzodiazepines over the years but always go back to diazepam. I can use it for both preventing a panic attack before a specific situation, or use it to relieve one once it&#039;s started. You can even take it the night before a specific event for nervous insomnia. Diazepam calms me down without tiredness or feeling spaced out.""",7
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I don&#039;t care what most say, this is the best pain reliever I have ever had for my chronic pain. No other medicine works like this does. Only problems I ever had with it was the one time I ran out a day early and I had some withdrawals so yes it will give you withdrawals but if you are taking the right amount and doing what you are supposed to, and have a good doctor, that won&#039;t be a problem. This is a great drug for people that follow directions and are in severe pain.  After a year or so, you will get too used to it, that&#039;s when you go on something else for a week or bare the pain and take ibuprofen and then when the week is up it will work again.  That&#039;s how great this drug is, it works again in a few days!""",9
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I have to be in bed by 8 pm to get a full nights sleep for work early the next morning.  I&#039;ve never been able to fall asleep that early on my own, but Lunesta has been awesome.  It does not make me sleepy, but 15 minutes after taking it I lay down and just go to sleep.  At first I found I would wake up 4 or 5 hours later, but my doctor recommended taking melatonin with Lunesta.  Doing this (I take the 10mg time release melatonin) I sleep all night, easily wake up with the alarm clock, have no bad taste in my mouth, and am not groggy at all.  I do not take it on nights where I do not have to get up early the next day.""",0
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""I have been prescribed Gabapentin for insomnia. For the last 2 years I have taken it nightly at bedtime 2000mg + 12.5 mg zolpidem ER + .25 mg of alprazolam.  I find the zolpidem + alprazolam put me to sleep and the gabapentin keep me there...... most of the time.  I feel as though I have forgotten how to &quot;fall&quot; asleep, but now knock myself out.  After taking this handful of pills nightly at 9 PM, I can be awake at 2 am or 4 am. It has been a lot of drugs for a long period of time.  Since the drugs &quot;labeled&quot; use is for nerve pain, which I didn&#039;t have, I worry that the neuroma in my foot that developed 15 months ago might be related.  Neuroma, foot injections, foot surgery .. Pain unresolved
How effective do you think it is?""",0
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""I took Propranolol for over a year,  for Anxiety. Worked brilliantly!

I&#039;ve seen a lot of bad reviews here,  saying it doesn&#039;t work and it annoys me because people clearly don&#039;t understand exactly what the Propranolol does and how it works... 

Propranolol does NOT take away Anxiety as in the psychological side to it, like feeling nervous. It is a medication that slows down the heart. So if you get fast heart/palpitations due to Anxiety, that is what it is used. It&#039;s not a benzo that will affect your mood, it just slows your heart down.""",7
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My son was diagnosed ADHD in 4th grade, he&#039;s now in 7th. Since that time we&#039;ve tried many medications. We finally settled on Metadate, and it worked great, but we kept having to up the dosage, until he&#039;s now on 60mg. The doctor recommended adding Intuniv to the Metadate. He was cranky and irritable the first week, but now at week 3 and 2mg dosage, the crankiness seems to be getting better. What I have seen with Intuniv is that he&#039;s very difficult to get up in the mornings. But on a good note, if I miss the Metadate medication, his behavior is still pretty good. He&#039;s not bouncing all over the house. When he&#039;s on both the medications, he&#039;s doing really good. I do have hopes to eventually get him off the stimulant all together.""",1
Orlistat,Obesity,"""Very effective but couldn&#039;t handle all the visits to the loo. After too many visits to the toilet I cut down to one a day. I ate two virtually fat free meals for breakfast and lunch and then took just one pill with my evening meal. Stopped me snacking completely, fear of accidents! steady weight loss approximately 1kg per week. Very good but stock up on the toilet roll. Taking one pill with just my evening meal means that my toilet trips are evening/night. This suited my lifestyle much better as don&#039;t have the kind of job where I can be dashing off every five minutes!""",2
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Started taking Adipex-P 4 weeks ago. Cons: Constipation and really bad bouts of Insomnia - better as time has gone on. Do not take with a blood pressure pill/water pill - you will feel like crap and your heart will try to burst through your ribcage.
Pros:  Lost 31 pounds.  17 pounds - yes 17 pounds in 1 week though I do attribute that to the Adipex-P   Blood Pressure/water pill. I found I could not take both at the same time or on the same day so I stopped taking the blood pressure pill. My blood pressure is down to where it should be. 
Working out 4-5 times a week. 4-5 miles of cardio per workout plus weights. Probably cut my daily calorie intake by half.

I plan on taking the pill for a max of 3 months so by summer I should be off the pill but still have a more active life.""",2
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve had zero side effects.  The fist change I noticed is my mood dramatically improved. My friends, family &amp; coworkers have all noticed the change. For the first time in forever I feel normal. I&#039;m not mad at the world. I wake up happy. As for my weight loss it&#039;s taken several months but I finally feel I&#039;m on a roll. I&#039;m only down 25lbs but in the last couple months the scales are doing down. Food it not a priority in my life anymore. As I sit here there is a king sized Kit Kat sitting on my nightstand where it&#039;s been for weeks since my roommate gave it to me. That never would be the cast in the past. I have more energy and have even lost a pants size. I will do whatever it takes to stay on this medicine.""",3
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had nexplanon inserted 8.4.2013 and apart from bleeding for a month straight to start with it&#039;s been okay. I Just like the fact I know I&#039;m always safe from getting pregnant. However over the 3 years sometimes I will come on my period like normal then other times I won&#039;t have a period for 4 months it&#039;s very hit and miss. At the moment I&#039;ve been on my period for 2 months straight with 2days off in between. I am thinking about having it taken out now as my period just doesn&#039;t seem to be going away. I didn&#039;t gain any weight or have any other side affects.

Sertraline,Depression,"""I have been suffering from depression after losing the love of my life.. The situation was unreal I could not understand my thoughts , I failed Uni , and couldn&#039;t even concentrate in any activities . 
I had to seek for help to continue to have a life , my Dr. Prescribed Zoloft same day I was  the old me , I could not believe I was scared to admit I was not weak but I was sick , best decision I ever made , I got my life back , using for 3 weeks only .do yourself a favour ask your Doctors about it . Good Luck""",5
Tramadol,Depression,"""I have been on just about every antidepressant you can name. They started giving me bad side effects like constipation so I had to stop taking them. For about two years I could hardly get out of bed in the morning, I was suffering from severe depression and had absolutly no motivation to do anything. I had gotten tennis elbow and the doc put me on tramadol. Within a couple days not only did it help with the pain but I started feeling my depression lifting as well as my motivation. I told the doctor it was working great for my depression so he kept me on it. I take 150 mg a day. I no longer sleep all day and have even decided to go back to school. It helps with not only my motivation and depression it helps me concentrate. I love it! """,5
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Today is my 7th day of the 15 day trial and I&#039;ve lost 4 pounds. I will refill my prescription as soon as I can (despite the cost). I&#039;m looking forward to posting more about my results as time goes by. Start 209lbs current 205lbs 5&#039;4&quot; 31 year old female. I&#039;ve never been &quot;skinny&quot; but after quitting smoking I gained 20lbs, tearing my ACL, MCL and spraning my LCL I gained another 15. I also managed to get pregnant 3 months post-op and gained 70 pounds during my pregnancy (I wasn&#039;t allowed to workout while pregnant after my surgery). I had lost 56 pounds of the 105lbs I had gained but haven&#039;t lost a pound in a year and a half. I get monster craving and I can&#039;t say no to food. Belviq helps me say no. 0 side effects for me.""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the insert about a month ago after a friend recommended it. Everything was fine for the first week and a half then I started getting migraines. I have a pretty high pain tolerance so it shocked me when I couldn&#039;t function because of a headache. Not thinking anything of it, the head aches began to happen more and more often now I get them everyday. It&#039;s gotten to a point where pain medications won&#039;t work and I have to sleep the pain off. Not only that but I have been having crazy mood swings and depressive episodes. As well as I&#039;m gaining weight and my face is breaking out. I am not a happy camper when it comes to Nexplanon I&#039;d much rather use condoms or become a teen mom then to keep this implant in my arm . I do not recommend this""",8
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""Works well in combination with an SSRI. I stopped Buspar due to drowsiness and immediate weight gain. I experienced increased appetite and wanted to eat constantly. 
I was diagnosed with Adult Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity. I currently take Adderall, low dose Wellbutrin XL, and low dose Prozac. 
The Prozac and Wellbutrin XL assist in alleviating depressive symptoms during the winter months. 
Everyone is unique. Talk to your doctor; follow their advice.""",7
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Having started a business in a high stress field, I experienced episodes of stress and anxiety that interfered with my sleep, ability to concentrate and that began to manifest physically with chest pains, headaches, etc.

The first 10 days were a nightmare.  I had a terrible spike in my anxiety and stress levels.  I considered bailing on the medication and even my business, but my wife pressed me to continue.  After 10 days I started to see an improvement.  The anxiety improved and so did my mood.  By day 14 or so I was transformed.  I completely stopped having anxious thoughts.  My entire demeanor changed.  I am now like Teflon- stress does not stick around for more than a few minutes.  This medicine was a lifesaver and my business is great.""",7
Strattera,ADHD,"""Stratterra is incredible. I began taking it in 5th grade, after Adderall and Ritalin both failed me. I heard from my doctor that Strattera works for a less percentage of people than stimulants (like Adderall and Ritalin), but if you have had trouble with stimulants, Stratterra is worth a try. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and both Adderall and Ritalin caused me to have spontaneous anxiety attacks. While Strattera does not treat my anxiety, it does not increase it. Strattera will NOT work automatically, like stimulants. It took about a month for my Strattera to work, and in that month I experienced a lot of nausea, drowsiness and headaches. I encourage you to ask your doctor about Strattera if nothing else has worked.""",1
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m 37 and I suffer from pcos. I have been battening cystic acne since I was 25. I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on meds, topical creams, different dermatologists and even laser treatments that have become costly. Doxy is a quick fix and as long as you&#039;re on it, it will work. However, coming off the meds you&#039;re skin will start to purge so be prepared. I&#039;ve been mixing the right vitamins, cutting out dairy, eating GF, and keeping my diet rich in lots of green leafy veggies and high protein. I also have to exercise at least 3 times a week. Taking probiotics is also extremely important. Don&#039;t exfoliate too much and try to keep your cleansing regime simple. Hope this helps.""",4
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I&#039;m happy to read so many others who have been helped by this medication.  I&#039;ve been taking it for over a year now, each time my pain doctor increases it a bit (I&#039;m now taking 50 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night).  Unfortunately, I really don&#039;t notice that much pain relief from this medication.   I take Norco for &quot;breakthrough pain&quot; and it seems as though I need to take that 4 times a day along with this for relief of my back pain.""",9
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got it insterted April 2015 and it is now October. I haven&#039;t had any crazy side effects at all. My first period was a bit heavy but not bad. My next few were very light. But I suddenly stopped getting a period until now in October and it&#039;s quite normal- not heavy or light. I have always been sensitive but I feel like it might actually be giving me mood swings. Besides that everything is perfectly normal and I don&#039;t see any reason why anyone would not recommend it.""",8
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I take 40 mg of Latuda nightly with a titration dose of 25-75 mg Lamogotrine (Lamictal) for bipolar I. Within a day of taking it, my mood brightened, I was able to wake up in the morning without malaise, and experienced a loss of appetite. I much prefer this to Depakote and Wellbutrin. I was not compliant with the Depakote due to the side effects of a huge appetite and the fact that it made me feel like a zombie. After a manic episode, I needed to recommit to compliance again, but abruptly stopped taking Depakote and Risperdone (prescribed right after manic episode) due to side effects. After a couple of weeks of no medicines, the Latuda/Lamotrigine cocktail made life so much brighter.""",6
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I thought Belviq was the answer to my prayers.  I was on it for a week everything was going great other than a headache the first few days and then boom urinary tract infection. So I got some antibiotics, stopped the Belviq to fully have time to heal.  I restarted the Belviq several days later and again urinary issues severe ones such as bladder leakage, burning, pain, frequent urination.  Terrible.  I have been back off Belviq now for a day and the symptoms have decreased tremendously.  I hope they go away completely.""",3
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started on Saxenda on February 14, 2017. My weight was 295 lbs, I am 6&#039;3&quot; tall and 55 years of age. Today it is March 8, 2017. When I began using this product I experienced some sickness, itching and I was very tired however the appetite suppression effect was immediate. As such, I modified my diet to include more healthy and &quot;weight loss friendly&quot; foods. I also upped my doses every 4 days instead of every week as recommended. I am very pleased to announce today that all of the symptoms except the itching have resolved themselves. I have been on a full, 3.0 dose since March 2nd. At this time I am 281.2 lbs,  which is down about 14 pounds. My goal is a 50 pound weight reduction and I feel that with Saxenda this is a very realistic goal.""",2
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I have been suffering with abominable head/back pain (pain lasting around the clock for up to 4-5 days straight) as well as abdominal pains with constant vomiting and no ability to lead a normal life including having to take a leave of absence from my job.  In &#039;11 alone I was hospitalized 4 times 4 months in a row. One stay I was vomiting blood and passing it in my stool. In the ER Dilaudid IV gave me relief. Was given it every 2 hours. Zofran and Dilaudid helped at home too. My doctor put me on Vicodin inlieu of Dilaudid saying the latter was habit forming. Since then no relief of pains. Dilaudid 4mg helped great. Miracle medicine.""",9
Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,"""3rd month, 3rd post
I am happy to report that the getting 1-2 pimples every single day, HAS STOPPED! I am so happy. I originally started this pill to get less break outs/nopregnancy. I went from getting 2-3 pimples before my cycle break out to getting 2-3 EVERY day the moment I started this pill. Has been very difficult, but accepted that the pill is a shock to your syndrome and it takes months for your body to adjust, to just stick it out. I am on my 2nd wk of month 3 and I have only gotten ONE new pimple. All the red marks left on my face from the constant breakouts, are almost completely gone. Not to mention, I have always considered myself very emotionally aware/stable, but this pill has mellowed me out to a whole new level. Love it!""",4
Tretinoin,Acne,"""When my dermatologist first gave me the cream and I began using it my acne cleared up and I had great skin, but once I kept using it on my break outs I noticed them becoming worse and worse. My skin became so dry, red/ puffy, and peely that there was nothing to do, I felt helpless, I couldn&#039;t even apply my moisturizer because it made my skin burn. But my derm assured me it was part of the process, come to find out I was actually getting minor chemical burns which currently cover my entire chin/ under my nose area. In the beginning I thought this cream was my savor and my ticket to clear skin but now my skin is worse then ever and I regret ever using it.""",4
Aczone,Acne,"""I have tried so many acne medications, and this one was like every other one that didn&#039;t work. I believe that Aczone permanently damaged my skin. I have an olive skin tone and I would rarely get burned. After using this medication my whole body, not just my face, is now extremely sensitive to the sun. If I am outside for about 15 minutes without sunscreen I will burn. The best thing that I did for my acne was to get on birth control and get enough sleep.""",4
Pristiq,Anxiety,"""I just started today and wasn&#039;t expecting to see any difference as most antidepressant take weeks to see any difference. Today about 2 hrs after taking I felt so tired. Being at work didn&#039;t help. I have read many of the other comments and am hoping it&#039;s a miracle drug like a lot have said. I take Seroquel for sleeping that I think will help as a lot of others say Pristiq interferes with sleeping. Hopefully I will be back to write again and hopefully there will only be positive results to write about.""",7
Qsymia,Obesity,"""In the beginning I did get headaches they lasted maybe about 3 wks. I have been on Qsymia for almost 6 wks. I lost 13 lbs the first 3.5 wks. I haven&#039;t lost a lb since. I don&#039;t understand, I have actually gained 2 of those back. it did not curb my appetite at all. I would say it did give me a little more energy. I did not get constipated as I hear you get however it does make soda taste horrible. I don&#039;t know how I am feeling about this. I have been walking and exercising and changed the way I eat so I just thought I would have seen more of a result especially for the money. I am going to try one more month and see what happens.""",2
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I am on day 4 taking the medication. The only side effect I had was on day 1. The best way to describe it is that fuzzy a little sick to your stomach feeling you have when you step off a roller coaster. It only lasted the first day and was very tolerable. If you eat a tiny protein snack every 3 hours I think it helps or In my case prevents the nausea. So I&#039;m on day 4 and I&#039;m down 3 and a half pounds. I am struggling with weight gain due to menopause and my doctor thought contrave could be the help I need. I am also doing Leslie Sansone&#039;s Miracle Miles in home walking program. I am so hopeful that this works!! I will update in a few weeks.""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""I remember a half a year ago reading these reviews and I was very eager to not feeling worthless anymore. The first month was bleh. Had bad diarrhea but slept great for once. But over time feelings of worthlessness and being overly fearful faded away. I started to slowly be able to get out of bed in the night (third shift) and be excited to go to work and engage people. Sadly, over time the anxiety seemed to have gotten worse. My sleeping also went back to its normal habits. They upped it to 40mg to no avail. Now I&#039;m off cold turkey and the depression is hitting harder than it has ever. Wish I could get back on it. It was a literal life saver.""",5
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I take dilaudid for a severe kidney stone condition.  I take the pills at home (4mg), although I start by cutting them in half and only take 2mg to start.  If 2mg don&#039;t help, I take the other half of the pill for a total of 4mg.  I take the dilaudid in combination with MS Contin.  Like many others have said, I have tried many other pain medications and dilaudid is the ONLY thing that helps me with my pain.  Morphine does not help (it makes me very sick - although the long acting MS Contin is ok).

When the pills are not able to control my pain, or after surgery I take IV dilaudid, and this is the best pain medication.  There have been times I&#039;ve been curled in a ball in tears the pain has been so bad and this works instantly.""",9
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I have Lupus, arthritis and had most of my back crushed in a auto accident. Opana is the ONLY pain medication that has relieved a majority of my pain throughout the day. I take 40mg every 8 hours and I am able to walk around and do things I couldn&#039;t do before when I was on the patches and all the other drugs I tried. Opana is the best long term medication that keeps working without fail for me.""",9
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I tried this medication for insomnia.  I had been taking Restoril 30 mg to help me sleep but it had stopped working as well. My doctor gave me samples of Belsomra to try and said I needed to start at 10 mg but it probably wouldn&#039;t work until I titrated up to 20 mg.  I had the worst night I&#039;ve had in a long time after taking this. I became confused and upset.  I began crying and became dizzy and felt as though I couldn&#039;t breathe. I was terrified to go to sleep. I apparently did fall asleep at some point after lying awake trying to keep from going to sleep due to fear. I had horrible dreams.  Never taking this again. Worst night I can remember in a long long time. I&#039;ve felt horrible all day, groggy, and nervous.""",0
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I have been on 10mg for 6 weeks. Very little nausea at first and some headaches but nothing ibuprofen did not take away. I did not notice much at first, then maybe 3-4 weeks I noticed a little relief from frustration and sad feelings. I can&#039;t find a job and have gained a good amount of weight over the past year so I am having self esteem issues anyway but over the past week I am a mess. I am sad and cry a lot. I cannot focus and feel cloudy in my thoughts. I am very irritable and short tempered. I will try to see about increasing the dose. It seems like a slow progression but I am hopeful a higher dose may help.""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have lost 88 pounds in 10 months. I had some drowsiness and increased sweating at first but improved within a few weeks.. A small price to pay for the overall improvement in my quality of life. I believe the effectiveness depends upon the underlying reason for obesity. naltrexone lowers cravings and improves addictive behavior. My problem was the compulsion to binge eat high calorie foods. I don&#039;t know how effective it would be on obesity for other underlying reasons, which may explain why it works for some and not for others. My life has improved and I can do things I have been unable to do in years. Very pleased!""",2
Methadone,Pain,"""This drug has changed my life. I never thought I could get my life back but Methadone allowed me too. I can do everyday activities that I wasn&#039;t able to do before. I am able to focus on everything around me now instead of the pain. I have not had any bad side effects. The only thing that I noticed was when my dose is increased for the first 2 days I am a little sleepier at the end of the day but after those 2 days I&#039;m back to normal. It&#039;s so good to be able to say that now, I&#039;m normal. This has been my miracle drug, the people who say bad things about this are the people that don&#039;t know anything about the drug.""",9
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I have a C-5/6/7 fusion with a titianium cage. Confirmed nerve damage at C-7 via nerve conduction study. Like most of you I&#039;ve been on many types of pain medications. It is different for each and so is the tolerence. I am finally stable taking hydromorphone 8mg. and OxyContin 30 mg. I take them &quot;backwards&quot; meaning the hydromorphoe is for &quot;base&quot; pain and the OxyContin is taken at night so I can make it through the entire sleep cycle without waking up due to pain. I do not have breakthrough pain on this regiment and it is less expensive. Also please have your testosterone levels checked since these medications can lower it. I take Testim; a gel, that brings my levels back to normal. Testosterone affects your heart, mood and other functions.""",9
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I was started on 30 mg a month ago and within past week have been upped to 45 mg. Seems to help me sleep better than I was. I just hope the effects don&#039;t stop and it continues to help with my sleep as well as my depression. I have been a ginny pig for over 20 years to these psych meds. I have not noticed any  of the horrific side effects people are experiencing. Also have to determine if side effects out weigh the benefit. No hangover effect and no tiredness throughout day! It has done wonders for me thus far.""",0
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I had HORRIBLE cystic acne on my chin - i&#039;m talking 20 huge cystic pimples on my chin at any given time - no amount of makeup could cover it up. It was causing me major concern and depression. 

My Derm put me on Accutane that worked fairly well (aside from bloody noses and extremely dry skin) but as soon as I finished Accutane, my acne came back with a vengeance. 

So I went back to my Dermatologist and she put me on Spironolactone. She  told me the pills could take up to 2-3 months to take any effect BUT here&#039;s the thing: it worked STRAIGHT away! I&#039;m telling you - I took 2 pills! One on Sunday then another on Monday and by Tuesday my pimples were almost gone! I honestly think this is some sort of miracle pill...it&#039;s changed my life.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""well I started with phentermine 37.5 mg June 28 2016...it is now July 26 2016  and im down 23 pounds .....start weight 302 I actually did a weigh in today and I was 279... I was skeptical first cause I herd about all the side affects but I really wanted to lose weight and im glad I trusted my self the only side effects I have had is dry mouth and constipation my legs are a little jittery every now and then but I sleep really good at night.....I walk/run 3 miles every day and I already lost 5 % of body fat every person body is different .....I will highly recommend this pill""",3
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve seen 11 sleep docs in 4 states for my 16 yr old-sleep probs and don&#039;t have a diagnosis yet. The closest said the part of my brain that tells me when to be awake or asleep isn&#039;t working properly. He nailed it, thus my self-diagnosis of sleep-wake amalgamation. I&#039;ve taken 19 meds, eg Ambien, Provigil, Klonopin, Rozerem, Vyvanse, Lunesta, Trazodone, Gabapentin, Mirtazapine &amp; OTCs like melatonin &amp; valerian. Of all, Belsomra is the only 1 that doesn&#039;t leave me groggy, druggy or sleepless, although a few were very beneficial and I still use with Belsomra. With Bel., I get more REM sleep and feel much sharper. My only disappointments are the slow sleep latency &amp; very slow increase in deep sleep, likely due to Klonopin&#039;s GABAAR downregulation.""",0
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I had severe anxiety, agoraphobia. I am on Xanax for about 3-4 month started with 0.25mg morning and 0.25mg at night and now on 0.50mg two times a day and feel great. No panic and my life is much easy. The world is more familiar and I can go anywhere. It&#039;s like I have wings now. I will try to leave the medication in future but for now I accept my situation because I like the feeling of living.

As an anxious I was afraid of death same as I was afraid of life. Now, I LIVE.""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Methylphenidate (Ritalin), which is always understood to denote IMMEDIATE-RELEASE, is a miracle medication w/practically zero side effects.I mean true Schedule 2 stimulant narcotic methylphenidate ..not Adderall, not Dexedine,not dextroamphetamine, not atomoxetine. My weight, brain, overall health, wellness, &amp; relationships are healthier on rigorous doses of methylphenidate (Immediate-Release plus Ritalin LA or Immediate-Release plus Concerta); however, pharmacies have to understand that  the generic must be the true actual commercially available exact product in every aspect as brand.  """,1
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Update: 4 weeks and 6 kg down (28kg to go), just started full dose with no side affects, no lingering affects. Hunger back slightly but still cannot eat large portions, feel full all the time, sugar cravings continue to be significantly reduced. Interesting bonus is not feeling like drinking alcohol-one/two glass of wine is enough for me now, if at all. Just got my first script filled @ $387 AUS for one month at the pharmacy, ouch. My private health insurance (Medibank Private) covers some - will provide update of how much next post after I submit the claim. Tip: you still need to eat well (reduced calories) and more often, and if you feel full STOP eating!! Listen to your body...""",2
Nortriptyline,Pain,"""I take 25mg of nortriptyline at bedtime. I have taken it for 3 weeks. I toss and turn at night and sleep about 3 hours for 2 nights, then on the 3rd night, I am able to sleep 9 or so hours because of lack of sleep previously.  It has helped my neck pain considerably, but about 10 days ago, I began getting pain in both my knees and hips, which makes it even more difficult to sleep now.  At first, I believed it was because of the treadmill, but I stopped after 2 days using it to heal my knees and hips, but they are still hurting. Also, I am experiencing memory loss. I am 68 years old.""",9
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""I am 43 years old, dropped out of high school, had many bad relationships, many bad decisions, and could never finish 1 thing when I started it, could never be organized, could never remember things when first told, always lost things or misplaced them, tripped over my own feet, and was never good at keeping appointments, I would forget about them. I have been on Adderall for 4 years, had my ups and downs with it, have had to change the dose some, go off of it on my days off, because it got to where it wasn&#039;t working as well, and if I medicated myself, I took to much, or not enough. I do notice a BIG difference in the generic, even though they say its the same. Adderall XR has worked wonders for me, and has changed my life.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Completely stopped all panic and anxiety that antidepressants never helped nor any kind of benzo. After two months I was able to wean off of my antidepressants and happily zero anxiety or panic. I started in July after a bad try for a month of Concerta. Been on it since now month 7. Tried a few dosages but 80 is what works best for me. Since stopping the antidepressant end of August, I have lost 25 pounds!!! It helps control binge eating that I did out of frustration of my disorder.... I now make clearer healthier food choices and drink a ton of water. You must be careful with the caffeine intake and may possibly need something to help you settle in to sleep at night. I should but choose to only take one med currently.""",1
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Ambien was a great for me. I suffer from spine damage and pain wakes me. Sleep studies found I got 2 hrs of REM sleep. Ambien made this 5 and 6 hrs REM sleep. From this I cut my pain meds in half. My life got better and I went back to work. Medicine is not designed for long term use, yet I had to. This was only way I could sleep. 
I started with depression problems. Dr gave other medicines and it only made me worse. Ask for a sleep medicine change to Lunesta. In a week my depression was gone.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I just started lamictal, after tapering off of topamax. Topamax did nothing for me. I have disorder 2 in which I am more manic. I&#039;ve been on it 3 weeks and so far I have been episode free, which is good for me considering I am a rapid cycler. I&#039;ve done a lot of research on lamictal and it appears to meet my needs the most. And it&#039;s weight neutral. (Topamax never made me lose wight either). Also it doesn&#039;t halt your emotions like say lithium, where you are neither nor sad you&#039;re just emotionless. I hate that. Lamictal was a great choice for me so far so good!""",6
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was prescribed with lamictal about 3 months ago, and I do have to say that I have had a very positive experience with stabilizing my mood swings. Within the first month of me taking it, I have lost 10 pounds and I do think it was a factor in my sudden weight loss. I do wish that it did help a bit more with my anxiety but that wasn&#039;t my main issue when I decided to see a doctor. Other than the anxiety, lamictal is fantastic. I do recommend this product for BDP and I hope it helps you.""",6
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve tried many other non-addictive medications and none of them helped my anxiety the way Xanax does. After several other medications, (and hesitation on my part) my doctor finally prescribed me Xanax 1 mg 2-3 times daily depending on my level of anxiety that day. I ended up breaking most of the pills in half and only taking 0.5 mg usually 3x a day, and find it relieves my anxiety without the level of sleepiness a whole mg gives me. I usually only take a whole pill if I feel a panic attack coming on. But, I&#039;ll take the mild drowsiness any day over the level of constant anxiety I had prior to starting the drug, and a couple cups of coffee usually does me good. I can definitely tell when a dose starts to wear off though, some withdrawal.""",7
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been on and off Lexapro for 6 years. I got off it twice thinking I was completely fine and then a year later (both times getting off) my anxiety came back tenfold. I am back on Lexapro now and happier than ever. Many people are scared of being on medicine or asking for help but we are all made differently and some of us need medicines to live a fuller, more amazing life. Lexapro has enabled me to accomplish things I didn&#039;t see possible and allowed me to relax and enjoy life more! Everyone has their own definition as anxiety but to me if your anxiety is interfering with your every day life then try everything you can to remediate it. I have tried yoga, vitamins/ other homeopathic remedies and as much as I wished they worked, they didn&#039;t.""",7
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I think Opana ER is a GREAT pain medication. On a 1-10 pain scale, I went from a 6 with the MS-Contin to a 3 with the Opana.  I get more done around the house (I can prep, cook, and clean, as I could only do 1 of those things continuously with the MS-Contin) so it does its job in that respect, but it has never lasted 12 hours. It seems to wear off in 8 hours on the dot.  And when it wears off, you don&#039;t just hurt, you feel like total crap.  Usually you don&#039;t feel like that as soon as a pain medication wears off but with this, you do.  If I get my dosage raised to 3 instead of 2 a day so I don&#039;t have to go through the yucky stage, I can&#039;t help but wonder how I&#039;m going to feel when I come off as I have only been on it for a month.""",9
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am 40. I was diagnosed bipolar 15 years ago. My mania manifests itself as aggression/rage. My rage has been a problem since I was young. My violent outbursts consisted of me punching myself, bashing my head against walls and other horrifically embarrassing and dangerous actions. I was extremely verbally abusive to anyone unfortunate enough to be near me during my rages. I have been on many meds throughout my life. Every benzo. Mellaril. Thorazine. Every SSRI. Depakote. Lithium. NOTHING curbed my rage. In fact - SSRI meds INTENSIFIED my rage. 10 years ago, my psychiatrist put me on 20mg of Abilify. Within 4 days - I felt like I could finally breathe. My rage literally disappeared. But I don&#039;t feel &quot;zombie-ish&quot; like with other meds.""",6
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking wellbutrin 150 SR twice a day for 3 months now, I started with 150mg the first month and 300mg from the second month. It hasn&#039;t really helped me with depression like Prozac and Lexapro did. I told my doctor that I didn&#039;t want to gain weight like I did on those drugs so he prescribed me bupropion. I have more energy, I&#039;ve lost weight, but the depression is still there.""",5
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was really scared about taking quetiapine as I had read all the horror stories, particularly around weight gain.
Firstly, I would say everyone is different and this may work for you. For me it has been a godsend.    I haven&#039;t felt this good ....ever....it has made such a difference to my life.    Far better than any antidepressants for bipolar depression. As far as weight gain is concerned, before taking quetiapine (75 mg) I was binge eating 3 days out of 5. This has stopped entirely, I have no desire to binge eat...like flicking a switch. So my advice is to try it remember 77% of patients don&#039;t gain weight on this drug.   Btw I am also on  lamictal 200mg. (I felt more hungry on mirtazapine)""",6
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""Hello all, 3rd time writing. Just got back from the Dr. I did my 1st dose on June 19, weighed 266lb, followed the dosing schedule, lost 11 lbs in 17 days.  This drug is awesome and no side effects at all.  Very happy with the results. Will continue until I reach my goal of at losing another 30 pounds.. My ideal weight for my height is 180 lbs but I would look sick and wouldn&#039;t go that far down. I was once 220 lbs and looked decent. With this drug, it will be a breeze. Also, I walk about 8 km a day and I barely eat. Sugar cravings are gone finally and need to pump out all the crap out of my liver until it functions back a 100%, then the weight will melt off. Happier than I can explain...to all you who are feeling discouraged, be patient.""",3
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I have been taking Lexapro for more than four years at 10mg-20mg.  It has been great at reducing mood swings, anxiety, and sadness. I have not noticed reduced effectiveness, however, my doc did move me up to 20mg because I was still experiencing pms mood swings and irritability.  I also have mild to severe depression.  There are only 3 side effects I have experienced and that is reduced libido, yawning, and inorgasmia. Which I feel I can handle as long as I&#039;m happy and positive. I had tried Zoloft before and it didn&#039;t make me happier it just made me jittery and jumpy all the time and I couldn&#039;t relax.  So, Lexapro has definitely been the answer for me.""",5
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m 19 years old and I&#039;ve had anxiety since I was a kid. When my family would sing happy birthday to me, I would have a panic attack and cry. I cried every day my kindergarden year. My anxiety got worse over the years but my parents are those types that don&#039;t believe in medication and mental disorders. This year, since being an adult and being able to make my own decisions, I decided to see a therapist. They started me out on 5mg lexapro. The first month was like heaven. I could hold conversations with strangers, go to restaurants and not have a panic attack trying to order food, and so on. After that first month the medicine just stopped working. I was tired and sick all the time and it made me have horrible bursts of anger. Don&#039;t take this!!""",7
Celexa,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on this medicine for about a month and I&#039;m really encouraged. I&#039;ve struggled with depression on and off now since I reached puberty (I&#039;m now 37).  My childhood was great and I could never figure out why I struggled with depression, low self-esteem, racing thoughts, etc.  I&#039;ve been to counseling at various times and tried therapy including CBT.  While these have been helpful to a degree, I never seemed to be able to shake the feeling of angst, gloomy thoughts, etc.  I know it is still very early but I really feel great. I don&#039;t seem to be having the depressing thoughts and my outlook is so much more positive.  For the first couple of weeks I experienced loose stools, mild hot flashes in the morning but they seem to have subsided as well.""",5
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Xanax since 2003 and I absolutely love it. I have a social anxiety disorder it makes me extremely nervous to be around large groups of people, even my friends. When I don&#039;t have my Xanax, I&#039;m no fun to be around and I have high levels of anxiety. Not fun. Bottom line, Xanax really has saved my life. There were times when I was suicidal and without it, I may not be here. I would recommend it to anyone who needs it.""",7
Effexor XR,Depression,"""I started Effexor XR about a year ago. Within a month I developed an excessive sweating condition, which my family, friends, and others noticed and commented on. Many of my new blouses got discolored sweat stains on the neck, which would not be removed by pre-treating or washing. I could no longer exercise without having a major debilitating sweat, which would take at least 20 minutes to recover from.  I started Cymbalta yesterday, and tonight I was able to walk for 1/2 hour with my husband, with only normal sweat.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking phentermine 37.5 today. I have read a lot of comments here, but I don&#039;t think I have read of anyone else taking topiramine with the phen. 
This is my first time on either drug and am pretty impressed so far. I have had little to no appetite today and have had to force myself to eat. I am diabetic, so I am no stranger to carrying a bottle of water. Any suggestions to help me get the most out of phen would be greatly appreciated.""",3
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""Have been on Buspar for a few months, and I like it a lot! It has made severe and paralyzing anxiety lift to a manageable level, even while taking a low dosage of 10 mg daily. My Dr. told me that I can increase the dosage, since in taking so little it doesn&#039;t rid me of anxiety completely (no med can). But I noticed that when I upped my dose my appetite came back more than I would have liked. Essentially, I think it works to strengthen my SSRI (sertraline); and I did have dizziness when I first started and felt pretty bad, but that&#039;s common for anti-anxieties and usually goes away as your body gets used to it. I do still find however after I take my morning dose (usually) with coffee I do feel a bit woozy but it usually wears off quickly.""",7
Opana ER,Pain,"""I just started this medication a few days ago and I am on 10 mg twice per day..I would have to say it works very well on my neck and back pain and my nauseating migraines which all result from a car accident and I&#039;m only 23 years old. I luckily have a very nice understanding doctor and know what I&#039;m going through and he has never turned me down when I&#039;ve needed an increase or change in meds.""",9
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I have to say after all the other medicines I&#039;ve tried I&#039;m not sure why this was the last resort. This was the only medicine that worked for my cystic acne caused by my PCOS. I&#039;ve tried birth control antibiotics topical treatments you name it. Nothing beside this has really worked for me I a on 100 mg once a day and this has been my savior. Although i found it took a good month to see oil reduction. Only con was irregular periods but after 5 months it straightened out.""",4
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""Took 5mg. Dizziness after I initially started taking, that vanished but occasionally cropped up once in a while. Felt pretty good. Happier. Thoughts that I would normally worry about still came to me, but I was able to think about them and dismiss them, not obsess over them ALL day. Some months later though I began becoming extremely emotional. I cried all the time, became so depressed getting dressed and brushing my teeth was a huge struggle; was paranoid, wanted to hurt myself, had crazy thoughts. I would sob at the drop of a hat, which ISN&#039;T like me at all. Took months of confusion, emptiness, anger, and loneliness to figure out it was the Buspar. Loved it in the beginning, but unfortunately it was not for me!""",7
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I had a scary adverse reaction with Ativan. I was given 1 mg in the hospital orally for the very bad anxiety I was having. About an hour and a half later I began getting the most strangest, scariest hallucinations. Both visual and sensory. I don&#039;t know if this was an allergic reaction but I never had this problem with any other benzodiazepine. Please be cautious with Ativan in particular, because it altered the functioning of my brain (it wore off the next day).""",7

Bupropion,Depression,"""I have been on antidepressants for 5 yrs and several of them made me gain weight and I always had this feeling of shakiness.  My Dr switched me to a combo of Wellbutrin XL and Prozac 20mg.  I&#039;ve lost like 15 pounds and feel way better!!  Made such a huge difference for me in how I feel about myself.  I agree with others that have posted, I only take brand name meds.  I&#039;ve heard so many issues with how generics don&#039;t work as well.  To me, to feel better and finally be able to enjoy life, it is worth it.  My two cents...""",5
Stadol,Pain,"""I was having serial migraines and ALL other types of headaches for many years after a bad car accident. They got so bad I&#039;d start screaming from pain. In emergency room a wonderful doctor gave me stadol nasal spray. In less than ten minutes, my pain was under control, I had an appetite, could move around or rest as needed. The worst side effects were an awful aftertaste  and snacking. I refrained from driving, but the screaming headaches would have done that to me anyway. God bless the doc that took a chance that I wasn&#039;t just another addict.  Thanks to him I did not kill myself in despair; it gave me a chance to find a decent pain doc, get blocked nerves, botoxed tmj, dropped stadol, no addiction!!""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 22, have never been pregnant, and had my Mirena inserted ~3 weeks ago. Other than some slight cramping during and some moderately worse cramping later that day and for a few days after (nothing pain killers can&#039;t handle) it&#039;s been great!  I used to have really heavy, really painful periods (which is why I went with Mirena over the paraguard) and though I was supposed to get my period the week after they put it in I haven&#039;t had anything but super light, almost non-existent spotting.""",8
Solodyn,Acne,"""Worst drug ever-- I am usually not allergic to any drug but I Just took it for 2 days and have the worst body pain, muscle soreness, feverishness. The list of long term side effects from this drug is appalling. As a scientist and cancer biologist I usually take extra caution as to what drugs I consume but the side effects of this drug is scary and having experienced it first hand I am stopping it just after two days of use. My face is still dry and has acne and I am close to 40. Hopefully a topical cream will help- definitely not solodyn!""",4
Intuniv,ADHD,"""I am 39 and have dealt with my ADD for all my life. May of 2012 the Dr. started me out on 1mg, after a week, I could tell a difference.  Like a filing cabinet in my brain. However, I was VERY tired. So I decided to take at night. (I&#039;ve always had a hard time shutting my brain off to sleep)  Next week she upped me 2 mg. After a few days, I started to notice I focus more...GREAT!!, and I was sleeping better!!  She then put me on 3 mg. I couldn&#039;t tolerate it! I started getting hot flashes and thought I was going to pass out!  I couldn&#039;t sit out in the sun, I had to stay in. So she lowered me back to 2mg. A year later and its the best decision I have ever made.  My brain is calm, I am focused and sleep like a bear!""",1
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""Being a severe epileptic I&#039;ve had insomnia for years as well as some thyroid probs that lead to increased BP/HR.  I originally tried Lunesta /ambien and they caused pretty nasty side effects (doing stuff and not remembering etc) plus they stopped working pretty quickly.  My PCP   eventually placed me on 30mg tablet of Temazepam (from my understanding though not many drs in the US like to prescribe this med due to possible dependency issues etc). While it&#039;s only supposed to be used on a short term basis I&#039;ve actually been taking it for about a year almost every night (sometimes I don&#039;t),  when I don&#039;t take it i haven&#039;t noticed any unpleasant side effects.  It just slowly puts me while watching TV to a great  restful sleep. Def recommend!!""",0
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I was suffering from major cystic acne on my cheeks, forehead and chin. Everyone started commenting on the horrible situation of my face :( I started feeling frustrated. I used to feel ashamed going outside. Then my doctor prescribed me doxycycline tablet (1/day), clyndamine gel. It took one month to start showing its effects. And believe me ..my skin started becoming real clear. Right now my chin and forehead are completely clear and cheeks are having light acne marks which are fading day by day .Now the people who used to comment on my acnes they are admiring my clear face :) :)""",4
Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was put on Zyprexa after my dad got murdered.  It worked ok for that medicated Zombie feel. I took up to 20mg day.

Been in bed for 8+months with horrific post withdrawal symptoms. Never had heart problems before Zyprexa! Now I have afib and sinus tachycardia, and TD, involuntary muscle spasms are so painful! People notice when I stick my tongue out, biting it hours a day, sexy. Its killing me slowly as Eli Lilly makes $12Mil a day killing! I use Melatonin for sleep, is Z even approved for sleep?

Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on Qysmia for a week. I&#039;m 42, f, 5&#039;0 @160lbs. Tried trainers, diets, lipo, nutritionists, weight watchers, etc and have only seen my weight steadily increase towards my family&#039;s inevitable diabetic history.

I&#039;ve had the mild headache the first 2 days although I&#039;m not sure how much of it was real and how much of it was me being overly sensitive to the long list of side effects. I drank more water and felt better.  Definitely didn&#039;t sleep well but took a mild homepathetic remedy for that and that&#039;s improved. Felt a little dizzy a few times but nothing that would deter me. I&#039;d rather lose this weight than fret over being dizzy. I&#039;m down 3.2lbs in 7 days. I&#039;ll update as I go. Good luck everyone and drink plenty of water!""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This is so awesome reading everyone&#039;s reviews. These are real reviews to me. You read other diet adds, they are not real. I started in late August, 28 2013. I have lost a total of 15lbs so far! Looking to lose more. I was near the 200 lb mark. It&#039;s been like that since I had my last child in 2005. All this time I had been working out, I saw no changes. I needed a change because I have insulin resistance. That is scary to me. Diabetes runs in my family both parents. I love this pill!. It&#039;s amazing how much energy I feel. I did feel jittery when taking at first and not feel hungry but I ate anyways. I watch what I eat. Insomnia and dry mouth. Drink lots of water. I just want to feel better about myself. """,3
Accutane,Acne,"""Amazing! I understand when people say they tried everything. I didn&#039;t have severe acne but persistent and regular plus it didn&#039;t help that I was a real squeezer and probably made whole situation worse. And I already get anxious about social situations so the skin problem added to that! 
I was able to go on a low dose, 20mg which I was scared wouldn&#039;t be enough but this stuff is strong! Can&#039;t complain about the dry skin as how else is it going to work? The whole idea is to make you less oily. Lips were very dry and gross at the start and whole layers were peeling off but that isn&#039;t so bad now. Have been through about 10 lip balms already! But that&#039;s it really. Sometimes feel a little tired but that could also not be Accutane.""",4
Bupropion,Depression,"""I have been taking Wellbutrin XL for so many years that I can&#039;t remember when I started it.  It has been the only med that has really worked for me.  I tried generic bupropion and cannot take it because it upsets my stomach and does not have the same effect on my mood or emotions.  

Now I am in a quandry.  In March I go on Medicare and was already told that Medicare will not pay for Wellbutrin.  I don&#039;t know what to do.  For about 2 years I have been getting it through the manufacturer&#039;s discount program, but once I go on Medicare, I can&#039;t get it through the manufacturer either.  This really stinks!  I hope someone has a solution because I cannot afford $1,500/month for a prescription!""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am one and done on this medication.  I was at work and got so sick I had to leave and I felt as if I was having the world&#039;s worst hangover all day and into the night. It is totally not worth feeling so horrible. Even today as I write this, my stomach is still upset and I don&#039;t feel back to normal. All I can say is Contrave is one very powerful medication and I definitely experienced severe side effects.  I am going the old fashioned route for my weight loss and chock this up to live and learn.  There are no shortcuts in life.""",2
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""Have suffered from bouts of severe anxiety over the last few years that would leave me bedridden, suicidal, unable to work or eat. Tried Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro, Cymbalta, Luvox and honestly thought nothing would ever work for me. All made me worse. Psych doctor wanted to try Effexor XR but I was worried about the withdrawing from it - after trying everything else I finally agreed. Has taken a month to feel a difference. I&#039;m enjoying things again, not chewed up by horrible anxiety, I&#039;m actually HAPPY?! 1st month on it was so challenging - very low, anxious, exhausted, nauseous. But now no side effects. I feel like a light&#039;s gone on. Like I am getting my life back. I could sob with relief. Truly believed I&#039;d never get better, but here I am.""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 19 and I&#039;ve been on Concerta since age 7 . It has helped me no doubt. I have never had any problems as people say above stomach problems I have never had any. The only thing is I keep eating the complete opposite of everyone else. I usually take it at 9am everyday and I notice it wearing of around 6pm. Yesterday I didn&#039;t take because I tried something. I&#039;m currently working night shift usually it&#039;s been out of my system hours before starting work. So tonight I took it 9pm even though now it&#039;s 4.30am and I&#039;ve been awake since 7am yesterday I neither show or feel any signs of being tired, drained both physically or mentally. This medication has been nothing but a Success for me.""",1
Pristiq,Depression,"""Dr put me on pristiq because I was having a bad time dealing with the loss of a loved one. It&#039;s my first medication and have been on it for 9 months, Although it has relieved my mild anxiety I have decided that this or any other medication isnt for me.The weight gain has pprobably been the worst and only side effect for me, after 3 months I piled on 10kgs. On my pharmacists advice I have been lowering my dose on alternate days and am now on my third day without taking it. I feel like im a little tipsy/heavy headed by the end of the day and that&#039;s all so far but is bareable and I still manage to go about my day as normal, hopefully this doesn&#039;t last long. I have never experienced brain zaps either""",5
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""My first kidney stone.  Very painful.  Went to ER since I didn&#039;t know what was happening.  Cat scan = kidney stone ~2mm.  I wasn&#039;t going to die and it would pass.

They 1st gave me IV morphine.  That took the pain down about 20% to a manageable but still very painful level for about 10 minutes then it jumped back up as if I&#039;d had nothing.

They then gave me Dilaudid saying it worked on different receptors.  In 2 minutes the pain dropped about 75% and stayed down for about 4 hours until it wore off.

Dilaudid seems to work differently than morphine. A great and powerful medication.""",9
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I came off antibiotics for acne when my dermatologist prescribed me tretinoin cream .025%. He told me to wash my face with benzoyl peroxide topical wash 2x a day, apply differin in the morning, &amp; apply the tretinoin at night. He said coming off the antibiotics would initially cause me to break out but that it&#039;d get better.

It&#039;s been 4 months &amp; the complete opposite has happened. The 1st 2 months I had almost no acne for the 1st time in my life. My skin was still dry, as it&#039;s always been, but using moisturizer helped with that. However, the last 4-6 weeks I&#039;ve been suffering terribly from acne on my chin &amp; cheeks. To make it worse, the area around the zits is extremely dry. I guess ill just keep using the cream, hopefully this is temporary.""",4
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I love this medication, I&#039;ve been on it for years and it does double duty for me- Both as an allergy medication and Anxiety. While I&#039;ve built up a tolerance to if over the years, I love that it&#039;s non-addictive and calms my mind enough that I can relax. While it doesn&#039;t make me sleepy, it does allow me to be calm and after an episode of high anxiety, this often does lead me to sleep. While not for everyone, I personally love it.""",7
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I have been using this for just over 2 weeks now and lost 6 pounds. The side effects are there but not really bad%u2026.unless you eat the wrong things! It has helped me already see which food are more fatty than others. I have had no accidents etc but then I know if I go off having a curry/Chinese then yes, I will. I want to loose another 2 stone in 3 months and my doctor is positive I can. Just remember, it%u2019s not a miracle drug you must work with it by cutting down on fatty foods and portions as well as exercising. Good luck.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m taking this medicicattion because of an odd amount of weight gain relating to hypothyroidism and that in relation to my first and only pregnancy. 
Ive went from 135lbs to 169lbs in less than a year. I stressed this problem and was recommended Phentermine. 
I&#039;ve lost about 10lbs since taking it a month ago. I eat half of my portion sizes. I consume lighter, healthier foods. More energy. 
Downsides to this new medication though are bad dry mouth in the afternoon. My heart feels like its going to burst out of my chest depending on emotions. And sleeping! I&#039;m usually up till 12, 2, 3 o&#039;clock in the morning sometimes. Everyday I&#039;m awake inside but outside I don&#039;t look so good. 
Going to continue another two months and see what happens.""",3
Focalin,ADHD,"""I am 20 years old and I&#039;ve been taking focalin for a year now. I have been on every ADHD medication under the sun since I was in second grade and this is the only  medication that helped me get on track right away. The only adverse side effects I experience are a faster heart rate (most ADHD meds do that) and trouble sleeping. If you are having trouble sleeping on this drug here&#039;s what you do and here&#039;s what I did: prior to now, I was taking my medication at 11am or 10am. Often I would spend nights awake and panicky just begging for sleep to come. This is a simple fix. Just wake yourself up at like 6am every day to take it and you shouldn&#039;t have any problem sleeping. That&#039;s what I did and I sleep very soundly.""",1
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I&#039;m in UK and had to buy this myself, my last hope before considering surgery. I&#039;ve been taking 0.6mg daily for 5 days and began doing 20 minutes on my exercise bike each morning. I&#039;ve lost 6lbs already. I&#039;m eating healthy small meals and have no hunger at all. It&#039;s amazing. To keep the cost down for me I am going to see how long I can get benefit from 0.6mg. I&#039;m highly motivated and I think this drug is finally telling my brain that I can do this!""",2
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Well I&#039;m coming upon my one year anniversary of using Belviq and l have lost nearly 50 lbs.  I lost faster in the beginning and now I am down to maybe 1-3 lbs a week.  I have lost slowly due to being disabled and I can&#039;t walk without my walker because of a botched bilateral knee and hip replacement a little over a year ago.  Exercising is mostly out for me.  I&#039;m 62 and 5&#039;6. The Belviq is not keeping me as full as it did in the beginning but I don&#039;t want to stop it because I&#039;m afraid I will stop losing all together.""",3
Liletta,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had this IUD since April 2017. The initial issue was bleeding for about a week but other problems in the long run for me are the mood swings, feeling deep depression, and the slight weight gain. Even after eating right &amp; working out I wasn&#039;t able to lose any weight while having this IUD in me unlike when I didn&#039;t have it in me I could lose weight fast. I do have periods but they aren&#039;t as heavy and very irregular. For me this IUD does it&#039;s job. I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant at all while on it. It&#039;s good to get if you aren&#039;t trying to get pregnant of course but be sure to do your research in advance &amp; review others side affects to it before getting it which I wish I did but didn&#039;t. If I did, I wouldn&#039;t have got it and I plan to remove asap""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I wanted the Nexplanon to be the answer because I love the convenience of it. The insertion was painfree and it was covered by my insurance (I paid a $30 co-pay. I know girls who pay $25 per MONTH to get the pill). I waited patiently to stop bleeding but it would always come back after a month, three, six. I feel bloated often but not too bad with cramps but I didn&#039;t suffer very bad cramps before insertion. It may have effected my moods/depression but I have had several hard life events in the past few years so it would be hard for me to judge. Ultimately, I got it out because of the weight gain. About 130 when inserted (2 yrs ago), 178 when removed today! It is convenient but there are definite side effects and downsides.""",8
MS Contin,Pain,"""I have degenerative disc disease and had spinal fusion and stenosis surgery in my lower back. For years I have been on Norco 7.5mg/325 (1 pill 4x a day as needed.) and for the most part that took care of my pain. Roughly the past year my dr decided to reduce the Norco by half and added MS Contin. 15mg 1 pill twice a  day. It didn&#039;t help much. For me it takes the MS Contin three hours for me to notice any difference and it only helps for about six hours leaving three hours before I can take another. He upped it to 30mg in the morning and 15mg at night. Still not seeing anything different. This Friday I am going to ask him if I can just go back on the Norco at my old regiment. It seemed to work better for me then these extended release meds.""",9
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I just started the medication this week. I&#039;ve had three shots so far.  I was really worried about the needles but you honestly don&#039;t feel a thing.  I didn&#039;t even feel a pinch when I did the injection.   I do feel a bit tired. I have a very dull headache.     I do have a little bit of  nausea.   I have been injecting in my upper thigh where there&#039;s plenty of fat. (Lol).   My appetite  has decreased so I have to keep an eye on my emotional eating.  I am a former gastric bypass patient  trying to lose the last 30 pounds. The first hundred was easy. So far so good.""",2
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I definitely recommend the Mirena as an option for birth control. I decided to get it my senior year in high school because I have goals to achieve and I did not want any babies stopping that. I started off with pills but I realized my lifestyle did not fit that. If you do not want to worry about taking a pill on time EVERYDAY, and worry about the possibilities of you becoming pregnant, get the Mirena. It didn&#039;t hurt much and now all I&#039;m doing is spotting. Take this from a teenager, it DOES work.""",8
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I was on Vyvanse for ADD. I started off at 30mg and enjoyed the ability to better focus my attention on tasks and it worked as an appetite suppressant. I increased it to 50mg and that is when my eyes started to become blurry. I decreased it back down to 30mg and I still had blurry eyes at times so I discontinued using the medicine. While using the medicine, I took my Vyvanse in the morning early and then 50mg of Zoloft in the early afternoon. If I took both pills at the same time in the morning I become agitated and felt like EVERYTHING was important and found it hard to concentrate. It was a really weird rush of emotions. If it doesn&rsquo;t make your eyes blurry or make you agitated this is an awesome drug. It started working within a week.""",1
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started a diet exactly 32 days ago. I went completely cold turkey, no soda, no sugar, sweets, or fast food. I worked out on my WII every night for the first week and got bored. Then I got a gym membership and I work out 1-1.5 hours every night. I ate almost every 2-3 hours fruits and veggies. I lost 15.4 pounds the first month on my own. I had a follow up with my doctor and asked him about Adipex. He seemed pleased with my question and wrote me a prescription for 30 days. I have now been on the pill for 3 days only, I went from eating 5-6 times a day and drinking 4-5 bottles of water and my 1-1.5 hour workout to now drinking 6-8 bottles a day. Already lost 4 lbs!""",3
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""My doctor suggested gabapentin for my leg cramps/restless legs and insomnia.  I was unable to sit for any period of time without my legs causing discomfort and would have very painful leg cramps.  I would find it hard to get to sleep and would wake up at 2 or 3 am every night. I have been taking gabapentin for a month and am very pleased....I have not experienced any of the severe symptoms that have been described by others.""",0
Sertraline,Depression,"""I&#039;m giving this an 8 because I have only been taking for a few weeks. I am taking 25mg/day along with up to 100mg of Hydroxizine every 6 hours for anxiety. Doc told me it would take about 4-6 weeks for Sertraline to really kick in but, let me tell you, I have already noticed a HUGE difference! Much calmer, clear minded, able to focus, excited to be alive. I just got sober a few weeks ago, so these meds are a Godsend since my body is readjusting to normality. So far, 2 thumbs way up!

Side effects I&#039;ve noticed: HUGE appetite, random small headaches, and lower sex drive. All of these could be from too much caffeine, too little exercise, my body readjusting to sobriety..........or a multitude of other things. Can&#039;t pinpoint them to the meds.""",5
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""Started taking Temazepam when my parents were sick. I have had chronic insomnia for 20 years before resorting to asking the doctor for some help, as I was taking extremely high doses of Gravol/Dramamine and was lucky to fall asleep at 5 am only to have to get up at 6 am.  Started with some blue pill that left a horrible aftertaste, then Ativan  but that didn&#039;t work.  Finally started with Temazepam at night.  Take it a couple hours before bed, and then fall asleep almost as soon as my head hits the pillow. I will never come off this drug, I couldn&#039;t possibly return to crippling insomnia.""",0
Valium,Anxiety,"""I am a newbie to Valium. Just took my first dose today, 10 mg. The doctor prescribed it for the acute anxiety attacks I have once in a while. I have generalized anxiety disorder mixed with bipolar disorder. I take Pristiq for the anxiety and it has helped but it doesn&#039;t cover everything. When I&#039;m anxious I cannot go outside and become bedridden. I am also on 70mg of Vyvanse for ADD and it took the doctor some time to be convinced of the benefits of taking a benzo. You know, the whole upper/downer concern. I took my Valium in the evening when the Vyvanse was wearing off. It worked wonders. It kicked in 15 minutes upon taking it. the only side effect is that I feel a little wobbly when standing. But the fact that I am calm makes up for it""",7
Differin,Acne,"""DO NOT use differin. As a result of using this lotion I developed a horrible red rash on my neck and face. 2.5 months later I am still have to apply hydrocortisone cream twice a day to keep it at bay and can&#039;t use any nice foundation or makeup. I have read several other reviews where it has happened to people and spoken to other GP&#039;s who have said they wouldn&#039;t prescribe it. 

IT IS NOT WORTH IT! Try anything else, but don&#039;t use this product.""",4
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on this medication only one week but am cautiously very optimistic. Prior to this I was on citalopram but still feeling very low and sleeping poorly, feeling like I needed to be in bed 12-16 hours a day. Now I am waking naturally after only 8 hours sleep and finding it much easier to concentrate at work. I can hardly believe it is working so quickly but I feel so much better. I&#039;ve had no side effects.""",5
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""Qysmia is working for me!! On for 3 mths did trial for 2 weeks. My insurance covered it because my BMI was over the range so the cost per mth for me was 30.00. So I&#039;m almost done with my mths. And go back to my doctor for check up. As of now I lost 18lbs. I feel so much better. It really does boost your metabolism. You do get the tingling in your hands and feet sometimes. You get a little moody and sometimes you can&#039;t sleep. Most of all its helping me lose weight I haven&#039;t been able to lose in years! That&#039;s very important to me. Also drink lots of water no soda or alcohol. I also watched my bread and junk food. Try to cut carbs as much as you can. Try to walk around the block every night. Exercise with this really helps alot! Good luck!  %u263A""",3
Ibuprofen,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) since 1999 for headaches and body pains. I sometimes take this with the prescription medication Maxalt (which treats migraines) I&#039;ve have REALLY bad headaches and migraines since I was in grade school and took Tylenol until when into my late 20&#039;s. I then started taking the regular 2 tablet dose, 400 mg. I HAVE on occasion upped the dosage (not on doctors instruction) to 600mg if the 400mg dosage isn&#039;t effective and the pain doesn&#039;t not subside within 30-45 minutes.""",9
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Belsomra for about 2 months now; but, not every night. My doctor took me off Ambien, which had worked GREAT for me with no side effects. I&#039;ve found that Belsomra works sometimes and sometimes not. If I eat anything at all an hour or two before going to bed, (and I&#039;m talking a very light snack), this med will NOT put me to sleep. I lie there for hours in a kind of twilight sleep, not being able to totally drift off. The next day it feels as if I haven&#039;t slept at all. I cannot count on this med to help me sleep. It does work on some nights and I have not been able to find the trigger that makes it work some nights and others not? I&#039;m going to try it for a while longer; but, so far it&#039;s not worth the high price!""",0
Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication is saving my life!  It really stabilizes my mood.  Before I started taking carbamazepine I would experience horribly crippling depression in the afternoons combined with very strong urges to self medicate with alcohol or narcotics.  Now I feel about the same all day, never really up and never really down.  I have no conflicts taking it with Suboxone. I have only noticed two side effects: nausea, taking it with food fixes that, and increased sleep.  I sleep longer than I did before and wake up feeling tired.  Actually it helps me to sleep through the night, which isn&#039;t all bad.  After I get up, take my other medicines, and have some coffee I am ready to face the day.  Note: I was previously misdiagnosed with major depression.""",6
Restoril,Insomnia,"""I tried this for insomnia after trying many different medications. It does work great for helping you fall asleep and staying asleep, but it does have side effects. Being a hypnotic it does cause you to do things in your sleep you might not remember when you wake up. For example: After taking it one night, I woke up the next morning to find myself soaking wet. I had a bottle of water on my chest. I had poured the water all over myself during the night and had no memory of it. This is just me though, some people have no problems with this medication. Overall, it works great for helping you fall asleep.""",0
Xanax,Anxiety,"""Xanax simply stops to work when taken too long on a daily basis. At that point, one reaches &quot;tolerance,&quot; and the medication is simply no longer effective at that dose. Many psychiatrists tend to keep prescribing Xanax and other benzodiazepines at this point (strong, addictive tranquilizers that lead to dementia and Alzheimer&#039;s) as maintenance meds. It is then up to you to realize how bad they are and wean yourself off them, going through years and years of dangerous withdrawal. The best solution is don&#039;t even start! XANAX: NOT EVEN ONE!""",7
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""37-year old female, 10 mgs about 4.30 AM; prescribed three days ago; used for ADD-like symptoms associated with Asperger&#039;s.  I feel more comfortable in my skin, focus lasts for more than 12 hours. Only problems: cannot eat apples without getting spacey for about a half-an-hour (used to eat them to boost focus and energy when my Strattera wore off after four hours), and have to really fight to focus during monthly cycle.  However, no other complaints, yet.  Also on Lisinopril (20 mgs) for blood-pressure and Metoprolol (betamblocker to reduce betawaves for anxiety; 25 mgs).  Concerta XR was good too and had the same effect.""",1
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""I have been on about 100 mg. of dexedrine for over 20 years and it always worked great until a few years ago, when my drug company stopped sending me the TEVA generic. I never had problems with generics before but the Activis brand did nothing for me. I was told that TEVA was made by the same drug manufacturer that makes the name brand so I payed extra for the name brand and that does not appear to be working either. I have been told that TEVA no longer makes dexedrine so I am not sure what I should do. Also, I was told that the FDA no longer allows doses over 60 mg. but I am sure that is true. It could be my insurance company does not want to pay for more than a standard dose.""",1
Ritalin,ADHD,"""Ritalin is great . I ve been taking it for 6 months now after being diagnosed with adhd. Now I can focus on my school work and stay alerted when last year I was sleeping the whole day during school and could learn anything. Marks of course have jumped from C to A as I can focus and stop doing stupid mistakes in tests that I didn t realize I was doing nor could spot due to the lack of patience. Impulses have been reduced also""",1
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""Have had mild anxiety issues since early 20s. Spiralled downwards with increasing anxiety after an injury that made me unable to work. Tried mirtazapine with temporary relief, but got worse again after a few weeks and before starting Lexapro anxiety was so bad that I was unable to work and that leaving the house resulted in panic attacks. Started Lexapro on a Friday. Felt absolutely terrible until Tuesday. Nauseous (relief from Reglan though), heavy anxiety, buzzing feeling in body. Then improvement came very gradually and very slowly for the next weeks. On week 8 now and honestly feel great. The crippling anxiety that was present 24/7 is gone and only on occasions do I feel it, only much milder and never in the form of panic attacks.""",7
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Saxenda did not work for me. I actually gained weight and was never not hungry. I am an overweight type 1 1/2 diabetic. Hoping for a miracle, I starting using Saxenda. Right from the  beginning, it did nothing to curb my hunger. 

So after a $500 co-pay, $200 doctor visit and issues with my deductible, a 90-day supply cost me $ 1,900. Seems like a serious cash cow for all involved especially people who never experienced obesity.""",3
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I was prescribed Exalgo by my physician about 3 weeks ago. I&#039;ve been a long term pain management patient, and we decided to make a change. I had been taking Avinza. I am not certain that the mgs are equal, but the Exalgo doesn&#039;t come close to helping as much as the Avinza. I take as directed, each medicine is to be taken before bedtime, and since I have switched to Exalgo, there have been many sleepless nights. Maybe the dosage is not enough. This will be discussed with my physician. """,9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started phentermine 5/13/15 ... 37.5mg Starting weight was 167lbs. I had my first baby 8 months ago and gained a whopping 63 pounds! My doctor suggested this pill and so far I love it! I weighed myself today for the first time since I started and I lost 14 lbs in just 8 days!! I am beyond excited and have been able to notice change which gives me some hope to get back to normal! The first day I took it it was a crazy feeling and I didn&#039;t think I liked it, I was also up till about 4:30 am that morning. But now a week later the only side effect I have is slight dry mouth and I&#039;ve had a couple small headaches. I love how it completely takes away my appetite which makes me not crave any junk food and I&#039;m able to eat healthy small portions!!!""",3
Lexapro,Depression,"""I took this medicine for both my depression and anxiety.

In the first week I had a really dry mouth and was lightheaded and couldn&#039;t really concentrate on anything but that passed.

It just about cured my anxiety; I can&#039;t even express how grateful I am. While being on it (after the initial 6 wk period), the only time I really suffered from anxiety was in situations where any NORMAL person would start getting anxious and it never escalated to the point of tears and having to lock myself in a bathroom.

As for the depression, it helped a lot but after 18 months of being on the maximum dose, I guess my body has built up a tolerance to it and I now need to change over to something else. I&#039;ve gone back to crying every day. Was great while it lasted.""",5
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve been taking Ambien for many years. The first year, I was prescribed 10 mg nightly. I had experienced a &quot;deep sleep&quot; and through the entire night. For the first time in my life, I didn&#039;t feel exhausted the next day. Then my dosage was changed to 5 mg, which was tough! My tolerance to the higher dose made it not work. My Dr. gave me something different to substitute while my body adjusted. It&#039;s not been 2 years, that I&#039;ve been taking the 5 mg. I also take Adderall XR @ 20 mg daily and 20 mg of Prozac. During the last 6 months, I&#039;ve had difficulty with memory. Being able to recall things I read, appointment times, things people had said to me. I am 52 years old, and I understand that comes with age. But has anyone had similar problems?""",0
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""After 5 full days on Belviq I can assure you this is going to be a wildly successful product. It has made sticking to a diet of reduced portions and healthier foods EASY. I can now eat half what I used to and feel completely full. It has eliminated my compulsion to snack when watching tv or a movie and the results are already noticeable. I started Belviq weighing 227 and as of this morning I was at 222 (after only 5 days). I&#039;m not starving myself, just eating the amount I should have been eating for the last decade. The only side effects I have noticed thus far is being able to fall asleep faster and having a more upbeat and positive attitude in general.""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the Implanon Implant put in October 2009 and have felt it has been the best choice for me. My period is irregular, I never know when I&#039;m going to get it but so far that is the worst part I have experienced, my weight has stayed steady and have had no pregnancy scares, since my period has become irregular and sometimes spaced out by 5-6 weeks I will sometimes take a pregnancy test to make sure it is indeed working and so far so good, thumbs up from me.""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I started Lexapro 10 mg while my mother was terminally ill - very high stress period. It was like a miracle. Totally relaxed me and got me through a rough period. I only experienced two side effects - weight gain (10 lbs) and zero sex drive. Because of the weight gain, I decided to wean myself off a few months after my mother passed away with no problems at all. Then, six months later began suffering the worst anxiety with severe panic attacks. I immediately got back on Lexapro and will try to combat the weight gain with diet and exercise. It was a good drug for me.""",7
Citalopram,Depression,"""I am currently taking 30mg of this drug for depression and have found it to be very beneficial.  The first few weeks are very difficult and it can be tricky to find the correct dosage.  As this is the second incidence of depression I now need to take the drug now for 1.5-2 years, and so far it has been 1.25 years, although after that I will probably then remain on a maintenance dose.  The negative aspects that I have experienced are difficulty with orgasm, slightly drier mouth and eyes, and gas, but compared to the effects of the illness of depression, these are minor issues, and I now lead a happy and fulfilling life thanks to this drug.""",5
Armodafinil,ADHD,"""I take this with other meds for my ADD and mania. Now my sentences come together and thought processes, I&#039;m not always fighting to stay awake, I can concentrate on single subjects. Waking up in the morning from a night of Antipsychotic medication that knocks you out isn&#039;t a problem anymore. Would give it a 10 but it looses efficacy over time - moved from 250 mg. AM dose to 250 mg as soon as I awake and another 125 mg 4 hours later. Otherwise I feel a crash without my 2nd half dose. Find a coupon, this is no cheap drug.""",1
Codeine,Pain,"""Had 4 wisdom teeth taken out this morning at 8:30am. My dentist prescribed some codeine for the pain. Having never taken codeine before, and the label reading take 1 or 2 pills for pain, I decided to take 2 around 12:30pm. WOW, these things take all of the pain away alright, however, for about 1 - 2 hours they made me very drowsy, out of it and I couldn&#039;t look at anything with a screen without it being blurry or me feeling dizzy. I was literally glued to my seat. Thought I was going to throw up at one point too.  Should probably only be used for chronic, unbearable pain - otherwise it is not worth the side effects. Still feeling a little woozy now at 10:00pm. Will stick to the softer stuff because it seems like I am really sensitive to it.""",9
Saxenda,Obesity,"""My problem was at 09:00 pm every night I would get an incredible uncontrollable cravings for snacks. On weekends, my brain would convince me that I had to reward my weeks work with a 12 case of beer. This medication has effectively eliminated cravings for munchies and beer with no problem. I had high blood pressure 160/100 at the beginning of March 2017. Over 6 weeks, I&rsquo;ve lost 8 Kg (17.6 lbs). My goal is to lose another 30 Kg (66 lbs). My blood pressure has dropped to 127/80. The only side effect for me was tiredness. I started out at .6 for the first week and on the second week tried 1.2, but felt really tired. I went back to .6 plus adding one additional tick of the pen each day. I&rsquo;m now on 2.4 and experience only mild tiredness.""",2
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I have been on this medication almost a year and have been experiencing a lot of symptoms which I have thought was due to benzodiazepine withdrawal.
I experience grogginess, fatigue, Lightheaded, horrible Anxiety, depression, palpitations, tremors, bad dreams, brain fog, cognitive issues, unable to concentrate, I had nausea 3 weeks, dizziness, feeling weird in and around my eyes, felt mental, No appetite, constipation , stomach issues, fear, Weakness etc
I&#039;m starting to wonder if visterel is causing this?!!!! 
I take 50mg at night before bed And a doctor said I could take another 50mg if I woke so I have been and now I&#039;m thinking all my issues are stemming from this junk! 
I had some issues prior to medication but nothing like this!""",7
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I started this medication when I was 45 years old and started back to college.  I never excelled in college in my younger years and actually made the Deans list after taking Vyvanse.  I am now almost sixty.  I really don&#039;t need it other than helping my golf game once in a while.  I just wanted to say that it is a great medication for keeping ones focus, however I did experience quite a bit of hair loss.  I only take 20mg.  I do take breaks on this medication and have noticed that my hair grows much thicker when I am off of it.  Just an FYI.""",1
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I had been prescribed Klonopin in the past to treat severe anxiety until my appointment with a psychiatrist who deemed that such an approach to my anxiety issues was heavy handed. He took me off of them and since then I&#039;ve been on Lexapro, Buspar, Seroquel, Zoloft, Pristiq, Paxil, Atarax all to little or no avail. I moved to a different area and got a new Psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The original course of treatment for that was Ativan 0.5mg three times daily. I was switched to Xanax 1mg twice a day as needed. A couple of months passed by without substantial improvement and I was bumped to Xanax 1mg 3x day Doctor decided Klonopin would be a better approach earlier today. So far so good.""",7
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I started Saxenda on 4/28/17 at the recommendation of my doctor for weight loss. I have kept at the 0.6mg dosage and will not increase weekly rather every 14 days or so. I am tired and weak, extremely thirsty, my appetite is non existent. I try stay within 800-1000 calories a day but some days are harder than other to reach this goal. I have found if I have any carbs it makes me extremely nauseous and dizzy, I can no longer tolerate dairy it makes very sick to my stomach and gives me a terrible stomach ache. Constipation comes and goes. But so far as of today 5/7/17 I am down 8.5 lbs. I mostly snack all day on healthy fruits and veggies and have a small salad with chicken as my &quot;big&quot; meal. I will add 30-45 mins of walking a few times a week.""",3
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started Dec. 15th 2012 and this has been my life saver! I am 5&#039;9 I was 252lbs when I weighed in. I couldn&#039;t believe it. I had never weighed that much. 
I used to be an athlete growing up and after 4 kids my metabolism slowed down to nothing. Within the 1st month I lost 22 lbs! I had lost 40lbs by month 3. Total I have lost 57lbs in 6 months. I have been allowed to take it continuously, but I personally tapered it off so I wouldn&#039;t become dependent on it. I still have a months worth of pills left over and I&#039;m still losing! I walk for exercise, but nothing major. Gum helps for dry mouth and I drink a ton of water and eat off a small salad plate.
My goal is 160lbs. I hope to reach that by August!""",3
Paroxetine,Depression,"""I had taken Paxil when I was younger and it worked wonders with my depression and social disorder. However, this time around it is different, but still better with than without. My husband has been on it for close to 5 years. He used to be so angry all the time about everything, this helped him. It helped us because I am a person who does not do well with yelling and arguing. He did try to stop a few months back and it was terrible because his aggressiveness and irritability was off the wall, scarey. His mood swings came on quick and he realized he was better off staying on the Paxil. We are both on 40 mg a day. """,5
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""Although this medicine does work as described its response time to panic outbreak is not fast. It takes about 45 minutes for the feeling of dread or mania to subside. To go further the feeling is still there but it blocks the mind from reacting irrationally to the racing thoughts. I gave this medicine an 8 not a 10 because of the reaction time. So far all medications in this class have made me tired. I like this one because I have had no side effects or cross interactions with other medications.""",7
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I have suffered major depression for many years and have taken almost every SSRI that has been on the market.  I recently slipped into a bout of very deep depression and was almost suicidal.  Cymbalta pulled me out of it.  I am very thankful for this medication because it brought ME back.  However, it was not working at 60mg a day so the doctor increased it to 120mg a day.  I realize that is a high dose but the benefits outweigh the risks by far in my situation.  I was in the deepest darkest depression for about 3 months and almost lost my job over it.  Cymbalta saved me... literally.""",5
Lidoderm,Pain,"""I have CHRONIC sacroiliac joint and coccyx pain that does not show up on MRI or X-ray and I&#039;ve used this patch for a little over 1 month with NO side effects whatsoever.  I do notice that it takes about 2 to 3 days to feel the &quot;full effect&quot; of the medication and I do notice the increase in pain if I skip a day.  Maximum pain for me WITH the patch is about a 2 and that&#039;s great.""",9
Aczone,Acne,"""Aczone is the best acne product to ever happen to me! I&#039;m 23 and have tried nearly everything from Accutane, oral acne medications, creams, cleansers, masques, etc. for the first time in nearly ten years I have clear skin! The difference is Aczone. I use it in the morning under makeup or without and it controls the oil and reduces inflammation. It drys out my skin but doesn&#039;t flake or peel.""",4
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Overall, in my experiences I have learned that in terms of extremes... the  Methylphenidates will turn you into an emotionless robot, hollow inside, socially avoidant person unable to experience life&#039;s pleasures. Nothing makes you happy, but at the same time,  nothing can make you sad. 
 
Whereas with the Amphetamines (like Adderall and lesser extent Vyvanse) you become an extremely emotional, almost volatile, person who can experience pleasures in an extreme way. You get so overjoyed by the little things but the smallest of pet peeves can really set you off. 

Vyvanse has been the best one for me. Just be aware of how you are treating those you love especially several months after starting. You may need a secondary med to balance mood.""",1
Copper,Birth Control,"""Hello. I thought it was important to wait before sharing my experience until I reached the 4 months mark since the recommended time frame to give your body time to adjust to the device is between 3 to 6 months. After 4 months my side effects have began improving with the amount of bleeding but not the length. See below my chart that I&#039;ve been keeping track of. I got the device August. I started recording in October. August &amp; September were the worst with extremely heavy bleeding. (My body was adjusting, then the heavy periods disappeared and became regular periods)
October - 5 days of spotting, 2 heavy periods, 1 light period. November - 4 days of spotting, 3 regular period, 1 light period. December - 5 days of spotting, 1 light period.""",8
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I had the Mirena put in 2 years ago. There are only 2 things I like about it.  One, it stays in for 5 years (unless you decide otherwise) and two, I don&#039;t bleed as heavy as I used to. Other than that I don&#039;t like it. I have severe cramping, horrible migraines the week before I start and the 5 days I&#039;m on my cycle, I also have extremely crazy mood swings. I am thrilled to have it removed in a few weeks.""",8
Percocet,Pain,"""I had back surgery (Laminectemy of L4, L5 and S4 , 8 inch titanium rod w/7 screws)in October 2006 plus I have severe Fibromyalgia and although Percocet makes me a little sleepy, this is the first time in 4 years that I feel relatively pain free. About 5 doctors were afraid of giving me anything stronger than regular Vicoden because of habit forming. Who cared if I couldn&#039;t walk or participate in activities. I finally found a doctor that was willing to help! Sometimes they give dogs more pallative care than humans. I should have gone to a vetenerian instead. """,9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have always been up and down with my weight, but never to the point where you look at yourself in the mirror and don&#039;t know who you are looking at any more. Well!!! I have reached that point where I said &quot;ENOUGH IS ENOUGH&quot; I tried working out and eating well, a personal trainer, fasting, pills, diets and a lot more. You name it, I tried it! Well 6 weeks ago I decided to give Adipex-P along with B12 &amp; Methionine Inositol Choline (MIC) Injections injections a try. Guess what? I have lost 26 pounds. I cant explain how amazing this feels... IT WORKS! The 1st week alone I lost 8 pounds and I didn&#039;t even work out. The only side effect I got is Dry mouth which is good b/c it keep you drinking water. Once you see it works you will keep going b/c you feel motivated. Good Luck :) &amp; GBU""",3
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for almost 6 years now. I&#039;m a 29 yr old female and I have tried it all. Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, Buspar,  Vistril and lots more!!! Valium was the only thing that worked wonders for me, an absolute life saver. My Dr started me off on 2mgs every 8 hrs. But that wasn&#039;t strong enough as my anxiety attacks are debilitating!! Now she has me on 5mg 3x a day, and I also take Abilify and an antidepressant.  This has saved me. I can drive and go out without feeling like I&#039;m gonna die.""",7
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""Was on Ambien and doing well and the doctor told me since I was over 65 I could not have it any longer.  Tried Trazadone, Rozarem and then Belsomra.  I got maybe 2-3 hours sleep on the Belsomra if that and the dreams were axe murderer vivid. I also developed leg weakness and found my insurance copay was over $100.00!  I finally am back on my Ambien and am sleeping my usual 8 hours with no hangover in the morning and no axe murderer dreams.  Am very disappointed in Belsomra as I had watched its&#039; development for awhile and had high hopes.""",0
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Last report was 10/29.  Been on saxenda 10 weeks - down 24lbs (goal is 28lbs), dose has stayed at 1.2.  Tried 1.8 for a day but felt nauseous. Before saxenda my cravings for bread, sweets and a glass of wine after work almost every day were awful.  Following my doctor&#039;s diet and using saxenda - cravings barely exist.  Only 1 glass of wine in 10 weeks and a few pieces of Halloween candy twice.  Before saxenda I would&#039;ve finished the bag.  I use miralax every other day and feel a little more tired than usual, but no major problems.  A bit afraid of what happens when I reach my goal soon, but the saxenda experience with little to no cravings has really made me think about my behavior and the triggers that make me want to eat for no reason.""",3
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I have always been up and down with my weight, but never to the point where you look at yourself in the mirror and don&#039;t know who you are looking at any more. Well!!!

Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had lifelong insomnia. My dad will tell you stories about all the nights he sat up rocking me because I didn&#039;t sleep. I&#039;ve tried every over the counter remedy from melatonin, to valerian root, to sleepy time tea, to benedryl, to calms forte... nothing works for longer than 3 days at most, and it still takes hours to fall asleep. I&#039;ve tried prescription sleep aids, and Lunesta has been by far the most useless of them all. It doesn&#039;t make me even a little bit sleepy. It does, however, leave the most foul taste in my mouth. It tastes like I&#039;ve been sucking on an old penny and chewing the white part of a grapefruit peel. And it doesn&#039;t go away with brushing or mouthwash, it&#039;s just in your saliva forever.""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on Contrave 3 weeks now. The first week I was so sleepy on the drive home, exhausted feeling. It&#039;s not as bad now, but I wake up not feeling completely rested.  I haven&#039;t lost much, and I do find the weigh in&#039;s everyday slightly discouraging. I haven&#039;t exercised much because I just haven&#039;t had the energy. Next week I&#039;ll try to incorporate that, and try to be even more strict on my diet.  Going to keep going...but as of right now, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s helping or not.""",2
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m rating 7 for now. I&#039;ll post again when I&#039;ve been on Belviq for 2 weeks. The first 3 days I had headaches almost all day long. After the third day the headaches stopped. I&#039;ve noticed that I have more body aches than usual and my energy is a lot less. I think these will level out. My weight when I started was 183.4. After 5 days I am at !83.2. I was on vacation 3 of those days, so I cheated a bit. I believe I would have lost more if I would have been at home. It&#039;s hard to diet when you are on vacation. I&#039;m just happy that I lost at all. Belviq does curb my appetite some. Mostly I don&#039;t eat as much when I eat and I feel full longer. Yesterday I forgot to eat lunch. I have low sugar and not supposed to skip meals. I am on 2 a daily.""",3
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""Nuvaring is effective in pregnancy prevention. However, the side effects were bad. The first month was fine with only one bad side effect (diarrhea) and I wasn&#039;t too sure if it was even from my birth control that month. It was never listed as a side effect. When I got my period it was light and lasted only about 2 1/2days. 2-3 months side effects started to kick in, more abdominal cramps, normal discharge, extreme bloating very often, nausea, and headaches. Along with these I became extremely irritant/very grumpy, major loss in appetite, and when I did eat the diarrhea would hit (severely). Eventually I had horrible back pain, and became very depressed and negatively impacted on my life.""",8
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking 300mg Wellbutrin for 6 months. I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects to Wellbutrin, so that&#039;s good, but the problem is I also haven&#039;t noticed much effect at all. I did notice that I don&#039;t hit my total low point almost ever now, but besides knocking out my worst feeling of depression, it hasn&#039;t done much. I still spend most of my time incredibly sad, I still feel so awful about myself that I have immense difficulty socializing and I still feel like anxiety is eating away at me. But I guess even if I&#039;m not happy, as long as I&#039;m not at my lowest point I&#039;ll be fine.""",5
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m terrified of medication.... Basically a phobia, I have severe panic attacks.... If your like me... Try this drug! Made me confident around anyone! Amazing drug for anyone with social anxiety or panic attacks! It helps me in every single aspect of my life. Work, relationships, in every way I was more confident and basically the person I always wanted to be. Confident! No anxiety holding me back! Still terrified of trying new medications but this is one drug I&#039;m so glad I took... And I still take when I feel like I need it. Oh and best part... I have no side effects! At all. I&#039;m the type of person who will panic over even a small side effect and stop taking a medication because of it.... But with this medicine I feel amazing.""",7
Fentanyl,Pain,"""I have horrible nerve pain. Neither vicodin, oxycontin, morphine or any other opium based medicine worked. Plus my body had gotten used to the other pain pills. The actiq was AMAZING! It almost completely rid me of the pain (1000x stronger than morphine) and it is measured in micrograms (Mcg)it is so powerful. It was perfect for my burning nerve pain, and nerve spasms. Easiest drug to get BOTH chemically AND mentally addicted. Be careful""",9
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I am a nurse and struggled with sleep while on night shift. I took half a Doxylamine (Restavit) and slept well.  An hour after waking I then went into fast atrial fibrillation (HR 160 - 200), I ended up in emergency needing D/C Cardio-version to revert me back to a normal rhythm.  Though I have colleagues who have had good results with this medicine I had a terrible experience and will never take it again.  POTENTIALLY a very dangerous drug!!!!  be careful.""",0
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have, very recently, started taking this medicine. The doctor seemed very adamant that it would set me straight and make me super tired and sedate  as well, potentially helping treat my somniphobia as well as the bipolar. The medication has made me so manic that I am having mixed bipolar episodes and seriously feel like jumping out of my own skin. While I appreciate not being so depressed that I&#039;m laying on the floor crying my eyes out, I do not enjoy jittering and being so amped up that I start screaming every time something frustrates me. I am so manic that it is surreal. So much for Geodon helping me out XD""",6
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I had a real rough patch of depression and over the last two years I went up from 180lbs to 275 lbs and seemed everything I tried failed.  at 5&#039;10&#039; I was diagnosed as obese, developed high blood pressure, pre-diabetic &amp; cholesterol was high. I couldn&#039;t exercise because I was so winded all the time.     Started on Saxenda November 9.  The goal is to introduce more physical activity as I start to drop the weight that&#039;s contributing to my being winded. 

I&#039;m now up to the 1.8 dose and in the first 18 days I am down 10 lbs.    Better food choices help too. 

Side effects: Slight nausea, fatigue/sleepiness and morning headaches. 

Insurance co considering entitlement because of the other comorbid factors. otherwise it&#039;s damn expensive.""",2
Topamax,Obesity,"""I have never had the feeling of being full and have fought obesity since childhood. I had a successful gastric bypass in 1980 (but with serious lifelong medical complications) and lost 170lbs at after the operation.  Over the years I&#039;ve gained and lost up to 70lbs but never held a steady weight. I saw a psychiatrist 6 years ago (for other reasons) and shared this with him.  He told me about Topamax and explained that it did not work in everyone, but had with some of his patients with true food disorders.  He started me at 5mg/day  and increased the dosage by 5mg/ week.  When I reached 150mg/day I noticed that I consistently pushed my plate away or stopped eating when I was full. It has been a miracle, and my weight hasn&#039;t varied more than 5lbs in 7 years.""",2
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I have been on Ritalin for 5 months now and it works great for my ADHD. I wish I would have been on it when I was in high school maybe I would have finished high school. I am 25 yrs old and I&#039;m going for my G.E.D so I can go to College. I am so happy now I can concentrate and do things that I was never able to do. The only con is that it is not lasting as long as it did when I first got on it. I really believe Ritalin saved my life.""",1
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I am a major insomniac, I was first prescribed trazadone (first 50 mg then 100 then 200) although the 200mg gave me excessive sweating at night as a side effect, plus trazadone only helps you to get to sleep, not stay asleep. so my doc recudes traz to 100 and put me on ami 25mg

I find amitryptamine 25mg does&#039;nt help me get to sleep, the trazadone initially puts me to sleep and I find ami gives me a full nights kip without waking up alot, I&#039;d reccommend trazadone + ami together if your doctor is willing to put you on both @ same time.""",0
Percocet,Pain,"""I have recently been prescribed Percocet for pain in relation to blood clots and 2 herniated discs in my back. I was on Dilaudid for a long time, and obviously, the doctor wanted me off.  He initially took me down to 5mg Lortab which did NOTHING.  Then he bumped me up to 10/325mg Percocet 4 x daily using 2 of them for breakthrough pain. I&#039;ve yet to get the prescription filled because I have no insurance, but I have used them in the past with fairly decent results.  It comes nowhere near IV Dilaudid which is the ONLY thing that takes my pain completely away for about 2-3 hours, but I can&#039;t be hooked up to an IV the rest of my life. (Although I would if I could just so I could be pain free!)  I&#039;ll give it a 7 for what it does.""",9
Duac,Acne,"""Very effective from the beginning! Although I came across a few side effects - redness, dryness, peeling of skin - this cream completely eliminated most of my acne. I particularly found it astonishing that over the space of a few months my Cysts had decreased - in size -dramatically. They&#039;d shrink and leak until they vanish usually not leaving any scars, only marks - which will fade over a period of time. When my skin was feeling painful due to the side effects - stinging at night - I&#039;d stop using duac for a couple of days and moisturise up. Once the side effects decreased slightly I&#039;d go back on it. I took Duac along side the antibiotic erythromycin - however I didn&#039;t find that drug effective.""",4
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Initially I hated this drug. It made me tired, run down and at times anxious. I even broke out in cold sores it made me feel so ill. Then at later stages it was a life saver. I want from 25mg to 300mg during terrible hypomamia and mixed episodes, it saved my life. Quitting it was hell you will feel sick and nauseous for weeks. It&#039;s a very strong drug and I say for type two bipolar to be used cautiously as its overly strong most of the time. You want to feel normal, not overly drugged as you do with this drug if taken for long periods of time. So for me it&#039;s a mixed review.""",6
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I have suffered from major depression since childhood and have had fibromyalgia since 2000.  I&#039;ve tried Effexor, Paxil, Elavil, Zoloft, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Nortriptyline, Prozac and on and on. All made my depression worse and left me so tired I couldn&#039;t function.  I promised her that I wouldn&#039;t quit taking it because of side effects and without talking to her first.  Three weeks I had had it but my husband kept encouraging me and my doctor was out of town. 5th week all the side effects (super, super fatigue, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, yawning, no appetite) have disappeared and I feel fabulous emotionally and physically. Give it time if you&#039;ve had little success with other antidepressants.  This one worked for me.""",5
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I am on many medications for anxiety and depression. I have struggled with sleeping as long as I can remember. Not only could I not fall asleep but I also could not stay asleep. I found myself unable to focus, not putting my best foot forward, and falling asleep in my morning classes. When my doctor put me on trazodone my life flipped around. I was a happier person. I currently take 100mg every night before bed. It helps me fall asleep and stay asleep. While I do believe that sometimes it may cause me to be tired in the morning it was well worth the trade off. I hope this can help someone in my past situation.""",0
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""Over the years I have gained a good amount of weight and it seems no matter what diet I tried after 2 weeks I found myself cheating and felt like a failure.  I was always in good physical shape but in my 30&#039;s that changed.  My dr suggested Qsymia to me and put me on it in June.  Since then I have successfully lost 29 pounds.  I exercise, I eat what I want but the portions are controlled and I only treat myself to a sliver of cake or sweets once a week.  I exercise 3 times a week.  I have had no side effects except once in awhile a dry mouth.  I give Qsymia a thumbs up-- it has given me back my confidence and has allowed me to learn to control my eating.""",3
Pristiq,Depression,"""Pristiq has significantly helped my depression.  I am finally able to wake up and get through the day like a normal person!  Initial side effects (first few days to a week): Dizziness, blurred vision, dilated pupils, fatigue, waking up in the middle of the night, jitteriness.  Ongoing side effects: dry mouth, frequent urination, jaw tension, falling asleep earlier than normal, inability to have an orgasm, and decreased appetite.  The side effects can be a bit annoying, but the benefits far outweigh the side effects.""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I started having cystic acne at age11. I had it on my face but not as bad as the big sore ozzing cysts on my back and chest and even on my breasts. It was a terrible time for me that followed me into adult hood. I had tried every antibiotic known to man. Every cream, soap and vitamin out there. Finally in 1981 a dermatologist recommended Accurate. This was the brand name one. Generics weren&#039;t so popular then. It worked wonders! I couldn&#039;t believe that I could be acne free. I still had and still do have bad scarring but no pimples or cyst s. I took it for 6 months. I was great for about 11yrs. I then developed hidradenitis on my inner thighs and stomach and breasts. I then was prescribed generic accurate. It didn&#039;t help that condition at all""",4
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lithium is the best medicine out there for Bi-Polar.  I have severe Bi-Polar with Rapid Cycling and have been on every medicine out there.  This is the only medicine that has worked.  I was always afraid to take it because of weight gain and the tests they have to run to check your lithium levels.  I&#039;m glad I decided to give it a try.  I had the shaky hands side effect really bad I couldn&#039;t even write a sentence.   My Doctor then prescribed me propranolol and after one day of taking it I have no more tremors.  I take them 4 times a day. Make sure you eat before you take the Lithium.  Good luck.""",6
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got the implant inserted at the end of April last year. I found the insertion a bit painful, but it was probably because I was stressing about it! (So try and stay calm - and definitely look away if you don&#039;t like needles). Overall I like the implant and how hassle free it is. I have had some problems with on/off bleeding though, so I use norethisterone sometimes to settle it down However I could bleed again at any time and I have no idea when that might be, which is a bit annoying. My skin is also constantly breaking out with hormonal spots, which is even worse when I&#039;m taking norethisterone. Apart from that, no problems :)""",8
Parnate,Depression,"""Been on Parnate (tranylcypromine) for about 17 years. Like many others felt like a guinea pig when I was first diagnosed. Went through about a dozen different psychiatrists. They all just tried different meds trying to find one that would work. I or anyone else could have done that. One convinced me to have ECT which I did against my better judgement. It was a nightmare of torture! After the first two I lost all sense of time as well as my memory. I had 14 ECT treatments and was nothing more than a zombie! To get it to stop I said I wasn&#039;t depressed any more. Finally found a Dr. that used Parnate.""",5
Nortriptyline,Depression,"""Day 1:  Took my first dose of 25mg last night about 2200ish.  I was still wide awake at 0100.  This morning I awoke feeling angry and irritated....reading many of the comments here this seems to be an issue with this medication.  I have had 2 failed  back surgeries and am trying to avoid the fusion every Dr has said I need.  The failed surgeries have made me extremely fearful.  I have  never ever in my life experienced anything so painful in my life.  In 2000 a microdiskectomy and laminectomy led complications. A meningocele  the size of a football on my lumbar region.  Spinal fluid coming out my nose and ears.  My head was going to explode.  Now I am willing to try anything to avoid surgery.  I&#039;ll try this for a few weeks... we will see""",5
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I started experiencing insomnia after separation and subsequent divorce.  Had &quot;back-end insomnia&quot;.  Basically I could fall asleep for 2-3hrs but then would wake up.  Suffered from this for 3 years.  Basically I have an underlying anxiety that nothing could over power.  Not ambien, lunesta, zquil, melatonin, alcohol, valerian, etc.  However, I got a cold and took Vicks nightime decongestant.  Slept like a baby.  Awoke euphoric.  It had doxylamine in it. 25 mg.  Been on for 6 weeks.  25 mg a night. Sleep 7-8 every night.  Often awake feeling great.  Euphoria is the only side effect!  Doxylamine is really good for me.  """,0
Focalin,ADHD,"""My son(11) was put on 10mg of Focalin for ADHD.  We have been trying different meds to treat his ADHD without making his anxiety/trichotillomania worse.  This med by far was the worse!  It did seem to help at school for focus, but he had extreme rage issues.  It got so bad that we called the police to find out what our options were if he were to actually hurt us or his little sister.  He never hurt us, but did break a window, the screen door, and throw objects.  Needless to say, we stopped the meds and thankfully we have our sweet son back (although he can&#039;t focus and is annoying to other kids in his class).  Please beware of mood changes with this drug.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 18 year old college freshman and started taking Vyvanse 10 months ago when I had finally gotten medicated for my severe ADD.  It has significantly changed my life for the better. For as long as I can remember, my teachers always told my parents that I was very bright but I just would not &quot;apply&quot; myself but after taking Vyvanse my grades have skyrocketed. I can finally pay attention in class and actually absorb the information. I feel energized, motivated, and more organized to do things.  My days will be filled with productivity and I feel like it boosts my mood in general. My side effects include a slight anxiety because I feel like I should ALWAYS be doing something productive so sometimes its hard for me to relax.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m 44 years old and only 5 feet tall and have struggled with my weight for over a decade. I&#039;m currently at my heaviest at 250 pounds. I was so small in high school - college 100 pounds. A friend at work lost 31 pounds on it in just 3 months. I asked him how he did it and he told me about it. I went to his doctor since my doc NEVER told me about this miracle of a pill and I just started it today. I&#039;ve read a lot of great comments about it. I do have borderline blood pressure to start with so was told to check my bp on it daily. I took one full 37.5 pill at 10 a.m. I about 2 -3 hours later I felt a little dizzy. Around 7 pm I&#039;ve had stomach upset. I&#039;m praying I loose weight on this.""",3
Minocycline,Acne,"""I have had acne since my teens- I am 36 now and I still would have it, if I didn&#039;t take Minocycline.  I started off on 100 mg a day (50 mg twice daily) and now I am down to 50 mg once a day.  I hated my acne.  It is almost completely gone (I still get a few but not many at all) and it&#039;s so worth it. I haven&#039;t had any noticeable side effects.  Plus with my insurance it&#039;s so much cheaper than all the skin stuff I tried that never worked. 
WARNING: If you are thinking about getting pregnant, get off this medicine (talk to your Dr) because it is proven to be harmful to the fetus.""",4
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I am a 57 year old woman with about 75 pounds to lose. ( If I want to get into a &quot;normal&quot; weight range.) Have been taking 10 mgs of Belviq 2x a day for the 2 1/2 weeks. 
The first day and a half, my stomach was a bit unsettled. And sometimes I feel a little fuzzy headed - but not terribly so. Now, the only thing that I experience is sleeping longer than I usually do. And - this is not a bad thing - but I sleep much better than I have for a long, long time. 
I feel like the medication is definitely taking the edge off of my hunger. While I don&#039;t &quot;forget to eat&quot; I am certainly satisfied with eating much less. Probably 1/3 to 1/2 as much. And, so far, I have a lot more will power saying &quot;no&quot; to things that I usually wouldn&#039;t pass by. 3# down!""",2
Belviq,Obesity,"""Well started belviq once a day on May 14 2015. My starting weight 187 lbs.  Nine days later weighed at 185 lbs . May not seem like a lot BUT considering  didn&#039;t go not once to the gym I think it is pretty good.!!! This coming up week I will try to do some type of exercise. 
I find though that the first pills really curbed my appetite.  Now a few pills later it doesn&#039;t seem to be as strong as the beginning. Will continue on them for one month and see how it goes. 
If I don&#039;t see a big amount of weight loss I will ask my Dr to put me on phentermine. Being that phentermine is more affordable. And it would make no sense at all to pay so much $$$$ on a pill that doesn&#039;t really cut it for me ...""",2
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have severe rheumatoid arthritis and pain is something I live with daily and I have tried many different pain killers such as Tramadol, Endone and Jurnista. I have been taking Tapentadol for almost 3 months now, starting on 100mg 2x daily and am currently taking 150mg 2x daily.  While it takes the edge off the pain it does not reduce it significantly and most nights after taking the evening tablet I manage to sleep for a few hours but wake in pain when the supposed sustained release tablet has worn off and can not get back to sleep due to high pain levels. I am heading to my GP today hoping for some relief as this really isn&#039;t doing the job.""",9
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Started Saxenda 5 weeks ago. Titrated to 3.0 ml Have lost 14.5 lbs. Side effects minimal: nausea and heartburn for approximately 2 days after increasing dose. Also more thirst and dry mouth. Side effects are tolerable. Insurance is covering and with discount card I pay $30. I am using my Fitness Pal app to track calories and nutrients. Mild exercise. Cravings for sweets are minimal, appetite is down. Very pleased with results to this point. Will be curious to see new A1c values at my next visit.""",2
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I was on Mirena for about last two months. First month wasn&#039;t to bad...spotting all day. Started breaking out some then second month everything got MUCH worse. Constanly tired, acne constant around jaw line (never had much problem with before), cravings for food and biggest one hair coming out in clumps. Doctor immediately recommended getting it removed. I did 3 days ago. I&#039;m 32 and mother of 2. Hadn&#039;t been on birth control in 4 1/2 yrs. I know everyone is not the same though. Just my experience...now starting Loesrin 24 FE pills. Pretty nervous now and hoping no side effects like used to be before having my kids. Birth control touchy thing...good luck.""",8
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I use 3/40mg Oxycontins a day with 10 5/325mg Percocet and it works wonders. Family members frown about the dosage and the fact that I am 26 and have been on pain medicines for a couple years but it takes away 80% of my pain. I just recently started taking the Oxycontin and it works great. I think this is a miracle drug. I have a 8 month old child (first one) and I am able to play with him and pick him up which I couldn&#039;t do before these.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Standing at 5&#039;3&quot; I weighed in at 228lbs Monday Sept 14th, started phentermine Tuesday mornin Sept 15th, within 20 minutes I felt a rush come over me, my heart was racing, I was sweating, numbing feeling in my arms, as well as, I felt that I couldn&#039;t get the right words out, almost tongue tied. Then about 6-8 hours later at dinner, I kept feeling like I was moving in slow motion. Side effects, the verge of a headache, not one, but could be triggered at any moment, dry mouth, and insomnia. I can usually only get 4-5 hours sleep tops. Which is extremely difficult with a 2 year old. But I have already lost 3lbs, I am keeping to a 1500 cal diet. No exercising yet due to heart rate being elevated at simple movements! Will start next week! I&#039;ll keep posting""",3
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I was taking Percocet for Facial and Scalp Neuralgia - very similar to Trigeminal Neuralgia 2 (TN2 or ATN) but instead of just face, nearly my whole scalp can have nerve pain. I was referred to a pain control specialists who initially put me on Nucynta ER. It was far less effective then the Percocet. Since I have a history of problems with extended release (ER) versions, I begged them to let me try the IR version instead. VIOLA! Real pain relief. I&#039;ve been able to lower my overall monthly allotment of pills. I feel so blessed to have such good pain control.""",9
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I have been on a moderate dose of Effexor XR (150mg) for about two years and anxiety started to creep in lately.  My doctor put me on 5mg of Buspar 3x a day about a month ago.  So far it seems to have taken the sharp &quot;edge&quot; off of the anxiety, but it isn&#039;t the miracle I was hoping for. He just raised my dose to 15mg 2x a day, so I&#039;ll report back in a month or so to see if the dosage increase helps.""",7
Olanzapine,Insomnia,"""I have been prescribed Zyprexa 10mg just two days ago. It was prescribed for insomnia and an extra medication for my depression. I have not slept as well as I was told I would. I have had major restlessness in my legs and arms to where I haven&#039;t slept well at all. I have felt very drowsy during the day. I have also tried Ambein which also gave me restlessness in my legs. Not sure if this is right one for me either. Maybe I just need more time? I have noticed I am eating more throughout the day. Not worried about that so much since I need to put on some weight.""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I began taking Saxenda on 11/3/15 weighing in at 252 lbs....today I weigh 227 lbs!!  25 lbs in a little over 3 months!!  I am excited.  I know that is only about 8 lbs a month but that is good...I have always heard that you need to take it slow. I have tried every diet/weight loss program that you can imagine and nothing has ever worked for me.  I am 43 years old and I was tired of my quality of life being so miserable. I however have it a plateau, I haven&#039;t lost anything in the past 2 weeks.  I plan to start doing some cardio to hopefully increase the weight loss.  Any suggestions would be helpful!!  Since I began taking this med, both of my daughters and one of my son-in-laws have reverted to using this as their daily life style as well.""",2
Accutane,Acne,"""Accutane has been a miracle drug for me. I have not had a single pimple since the 2nd month of treatment, and I&#039;ve been off it for just under a month. My acne, like others, was horrible before Accutane. Another thing to note, I had virtually zero side-effects, just a little bit of dryness around my mouth and lips. It was NOTHING like the horror stories you read about on the web. Just brush your lips with a toothbrush in the morning and at night and put some aquaphor/lip balm on after and you&#039;ll be fine for the whole day. I also always ate tons of healthy fats (grass-fed butter and meat, eggs, organic full-fat dairy, coconut butter, avocados, olive oil, macadamia nuts, and natural peanut butter) with my Accutane, so that may have helped too.""",4
Ambien CR,Insomnia,"""Well I have been on Ambien CR 12.5 mg for close to 6 years now and absolutely love it. I think it is the best thing since sliced bread. I developed insomnia when I started doing shift work and tried everything under the sun starting with melatonin, Benadryl, Restoril and all the new ones that have come out since and although some were helpful with helping me fall asleep, they did not keep me asleep past the 3-4 hour mark..so the Ambient CR has been great for me.""",0
Victoza,Obesity,"""This drug makes me so lethargic I can&#039;t drive for fear of falling asleep at the wheel. I can barely get out of bed. This got worst when my MD upped the dose to 1.8, I think maybe I should go back a dose. I lose 5lbs in 4 weeks, but I haven&#039;t decided its worth since I am so fatigued I can&#039;t function on a normal level. Most days I can&#039;t even get out of my pajamas but it is the only sympton I have experienced. My MD said he had not heard this complaint from any other patient.""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started on Saxenda as a last resort in late February. I&#039;m 26, 5&#039;6 and weighed 217 when I first started my weight loss journey. I&#039;ve lost inches on my own by working out every single day and watching what I eat, but the pounds were staying the same. I&#039;ve taken Phenteramine, HCG shots, and so many different weight loss pills only to be disappointed and not successful. It&#039;s been almost a month since I started Saxenda and I&#039;m down to 196 lbs. I&#039;m never hungry, and even though I have nausea and fatigue, I&#039;m not complaining. I plan on staying on this until I lose my goal of 70 pounds. With my insurance alone the medication was going to be $100, but with the coupon card on mysaxendacard.com I got it for $30 for 5 pins!""",2
Concerta,ADHD,"""I am very happy with Concerta. I am 17 years old and started taking this about 3 months ago. Before I took this, I had a lot of trouble in school with paying attention and focusing, and after I took it, I noticed an immediate difference and it was so much easier to focus and pay attention. Another really positive feedback from Concerta is that it helps me engage in conversation more because I am more focused and I don&#039;t interrupt people like I used to. Also, it helps me think things through more.""",1
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had sleep issues my whole life and had just sort of dealt with it.  I finally spoke with a Dr. about it and was prescribed Lunesta.  Over a couple of weeks, taking it ~3 nights a week, I was sleeping better for the most part. Then, my emotions started going haywire.  I was quick to anger and feeling paranoid.  I was convinced my wife was having an affair (she wasn&#039;t) and had multiple outbursts.  I have never been on any sort of medication for a period of time, so I didn&#039;t think to blame the Lunesta.  I stopped taking it and the crazy emotions have stopped.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am smack in the middle of the effects of this drug. NOT on the effects it has on ADHD but the effects it has on the rest of my mental health... I first started Vyvanse 4 years ago, with no other underlying mental health issues other than ADHD. When I first started taking the Vyvanse, it completely saved my life. I was confident, energetic, motivated, and happy. Only about a month later, stopped working SIGNIFICANTLY and I felt like my life was over, that was because in only a short month, I became addicted to SPEED, which is what this is, by the way. It will help you INCREDIBLY, but only for the amount of hours it works before it wears off, and then you will feel worse than you have ever felt in your life, and end up getting addicted.""",1
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Last night was the first night that I have had a full restful sleep since I was eighteen and I am 72 years old.  I was not groggy and did not have a hangover. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 1996 and I could not tell if the muscle aches were from the fibromyalgia or the medication but the muscle aches disappeared after I got up and moved around.  I am grateful that my doctor prescribed Trazodone.""",0
Doxycycline,Acne,"""My acne cleared up over a couple months, but after I finished the course, my digestive system was destroyed. For four years I struggled to figure out what was wrong with me, I was plagued by brain fog, poor memory, and low energy levels after eating certain foods. Turns out, the doxycycline decreased my gut motility, killed off a large percentage of my good bacteria, and ultimately I developed something called SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth). I&#039;m currently being treated for SIBO, but I will likely never be able to properly digest gluten or dairy again and I&#039;m only 20 years old. Trust me when I say that taking this for acne is not worth it under any circumstance. Diet is a much better option.""",4
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Latuda for about 2 months now, I take 120mg at about 8-8:45pm every night. Positives are that it makes me have almost no manic episodes and very few &quot;mood switches&quot;. It has also helped with my sleep. Before I was getting about 2-4 hours asleep at most each day. Now with the Latuda I sleep from about 9pm till 10am. The struggles I have with it are that it makes it very very hard to get up in the morning for school or whatever unless I get to sleep in until my body is ready. It has also made it very hard for me to eat. Since starting I have lost nearly 15 pounds. Other than that Latuda has made a huge impact on my life. I&#039;m finally starting too feel like how a normal 16yr old should!""",6
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I am very pleased with Hydroxyzine. It is non-addictive &amp; it always helps with my panic attacks &amp; anxiety. It doesn&#039;t always get rid my anxiety completely, but it definitely takes the edge off of it, which is enough to help me function. The only side effect I sometimes get is dry mouth, so make sure to drink plenty of water if that happens to you. Biotene mouthwash also helps with that. Hydroxyzine can make you sleepy, so don&#039;t try to drive or do anything productive, until you see how it affects you.""",7
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I struggled for years with not only insomnia,  but waking up several times thru the night when I would fall asleep (usually anywhere ftom 2-3 hours after going to bed and laying there with everything from bills to elementry school friends and worrying about my son). Many many times I would dose off then after sleeping an hour or so, wake up wide eyed and bushy tailed as if I had gotten a full 8 hours of sleep. I would do this several times a night then fall into a deep REM sleep right before the alarm went off. This action made me extremely tired, cranky, and totally unmotivated the whole next day. My Dr finally has me on a good combo and I sleep. 250 mg&#039;s of seriquel and 300 mg&#039;s of trazodone. And if needed...vistril.""",0
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""I have been taking zohydro now for about 3 months and what a difference it has made. My doctor will be increasing the dosage from the 20mg to the 40mg because I still take hydrocodone for breakthrough pain and the zohydro doesn&#039;t quite take the pain away at the current 20mg. I started at a lower dose to see if there were any reactions to the medication and to date I have had none. It doesn&#039;t last the 12 hours as it says but that has been the case with any time released meds that I have tried due to my metabolism. It is hard to find and cvs pharmacy has paperwork that their corporate office has to have completed before they will fill the prescription and that can take a month. Insurance did cover it after a formulary exemption was filed.""",9
Belviq,Obesity,"""My Dr prescribed Belivq seven months ago and I took it for less than a week. I didn&#039;t give it a try. During a follow up visit we discussed weight loss/appetite suppressant options again and my Dr encouraged me to try start over. After an in depth chat I decided to give it a real try so I started again in 1/2016.  I am extremely pleased with the results! I have experienced zero side effects, which was my concern with not wanting to take the medicine when initially prescribed, a curbed appetite and noticeable weight loss. My health insurance doesn&#039;t cover this particular medicine but its my opinion that it is worth paying for out of pocket.  I have recommended Belviq and highly suggest people speak to their Dr about Belviq as an option.""",2
Etodolac,Pain,"""I had severe pain in both shoulders for a couple of years and tried everything offered over the counter and some prescriptions that were mind benders to me. After surgery the pain was reduced from a 10 to a 5 which was almost tolerable. Ibuprofen caused constipation and aspirin caused stomach problems. A young female intern at the VA finally prescribed the Etodolac and now I live nearly pain free most of the time. Even the developed back pain that has developed over the years is more tolerable and I can live a normal life with little restraint.""",9
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Risnia/Risperdal for a few years now. Currently on a dosage of 2mg of the generic Risnia. As an answer to Bipolar Disorder with psychotic features this drug works wonders and I have been without relapse for 3 years now. My biggest frustration however is the weight gain. I have put on 8 kg during this time and I eat like a bird. I have tried a number of diets and exercise 3-4 times per week.  My psychiatrist mentioned slightly decreasing the dosage every second day and see if that helps. I will try this as soon as I get a new script with 1mg pills. Can anyone recommend a good alternative?""",6
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This drug is a god send I suffered from bipolar since I was 17 im now 21 I have mixed episode that last for 6 month or more. I tried evey single medicine and I mean every thing antidepressant make me worse I have panic attack, fears ,alot of tears, a lot of depression, obsessive songs in my head lol and nothing seems to work like this one. I left all other drugs (not cold turkey ) , and started it and within 2 weeks I got normal - no panic, no depression and of course no hypomanic no side effect at all , this drug saved I&#039;m more stable focused try it if you are bipolar 2 its a game changer""",6
Doxycycline,Acne,"""Hello  I have had severe acne for almost 10 years. I carried on because I don&#039;t have enough money to check in dermatologists. And thankful of my boss he bought me to the hospital here in Kuwait Adan. Doctors give me the medicine  doxycycline and taking for 1 month and also cream Ipeduo and now thanks be to God the acne cleared. And now am comfortable with my face and when I look in the mirror happy and can smile without curiosity. 
Thanks doxycycline and Ipidou cream""",4
Oxycodone,Pain,"""Following my surgery, I was given Oxycodone instead of Percocet &quot;to protect my liver &quot;.  Oxycodone had an immediate effect that lasted just 30 minutes, and then the pain returned each time. What was worse is the psychotropic effect of this drug on me. While taking Oxycodone for 4 days, I was depressed, restless and constantly brooding about the ills and suicides of others.  Oxycodone was very bad for me, and it&#039;s psychotropic and near-hallucinatory components must be exposed. I switched to Tylenol with Codeine and felt back to myself the following morning.""",9
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I am starting on a low dose as I was given a stimulant type at first, which made me feel sick and stopped me sleeping. So now I am on Atomxetine but just a low dose as I seem to suffer badly with side effects. At my recent assessment, the doc told me to increase dose to 40mg, then 80, but I decided to start on 20 mg, then 40 second week. Only I am finding I can&#039;t sleep so I am going to try to take about 2 hours before bedtime, see if that helps. Not sure what to do if these don&#039;t work ...Any advice would be grateful, thanks""",1
Copper,Birth Control,"""I had my paragard inserted in the office in June of 2015. Per my OB it was in place at my 6 week check up. In the first 4 months after insertion I had moderate to severe cramping and was informed by my OB that this was normal. In June 2016 my IUD was no longer visible in my cervix. An ultrasound was scheduled. Four days later I had a positive pregnancy test. The ultrasound confirmed the pregnancy and the IUD was not visible so was assumed to have fallen out. I gave birth in February of 2017. A follow up X-ray and subsequent  hysterectomy confirmed the paragard was still in my body, but not in my uterus. I had my Paragard surgically removed in October 2017 and it was found to have perforated my uterus and small intestine.""",8
Lithobid,Bipolar Disorde,"""Many years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar ll. Lithium was my doctor&#039;s first choice. Not even sure how effective it was. The side effects were awful. I could not work, I lost down to 95 pounds. I was so weak I had difficulty climbing stairs. I shook so bad I could not sign my own name. Then my doctor started to add all sorts of medicines to counteract the side effects. I became hypothyroid had to take medicines for that, tremor had to take medicines for that (didn&#039;t work well). Dr. decreased dose (didn&#039;t help much). I was on leave from work for 12 weeks. Finally stopped the lithium. It took awhile for my Dr. to believe my problems with this medicine because they were not typical. Those 12 weeks were the worst.""",6
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I have been trying to lose weight on my own for a year. I have hypothyroid issues, was 252 plus pounds, 5&#039;9&quot;, 60 y/o female. I ate 1300 to 1500 calories per day, vigorously exercised 3 x a week and lost 17 lbs. over 9 months. Then it stopped cold, no matter what I did I couldn&#039;t lose any more weight. After talking to my doctor about my frustration about my slow metabolism,  she prescribed Qsymia. I started in mid September and I&#039;ve lost 17 lbs more in 2 months. I&#039;m now down to 217 and falling. I feel good, and plan to keep going. Biggest side effects are fatigue and constipation.  I can handle that.  I like being able to feel my hip bones again.""",2
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I don&#039;t understand why there are so many high (8-10) ratings for this drug.
After reading so many who experienced negative effects, yet they gave a high rating.
My first night taking my 1mg. prescription, I woke up thirsty and spilled water all over myself. Not a big deal. A while later, I rolled out of bed onto a bedside table and bruised myself badly. I had never before fallen out of bed. After the first night, I slept well and continued using it with no noticeable side effects.
After using up my 3 months prescription, I was told that I needed to go to my doctor&#039;s office for paper prescription. I&#039;m 68 years old, disabled and live 16 miles from my doctor&#039;s office.
I am now suffering with horrible withdrawal symptoms!""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started the medication 7/21.  I had to change taking at night time as I was so tired &amp; nauseous. I&#039;m so disappointed as I&#039;m the only one who is not losing weight.  5&#039;2&quot; 222lb. I have all the side affects of the medication (nauseous, tired, slight headache(gone now) &amp; no appetite). Overall I eat pretty healthy &amp; not a lot, so I don&#039;t understand why no weight loss (I&#039;m eating even less now). I am female, 54, so menopause &amp; thyroid issues are not helping, but I was so hopeful. Anyone else not have success?? Medication is pricey &amp; side affects for not working..... I go up to the 3.0 dose Friday... still hoping.""",2
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""The side-effects suck. I would get a bloody nose at least 5 times a day, my lips would peel and get blisters, and my arms would get rashes. But it was all worth it. Accutane is amazing. I am so thankful for it. I had acne for 6 years and I tried everything you could imagine to try and clear my face up. Now after 4 long months, I am just now taking my last pill. I go to the mirror and I don&#039;t see a pimple, scar, or even a red mark on my face. my self-esteem has improved so much. I would definitely recommend it.""",4
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""At first, I had a few headaches and lost 6lbs in 30 days. But what is really amazing is that it made me nauseous to drink alcohol. After 4 weeks, I was to celebrate with a nice healthy dinner including wine but after drinking 1/2 glass, it made me feel so bad, I had to chug water to not vomit. Now, I can&#039;t even think about having alcohol because of how it made me feel. Contrave should be marketed for alcohol addiction! On a negative side, after 30 days, I have severe cravings for sweets which I have not had before. I plan to continue Contrave for the full 90 days, so time will tell if it is worth it. Stay tuned!""",3
Duloxetine,Depression,"""Been on this med for 1 week.  30 mg.  Within hours I felt better.  I have fibromyalgia and depression.  Was on 30 mg Celexa for 18 years and it no longer worked.  Fibro became so bad I was afraid I would have to retire.  Couldn&#039;t work properly and difficulty concentrating in the office.  Went to a new doctor who recommended Cymbalta.  Started it in a.m. and by 3 p.m. the pain was starting to ease.  A miracle drug to me.  Stayed on 10 mg for 5 days along with the Cymbalta.  When stopped Celexa no withdrawal.  This med has changed my life.  The sun came out again.  Everyone reacts differently to meds so I won&#039;t say everyone should take, but it certainly has worked for me.""",5
Cymbalta,Pain,"""After the removal of a tumour and bone graft surgery I suffered from debilitating pain that occurred at night which ultimately kept me from sleeping.  For years, me and the doctors searched for the source of the pain but they could not find a reason and I was told to live with it.  This year I was suggested Cymbalta because my doctor had said it was working as a pain reliever for other patients.  I was willing to try anything to rid the pain and After about 3 weeks I noticed a dramatic decrease in my pain.  After a few months I am practically pain free. For those who deal with chronic pain on a daily basis this is best thing that could happen.  I never thought anything would help, Cymbalta has given me my life back.""",9
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have to say this drug did more harm then good and my body is very dependent on it. In only a year span I started having serious weight and back issues. I have never had any issues with my back but all of a sudden my bones started to get brittle. Then the disc herniations started happening, and like a domino effect entire spine was damaged. I see along of info on children or babies effected with their spine but apparently it can do the same for a grown adult. I was put on this med for anxiety and what my dr thought was bp. Turns out as time goes by dr lowers my depakote and cAme to the conclusion I do not have bp. Great.. Damage done.. Abnormal EEG. , spine damage, and severe chemical dependency .. Lost my hair , my looks, weight .""",6
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I began this medication 6 weeks ago I read reviews first and thought wow this might work . over the last 10 years I have lost 135 lbs through diet and exercise , I am recovering from an injury and can&#039;t workout with the intesity I was had so I began this drug didn&#039;t notice any side effects or loss of appetite, the next week I increased the dosage with no results either , from reading reviews I thought what&#039;s wrong with me that it doesn&#039;t work I increased the third week only to feel sick , and thought I don&#039;t want to feel this way I rarely put reviews up but I want people to know it&#039;s not just them it didn&#039;t work for others as well""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Ive been on nexplanon for about 7 months now after being on the depo shot for 4 years. The application of the nexplanon was easy and fairly painless. The biggest issue I have with nexplanon is the bleeding I&#039;ve been having for 6 out of the 7 months on this. And I&#039;m not talking spotting, I mean bleeding moderately heavy everyday for 6 months. Finally after I couldn&#039;t take it anymore I went to my doctor and she gave me a second birth control, the patch in hopes of stopping the bleeding from the extra estrogen and it worked!!! Ive been using the patch for a month now and I havent bled at all. I will probably stay on this for a while and eventually go back to the shot.""",8
Topamax,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on every medicine. I&#039;ve had electroshock therapy. Medications don&#039;t really work for me very well. I&#039;m only taking Lithium ER 450 mg right now cos my body can&#039;t handle more of it. I was taking Topamax for headaches, I thought, but my psychiatrist said it might help my mood. Been taking it for years. I didn&#039;t know that it did work for me until I stopped using it. I broke into a manic episode because I started taking that Garcinia weight loss thing, and I wasn&#039;t on the Topamax. Well, I guess Topamax DOES work. """,6
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""It&#039;s great birth control because your husband will never want to have sex with you when you are bleeding for 3 straight months. I had nexplanon in for 3 months and bled the entire time. A romantic vacation was ruined along with countless pairs of underwear. I have never spent so much money in such a short time for tampons,pads and panty liners in my life because I never knew what type of flow I was going to have besides a constant one. I&#039;m 35 and never felt more like a teenager because of horrible spotting, break outs and no sex.  I thought this would be a great alternative but it has put a definite strain on my day to day life. Now I am back in birth control and still bleeding.""",8
Benzaclin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I have seen a LITTLE difference. But it does take time, and my doctor said it would get better before it gets worse. I&#039;m still holding out hope! My acne is pretty bad on my face. On my sides, my forehead, and my jawline. It is really bad. But I have faith in this product. Because my acne will not go away for anything! It is extremly stubborn. I&#039;m 18 so that may be part of the problem. I got this free with my isurance otherwise it would have be $380!! So, it better work. Only problem is it drys out my skin so I&#039;d recommend lotion!""",4
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""This drug has been a lifesaver to me. It&#039;s helped provide me with mood stability with an antidepressant effect, whereas lithium only controlled the mania part of my mood. I use this in combination with other drugs  and so far there hasn&#039;t been any side effects. I tried decreasing the dosage, and within 2 days I noticed a difference in my mood. I would definitely recommend this drug. This has made a difference in my mood, the way I think, and my overall perspective. This improved my motivation to get work done, since I wouldn&#039;t be just sitting around reminiscing in a negative thought loop. It gives me mental freedom and allows me to escape brain fog that has imprisoned my thoughts. Seriously, don&#039;t be afraid to try this drug""",6
Phentermine,Obesity,"""Weighed in at 218lbs (35  BMI). I started out with Wii-Fit workout 2-30 minute sessions or 60 minutes aerobics 5  days weekly [work up to it] if you hit a plateau, then increase by 10 minutes. Eat 300 calories breakfast, 200 calortie snack 300 lunch 200 snack, 300 dinner. Space meals by 2-1/2 to 3 hours. Use fingers. With Phentermine 37.5 you&#039;ll have to remind yourself to eat, I logged it into my cell phone calendar.  No bottle/canned juices or sodas. Nothing 3 hours before sleeping. Most important limit sugars, starches AND GLUTEN. Set up a pitcher of water in the morning (I add 2 propel packets) to track your water intake. Keep chapstick in your pocket for dry lips. These simple steps and I&#039;m 45 lbs lighter in 70 days. GOOD LUCK! """,2
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I have been using Loestrin for about 5 months now. The first 3 months I would get a bit of nausea and cramps, but the doctor said to keep taking for three months because it is supposed to resemble pregnancy! I was fine after the 3 months. I haven&#039;t had too many problems with it for the past 2 months. This month have been having really bad stomach aches and cramps. I&#039;m not sure if it is the pill or something else? """,8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started Phen on March 23rd and weight 193.  As of June 27th, I weighed 169.  My goal weight is 155. (I&#039;m 5&#039;10&quot;) I took a whole pill for the first couple of weeks...but, experienced extreme side effects - jitters, cotton mouth, breathing irregularities, constipation etc.  I decreased my intake to 1/2 pill every morning and the side effect were more manageable.  I now take the weekends off on the pill and exercise when my schedule allows.  I eat extremely clean...Except for a couple of glasses of wine every now and then.  I&#039;ve also gotten the lipo shot 3 times since I&#039;ve been in Phen.""",3
Copper,Birth Control,"""I had my copper iud for a year before getting it removed due to constant bacterial vaginosis. I was going to the doctor every few months for an odor that never seemed to go away. I took metrodinazole that only helped me temporarily and then the BV would come back. I hated smelling myself because it was embarrassing and I got tired of going to the doctor. i never got pregnant and I thank the iud for that. but the odor and the pelvic pain that came with it made me take it out. my cramps were so bad with the iud, i would almost start crying. I also got eczema after getting the iud, which i never had prior to that. now I&#039;ve had the iud out for two months and my BV has completely gone away, i still have eczema, and i get NO cramps with my period""",8
Quillivant XR,ADHD,"""My 4yr old son has Autism/ADHD/OCD. After coming off of Risperidone my sons&#039; Neurologist wanted to try my son on Quillivant XR. Our Pharmacy had to special order this med due to there was nobody else in this county that takes it. The 1st dose of this med that my son took he went WILD!!! He got violent with us, and just refused to eat ANYTHING, he was also up for 22hr straight! He only had 2 doses of this med (day 1 &amp; 2) then I had to call his Dr and to have him taken off the med. We ended up going back on Risperidone and Guanfacine. Once I stopped giving my son the Quillivant XR med he started acting like his old self again.""",1
Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I have been on this medicine for over a year now. It was helpful in controlling the anxiety and panic attacks so much so that with the help of other holistic therapies (chiropractic twice weekly, nettle infusions, herbs and blood type diet to cleanse colon) that I feel its time to try life without medicines once again.
Ruminating thoughts snowballing, vivid and often violent dreams are constant and have been all throughout the treatment. I plan on taking myself off over the next 6 months so I can learn to FULLY relax. Now my anxiety is under control and my lifestyle has changed to enable that to continue.""",7
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I&#039;m 22, and my doctor changed me from Effexor to Pristiq for my OCD and OCPD. Most noticeable side effect is definitely the appetite loss, but I don&#039;t seem to be losing much weight thankfully. If I&#039;m busy and don&#039;t think about it, I go all day without food- it&#039;s nuts. Also I am having a lot of headaches, but I cannot be sure its the medicine. I sweat A LOT on this, and if I take it too late in the day I cannot sleep. My OCD seems to be in check- much better than Effexor. I&#039;ve been taking 50 mg for 5 months now.""",5
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I was on the pill for about 5 years when I got tired of taking them daily. They worked perfectly fine, though - so I decided to explore my other options. I have been on Nexplanon for about 4 months now. I&#039;ve only bled once since insertion, and it was very predictable as my breasts became very tender for 2 weeks prior. The flow itself was light, and I didn&#039;t experience cramps, nausea, nor migraines. My skin didn&#039;t react well at first, but now it&#039;s back to normal. The most negative thing about the implant is that my mood has been down during this entire time. I don&#039;t get excited for anything - whether it be outings, sex, etc. - and I&#039;m very irritable.""",8
Sertraline,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking Zoloft for 6 months now...began at 25mg. and worked up to 75 mg.  I&#039;m a person who hates being on medicines, so I tapered off to 50 mg and then tried to go back down to 25 mg.  Unfortunately the symptoms came back, racing pulse and anxiety.  I&#039;m now back at 50 mg and feel even keel.  It has been humbling for me to admit that I need this medication and I dislike how it makes you feel dependent on it, but I also realize it is doing its job.  I have lost 5-10 pounds since starting it.  The first few weeks I was in a fog and suffered horrible headaches and nausea, but per my doctor&#039;s words those symptoms did subside.  I&#039;ve not had a single panic attack since starting Zoloft.  """,5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I loved the product! I started June 1, 2014 to August 2014. IN 2 MONTHS I HAD LOST 30 LBS! I was doing Zumba 3 times a week and had a personal trainer to help tone my body with my new found ENERGY. The Personal Trainer was a waste because Adipex with Zumba was doing a tremendous job all on its own. I wasn&#039;t craving sweets thanks to Adipex. I cut out fast foods, carbs, and late night eating. Plus I drank anywhere from 1/2 to a gallon A DAY! However, the medicine still made me constipated. I started at 244 and got down to 209lbs. I stopped using it for about 5 months AND THE WEIGHT STAYED OFF, while not eating so healthy. """,3
Adapalene,Acne,"""I have only been using Differin for a few days. I have seen a big difference from other regions I have been using. Today, I had a breakout. Like the one I orginally got that sent me to the doctor. I spoke with the pharmacist. She had told me that this particular medication tends to get worse before it gets better. Being hopeful I am still using my Finacea in the mornings and my Metronidazole topical in the afternoons and the Differin before bed. All the while taking the prescribed medication as well. Also always use an additional moisturizer because these all like to dry your skin out.  Another thing to add if you are on the minocycline and differin both are sensitive to sunlight. So if you go out use a moisturizer with sunblock. Roscea 1yr""",4
Zoloft,Depression,"""I have suffered from depression for about six years now. I am a female and about to turn 22. I was put on Zoloft because I recently began to experience severe anxiety over little things. Walking around campus terrified me. I couldn&#039;t go through drive-thru&#039;s or phone someone I didn&#039;t know. My mood swings were becoming ridiculous and I had been having more obsessive suicidal thoughts. I started Zoloft 50mg and everything was wonderful for a month then it wore off. I slipped back into severe depression. I just started taking 100mg and feel so much better! The only side effect I have experienced are a little insomnia, slight loss of appetite, random hand twitching, and some forgetfulness. I finally enjoy life and don&#039;t want to just give up.""",5
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking lexapro for about a year now and it seems to help a lot with my social anxiety. I don&#039;t think about nor care what people think as much as I used to. But it does make me kinda have like no emotion toward people&#039;s feeling &amp; what not. Which is a downside. But I used to be afraid of big crowds. I wouldn&#039;t really want to be around people but at the same time I did because I wanted to have friends and be outgoing but it was extremely hard for me. Also I had like mild depression, always negative thoughts. But since I&#039;ve been taking it it&#039;s definitely made me more positive and more friendly. Before I would always worry about everything and when I say everything I mean everything lol. With out it I do have bad withdrawal &amp; it sucks.""",7
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""I think this drug (15mg) significantly helped me with my insomnia initially. But I don&#039;t think it did anything for me beyond the first couple of weeks, as my insomnia began to rebound. I think this is a good SHORT-term drug; I would resist the temptation to take it for longer periods for the treatment of insomnia, since most of its sedation effects wear off within weeks (as with all sedatives).""",0
Paxil,Depression,"""I&#039;ve used Paxil when I was in my 20&#039;s for depression and anxiety. Paxil worked great for me. Side effects were loss of appetite for 2 weeks and taking long to ejaculate which I loved this side effect. Through the years I have been on and off Paxil with it working for me every time but I notice as I got into my 30&#039;s it made me very drowsy when taking it. Of all my time of taking Paxil I have never taken it for more than 3 months. I experience the brain zaps once only when I used it for the 1st time. Never had a problem going off Paxil since that 1st time. I would recommend Paxil for depression and definitely anxiety. However, the last time I took it in my 40&#039;s it was causing me stomach problem and made my throat feel scratchy all the time.""",5
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Surprised at results so far. I travel and eat out often so I cannot prepare my meals very often. I have lost 15 lbs in 7 weeks which for me is unbelievable. I never felt better ever. I can&#039;t explain the burst of energy I feel. I know it doesn&#039;t affect metabolism and there is no increase in heart rate or blood pressure so that can&#039;t be it. With my hectic lifestyle, dieting has become so very easy. i have recommended this to my wife and friend!""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Awesome form of birth control. I been on its since December 2014. It has not failed me once. My periods with out BC are every month with BC it&#039;s every two to three months witch is great. Also I have noticed the only side effect for me is when I&#039;m going to start my menstural I&#039;ll develop a little bit of acne otherwise great method and I&#039;m going to renew it for another three years.""",8
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I started with victoza in feb  for diabetes. It made an amazing difference in my sugar numbers. I also cut out 95 percent of sugars i was (over)eating.  Between the two  I&#039;ve lost 50 pounds in about 4 months. (i cut out sugar in january)  Ive had some stomach upset which comes across as a mix of feeling full and cramps. Nothing too bad and honestly worth it considering the results. MY a1c is now 5.5 from  10 when i started.
The thing i like the most is my appetite is gone.  I am 45 years old and i&#039;ve never not felt hungry.  I&#039;ve always wanted to eat and did eat with out realizing how much I consumed.  Many times the sight and taste of food turns me off now which is actually nice. Sounds weird but I know there are those who will understand.""",3
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""First I must say that Latuda has done something for me I never thought possible from any medication. It has almost completely wiped my depression and anxiety away. I the first time I tried Latuda I woke up the next day a whole new person. I could believe it! I take Lamictal, Cymbalta and Latuda everyday. 1 mg of Ativan as needed for anxiety. My Doc replaced my Abilify with Latuda and my whole life has changed. It&#039;s expensive though and I found a lot of insurances will not pay for it without prior authorization my doc. We will see how that goes. If you feel hopeless like you have tried all the meds and nothing has worked i&#039;m telling you to ask your Doc to put you on Latuda.""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have been taking Vyvanse on and off for a little over 2 years. I am currently taking 70mg. It really helps me focus and multi-task at work. It also has helped with my anxiety and I am able to tackle things that normally I would try to stay away from doing because of my anxiety. I usually take it during the weekdays and not take it on the weekends because I can go 10 to 12 hours without eating and barely having anything to drink because my appetite is not there. I&#039;ve lost 95 pounds since taking Vyvanse. It also has made my libido go through the roof. There&#039;s an upside and downside to the medication. Overall, it has helped more than it has hurt but there are negatives and positives.""",1
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I am a 15 year old female experiencing acne from puberty. I was prescribed the medication by my dermatologist. I am also using Acanya un the morning with Neutrogena SPF. In addition, I am moisturizing with Cetaphil.
At first I noticed the treatment was working well besides mild stinging and redness, but after three weeks I am now having an increase in white heads in areas I have never had any problems with like my cheeks and chin. The acne seems to be small fine bumps that are deep under my skin - I believe theses are called closed comodones. Hopefully this is just the initial breakout.""",4
Accutane,Acne,"""I am currently into my second month with Accutane. I first took it to get rid of a few really deep pimples on my back; my face was almost perfectly clear. After starting Accutane, however, my face broke out horrifically. It looked like I wasn&#039;t on any medicine or washing my face at all. I kept persisting, hoping that it would clear up, meanwhile my social confidence dropped a ton. I still find new, deep, cystic zits when I wake up in the morning, despite taking Accutane faithfully, exactly to my dermatologist&#039;s instructions. I finally decided about 2 weeks ago to use a salicylic acid scrub along with Accutane, and that has seemed to help a lot. However my back is still developing deep zits. I just hope in the end that Accutane will start working.""",4
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""I was suffering with anxiety depression and obsessive compulsive disorder when I was 17. It got so bad that I was willing to try anything to help me even if it was just a little bit. I was prescribed paroxetine and the first day I took it, I could not believe how much better I felt. The anxiety was completely gone and the excessive negative thinking and worrying was gone. It was honestly a miracle pill for me. I&#039;m 27 years old now and have been struggling with stress and OCD again. I&#039;m wondering if I should see my doctor to give me a prescription for this again!""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I started taking this pill and immediately noticed the difference. My life literally changed the moment I took the first pill. While I suffered from uncontrollable speech the first 2 days but my body adjusted. I started with 50mg and I now take 70mg. I am 23 years old. Some other side effects I have experienced are decreased sexual drive, loss of weight and appetite. However, I can concentrate on anything. This pill has taken the characteristic of lazy out of me. I am more productive than ever.""",1
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""My psychiatrist recommended that I try 5mg of melatonin instead of other OTC sleep aids. I have anxiety disorder and have trouble not worrying about intruders at night. I took this 30 minutes before bed time and I felt extremely tired within an hour. That was nice. I woke up an hour later from I&#039;m not sure what. Easy to go back to sleep. Then a total of 3 hours later, I woke up gasping for air. From a nightmare a presume, although I couldn&#039;t remember the nightmare. I then woke up around 5am from my neighbors in my apartment building. I felt alert but made it back to sleep. I then was not able to wake up the rest of the morning. I couldn&#039;t get up to go to work and I still feel tired at noon the next day. Wondering how to move forward.""",0
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I started taking Ambien for insomnia about a month ago. It works great if I am able to take it early enough to get in 8 hours of sleep...however...I also take Wellbutrin and apparently they do not work well together. I have been sleep eating, sundaes, brownies, yogurt, sandwiches. I also cook and leave the mess behind and don&#039;t remember ANY OF IT. I colored my hair with two colors, and gave myself the worst haircut I&#039;ve ever had in my life and was totally shocked the next morning when I saw the bright pink color in my hair and awful short bangs and uneven length. I had a conversation with my daughter and gave her permission to spend the night out which I would NOT have done in my right mind and she made me write it down for proof!""",0
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Been taking Concerta XL for a while with a steady titration from 18mg up to 81mg. I take it around 9am each morning and the first few hours are very restless. However by early noon say 1-2pm I go into a slow sometimes dragging comedown which makes me sleepy and therefore having a knap during the day. This leads to an almost sleepless night which can upset my brain in many ways.
Positives:
Alert, talkative, sociable and above all CONCENTRATE.
Negatives:
Jaw Clenching (gurning), sweaty, sleepless night (because of the midday knap)
All in all I have tried alteting dosage times in the morning and I can quite easily eat without feeling nausea. Weight loss is noticable but at a good stable rate. Many people have to give Concerta a chance.""",1
Modafinil,Depression,"""This is a WONDER DRUG in the use of depression. I have suffered for years with depression and never with any relief from the mainstream anti-depressants. Either the side effects were intolerable, or the medicine just didn&#039;t work. Within 3 days of taking Provigil, I was the happiest, most productive I had been in a year. The first 2 days I was still really sleepy, and the 3rd day, a little hyper, but after that day I have felt EXCELLENT. I don&#039;t have anxiety attacks anymore and I get a full night of &quot;good&quot; sleep and wake up feeling extremely refreshed and I am happy again. I was on my couch for a straight 6 months sleeping and crying until I started this medicine. It literally saved my life.""",5
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I really wanted this medication to work and took it for 2 weeks.  The side effects were unbearable (I am not a weenie)!!!  Headaches, nausea, dizziness and tinnitus were continuous.  I think you lose weight on this medication because you feel so miserable you don&#039;t even think about eating.  I want to lose weight, but don&#039;t want to feel totally crappy doing it.  Back to weight watchers for me!! BTW-I dos lose 6 pounds in 2 weeks but not worth the side effects!!""",3
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Started Saxenda nearly 3 weeks ago.NO change in hunger levels. I started at 123kg and am still there.I have no other symptoms ie cholestrol/hormones in range, blood pressure is always spot on.There are days where I&#039;m not hungry but I cannot put this down to the drug and then most days where the hunger is ridiculous.I rang my GP and told her this.She said to keep going. She asked if Saxenda have been in touch with me - answer no even though I have registered -there is supposed to be support network. Will keep going until reach the full dose but if nothing happens will ditch it but will call my GP to let her know what I am doing.Good luck to everyone finds this drug works for you.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I was on Adipex for 1 year and lost a lot of weight. Before I started this I was 220lbs. When I was done my weight was 160lbs. I lost more inches then I could believe, I went from a size 22 to a size 14. The medicine works. The only thing I don&#039;t like is once I was off the medicine I gained my weight back quick and had a lot of side effects such as depression, moody, cravings, couldn&#039;t sleep at night, headaches. I went through the side effects for about 4 months after I was off the pill.""",3
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have been taking ambien or zolphidem for almost 15 years. I had horrible insomnia where I couldn&#039;t sleep sometimes at all during the night. The insomnia went on for about 2 years before I tried ambien. it worked immediately.  I don&#039;t take it every night and when I do I break off a third of the pill. The only side effect is sometimes grogginess in the morning. I worry about a little memory loss. I was told it disrupts your REM sleep which can affect memory. Trying to get off completely but don&#039;t want to go through that horrible insomnia again.""",0
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed 10 mg Lexapro in March of 2009 for anxiety. It worked well as far as the anxiety was concerned but I decided to stop taking it in April 2010 because of the side effects--weight gain (I gained about 10 pounds even though I was a consistent gym rat and my diet did not change) and a pretty much non existent libido. This is NOT A MEDICINE YOU CAN JUST STOP TAKING. My doctor weaned me off by having me take 5 mg everyday for 2 weeks and then 5 mg every other day for a week. The withdrawl symptoms were not bad until I stopped taking it all together. I&#039;ve noticed I&#039;ve been easily fatigued and have constant dizziness, which seems to be worse in the mornings--hopefully it will subside soon.""",7
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""I was put on Abilify a month ago. I have always been manic/ depressive. I suffered post traumatic stress in Iraq in 2007. {I said NOTHING and am still serving as a National Guardsman}. I work law enforcement during the week. I USED to sleep all day on my first day off, it was a struggle to do ANYTHING on my second day off. Since I have been on Abilify my life has done a 180 degree turn. I feel so much better. I get up and face the world every morning at 6-8 am. I feel like a new person.""",5
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I have degenerative disc disease. Medication works well. I have been on it for a year now with my oxycodone. It works miracles, I can go to work everyday and support my family ans when I come home I can actually enjoy the daily activities with my children, I once could not have thought of doing. I am so glad my life is back and am so grateful for a great doctor who after years found a way to put me back on my feet.""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""It has almost been two weeks since I started taking this. It was a rough first three days but after I hung in there, I started to notice some changes.  Today is day 12 and I came to work.  My boss gave me chocolate, and there were homemade treats in the break room.  Not only did I not taste them or eat them, I didn&#039;t even want to.  That has never happened.  I hope this trend continues but only time will tell.""",2
Adderall,ADHD,"""I too have gone through my whole life with undiagnosed ADHD and I have to say that I have lost so many years of my life both academically and personal. I&#039;ve been recently diagnosed with ADHD and started Ritalin. I could not tolerate Ritalin. It made me feel like a zombie along with bad headaches. My MD switched me to Adderall and It has changed my life. I wish I would have sought help years ago but I was too embarrassed to seek mental health help. I&#039;ve been on 30 mg per day of Adderall for 1.5 months now and its worked great except that I think this dose is too low as I have to split the 30 mg into two doses per day. 20 mg works great for me but the other 10 mg I have to take doesn&#039;t do much for me.""",1
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Thank you to those of you that mentioned that Belviq takes more than a few days to reach peak performance. I guess when you think about it, since it works on serotonin, most medications like that take a couple of weeks to start really working.  I was on it 4-5 days and was still craving things and was mad. I noticed today when I got up that I was not wanting to eat until like 1:30 pm.
If you can say anymore about that, it would be helpful. thanks""",3
Quillivant XR,ADHD,"""This has been the best medication for my 10-yr old son, both in how it works and the fact that it&#039;s a liquid. He has severe ADHD. He can&#039;t swallow pills and the patch gave him a rash. He had tried a few capsule meds opened up &amp; the extended release bead mixed in pudding. As soon as this came out, we switched him to Quillivant and he&#039;s had great success in managing his ADHD during the day. He starts having trouble at school around 1pm, so it does wear off somewhat, but overall we have been impressed with this medication. I will second the other reviewer&#039;s comment that you should get the Copay card from your prescriber that is given to them by the manufacturer so it only costs $20/month. You can get a new one each calendar year.""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""5th month on Vyvanse 30 mg which is on the lower dose end. This med has an awful crash. I exercise 4-6x a week. I eat very healthy. I stay busy. I read so many reviews about the same issue. I did reading about the &quot;minimal&quot; crash felt on this med and it is so scary how pharmaceutical companies try to set the med apart. 
For me it lasts 6 hrs and irritability increases. I think it&#039;s in-part tolerance. Mid afternoon, I get severely irritable, anxious, moody, sleepy, and agitated. It is so uncomfortable, I&#039;m supposed to &quot;up&quot; my dose now...to see it last longer and my &quot;crash&quot; will start later&quot;? """,1
Prozac,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking prozac for three months now and I&#039;m the best I&#039;ve ever been. I can see the beauty in the world that I saw when I was little. I don&#039;t think bad thoughts anymore. Sometimes I miss a few days on my medication and I&#039;ll see something like a road or a song or an old diary entry from my journal and it will be a subtle reminder of how I felt but I am strong enough to fight those thoughts and push them away. I smile more and I talk to people. I&#039;m not scared to talk to people in public anymore. My anxiety is almost gone. I dont feel depressed anymore and I love myself. I don&#039;t hate myself anymore. I&#039;ve gotten distracted by how beautiful and amazing I can be that I don&#039;t think about flaws or imperfections. I feel great. Prozac is a miracle""",5
Concerta,ADHD,"""Our 10 year old daughter has been taking Concerta for ADD for two months and the difference is unbelievable.  Her performance in school had been steadily declining from year to year without any explanation.  We knew she was capable of doing well so we found this very frustrating.  After asking the school for help she was evaluated and diagnosed with ADD (no hyperactivity).  She is on a 36mg dose after increasing it just one time.  After starting the medication we noticed a difference immediately, the first thing being her handwriting, it honestly looked like a different child%u2019s writing%u2026so neat I actually thought her older sister had written it.  We%u2019ve received glowing reports from her teachers and even from the principal and her grades have steadily increased to As &amp; Bs in just a short time.  Homework is no longer an issue either%u2026we used to spend long frustrating evenings on homework and now 9 nights out of 10 her homework is completely finished by the time we get home from work.  Thank you Concerta%u2026you gave us the daughter we knew we had.""",1
Strattera,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 26 year old female and been taking Straterra for 2 weeks for ADD and I love it. Straterra has been a miracle for me. Before I would start projects and never finish them but now I finish them. I&#039;m actually happy instead of being down on myself and staying frustrated all the time my husband says I smile and laugh a lot more. I am experiencing some of the side effects, dry mouth, chills weight loss and I don&#039;t eat near as much but I needed to lose weight and ate to much before taking the drug. I just hope this medicine continues to work for me because so far its awesome.""",1
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had liletta for almost 3 months now and I&#039;m loving it.  I was nervous to get it put in because I have a low pain tolerance and it did hurt a lot for about a minute when they were positioning it.  The planned parenthood nurses were very nice and let me lay down for about 15 minutes after the procedure and then I took the bus home.  For about an hour after I had horrible cramps, but then I had period-like cramps for the rest of the day.  Since I had a week left on my pill pack, they told me to finish it because liletta isn&#039;t 100% effective until 5 days later.  After I finished the birth control pills, I had my period for 8 days, which is about twice as long as it usually is.  But my next period was only 3 days and very light""",8
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed with bi polar in 12/28/2015.. It has been very hard from then until now. I first was on lithium it didn&#039;t work for me. I was still maniac. I switched doctors and was put on lithium. My doctor called it the Mercedes of meds.. So I went with it.  It took 4 months to see a difference.. I had to takes meds faithfully.  9 months and Latuda has changed my life. I did gain weight. Now I&#039;m working out on getting it off..""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This is my second post...I started on 3/6/14 and today 4/16/14, I have lost 22 pounds. It could have been more if I just got myself back in the gym. My daily meals consists of breakfast - one egg w/cheese and one turkey link, no lunch around 2pm I have yogurt and BelVita crackers &amp; dinner - whatever I want but no bread and I don&#039;t eat after 7:30pm. Also, I do not take the pill over the weekend! Good Luck everyone!""",3
Fentanyl,Pain,"""I have been using the Fentanyl patch for about 10 days now (50mcg), and it works very well. I also use Norco 10/325 for breakthrough pain. I was previously on MS-Contin 45mg/3 x per day with Norco for breakthrough pain, and it didn&#039;t work half as good as the patch. I have adhesive arachnoiditis, and the Fentanyl patch has been the only medicine that allows me to walk around the house.  I was bedridden otherwise.  The only issue I have with it is the medicine doesn&#039;t seem to last the whole 72 hrs, only about 64 hrs.  I place the patch on the side of my abdomen, where movement is minimal, and it seems to stay in place better than on my arm or anywhere else.""",9
Qsymia,Obesity,"""This is a miracle drug. I&#039;ve been on Qsymia a year now. I went from 189 down to 152.  I&#039;m a fairly active 60 yr. old female but I don&#039;t diet or exercise.  I don&#039;t have time. I know, I know, I Don&#039;t wanna hear it, it&#039;s just the way it is. I&#039;ve had no side effects. With my coupon and insurance I&#039;ve paid $50.00 a month. I can tell you I was eating well above that :(.  I love this med. With summer coming I anticipating losing probably another 10 pounds.""",2
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""Although reading the possible side effects can be scary, this medicine gave me my life back. I had a little hair loss, at doses above 1000mg, but it&#039;s been great in stabilizing my mood swings. If I go off of it, I have an episode within a month. I had no weight gain (actually lost weight I had gained from taking Seroquel previously). I take it with Wellbutrin SR and a little Abilify.  But the Depakote is by far the most effective. I&#039;ve been on it for over 3 years.""",6
Cymbalta,Depression,"""A life saver. Stopped working after 5 months but I am fascinated how this medicine got me out of severe depression. I was praying to die every night even I am an agnostic. I was that desperate. I don&#039;t now it&#039;s still beneficial but I take 60 mg just to be cautious. I was up to 120 mg. With Cymbalta now I&#039;m on 54 mg Concerta (wish to take Adderall but not legitimate in my country), 200 mg Lamictal and 5 mg Xanax(built up tolerance) if need be. Still in depression but not bad as the past years. If you have major depression at least give this medicine a chance.""",5
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have been taking trazodone for over 7 years. Was prescribed for insomnia and as long as I take it, it&#039;s fantastic. Sleep like a baby. Takes about an hour for it to work and will cause nausea on an empty stomach. If I don&#039;t go to bed within an hour of taking this medicine, I will be staggering around running into walls, furniture, etc.  Tried many different sleep meds and this one was the only one that worked for me. I believe it has also provided benefits with treatment for depression and anxiety, although never formally diagnosed.""",0
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started Latuda about a month ago. Its hard to know if is truly working because I am trying to come off of 300 mg of Seroquel. Whoever wrote Latuda made them restless, this happened to me too so my doctor gave me Cogentin and it worked. I&#039;m still hungry all the time but once I&#039;m off Seroquel I shouldn&#039;t be. I also take Vyvanse, Lorazepam, Restoril, and Keppra which is for my seizure disorder. I say Latuda is an 8 so far my paranoia is gone.""",6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I have been suffering from insomnia caused by  from PTSD after giving birth to my baby girl 7 months ago.  The insomnia started 3 months in and I tried Ambien and Trazadone.  Both managed to barely carve out a few hours of bad sleep a night.  Belsomra gave me my life back.  I am finally able to go asleep and actually stay asleep for a full 7-8 hours a night.  I do still have to take 50mg Trazadone with 10mg Belsomra.  It&#039;s the best combination ever.  The sleep is so gentle and natural too and if I have to wake up to use the restroom, no problem and I go back to sleep.  The first 2 days I did have the hangover pretty badly, but it went away after that.  It has only been 2 weeks so fingers crossed it will keep working.""",0
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have CRPS in my left foot. I have a spinal cord stimulator (paddle leads). I have been on pain meds since 7/2013 after an accident. Meds tried through prescription from pain mgmt. Norco, Percocet, Oxycontin, Morphine ER, Butrans and more. Nucynta was prescribed April, 2015. I took it for 1 week. I am a very positive person who is always seeing the good in any situation. Nucynta made me depressed, moody, not wanting to get out of bed, quiet and overall someone I do not want to be. It did aid in my pain control, but I cannot be that person is made me. After being off of it for 2 days, I am back to being my positive self.
Would I recommend it? I don&#039;t think so.""",9
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had nexplanon in for a little over a year now. I absolutely love it!!! I actually experienced weight loss but that is probably due to new workout regiment and diet plan. Periods are all over the place but I&#039;ve had maybe 4 in the past year and the only long one was probably due to a reaction with an antibiotic I was on. They were all super light.  I think it&#039;s the best thing since sliced bread.""",8
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""Latuda is the first antipsychotic I&#039;ve taken, and I have to say it works. Yeah nausea sets in if you don&#039;t eat with it but it&#039;s been pretty fine. Started with 20 MG for the past 6 months, and auditory hallucinations diminished at least 90%. Anxiety about 60% which is why I&#039;m looking to up my dosage to 40mg along with upping my zoloft dosage to 100mg.But with any medicine there are side effects and diarrhea is an issue with this medication. So, with my uptake in dosage hopefully I&#039;ll be all the way me again.""",6
Morphine,Pain,"""I have been taking Kadian for about two years and it has been the only medicine that can manage my chronic pain. I was also taking several Vicodin daily prior to the use of Kadian.  Now I only take a Vicodin once in a while. I also have an implant in my spine for pain control but need Kadian as well.  I take 30mg once a day, at night.  When I don&#039;t take this medicine, I can not walk without a cane, so it also helps my mobility.""",9
Vistaril,Anxiety,"""I have weened off of Effexor 150mg and 75 mg over the past 3 weeks. I started Cymbalta 30 mg 2 days ago and was still have horrible adverse effects coming off of the Effexor. Effexor worked great for my anxiety and severe PMDD, but was making me extremely sluggish. I have also had chronic back pain for the past 7 years and my doctor wanted to switch me to Cymbalta. Well, the transition/withdrawal has been terrible. A lot if crying and panicking for no reason, crawling skin, etc. I took one Vistaril, and found it very helpful.  My Dr. has prescribed Vistaril 25-50 mg every 6 hours as needed. Has been a God send to help my anxiety during this transition. It also has been very helpful for my sons anxiety as well.""",7
Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo,Birth Control,"""I was on this pill for a little more than one year before I switched to an IUD (mirena)

Pros:
-regular, short, predictable periods with little to no PMS
-clear skin
-went up a cup size (B to C)

Cons:
-increased vaginal discharge and odor
-weight gain (20lbs) with little to no change in diet/exercise 
-moodiness/days of low energy 

I might have stayed on this pill because of the regular periods and clear acne, but the weight gain made me self conscious and a break from daily pills (with IUD) was appealing.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking phentermine March 26(Monday), 2012. My first weigh in was 227lbs. I get up at 6:30 am every morning and take it first thing along with chromium picolinate. I do 30mins of body weight training and cardio 4x a week. I only eat 2x a day, usually post workout and grilled chicken, rice and veggies for dinner. I have ice water all the time. I also try to stay moving even after I work out. I did get the dry mouth, but I keep water in hand. I don&#039;t have trouble going to sleep, but have woken up several times a night. Today is Sunday April 1, 2012 and I&#039;m at 217lbs now. That&#039;s 10lbs in 6 days! The pill does work, but not by itself. If you want fast results, you have to work for it. """,3
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""The best medication I&#039;ve taken thus far for anxiety. I&#039;m on 60 mg/day split into two doses of 30. Non addicting, no sexual side effects, in fact this is amazingly free of any side effects that I have experienced. I have been on Klonopin in the past and overall I have to say that this has been the best for my anxiety and social phobia. The medical community is all too quick to disregard this medicine as ineffective. Its a safe medicine. You&#039;re not losing anything by at least giving it a trial. Its the only med that&#039;s worked well for me after trying countless SSRIs, and a few psych meds of other classes. Good luck.""",7
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""OMG! I tried Belsomra for the first time after several years of taken ambien. My doctor told me to try it so I could get off the ambien. Well the first 10 minutes after taken, it I got a horrible and quick pain on the left side of my brain..it was so bad I let out a loud OUCH!  I did not get sleep was up all night and the next day  I did not have to work. My behavior was like someone with narcolepsy up and down all day.  Now I don&#039;t know if this has anything to do with it but I hadn&#039;t had a cold or cold like symptoms in 10 yrs and after taken Belsomra for 1 day I got sick.  I will never take Belsomra again.  I will go back to ambien.  I contacted the FDA and told them about my side affects.""",0
Intuniv,ADHD,"""I started intuniv when I was 11 almost 12 and those first 6 months were hell, I would sleep from the time I got home from school so 3 p.m. until 6 a.m. the next morning and WAS STILL TIRED! I would fall asleep in class or on the bus it was miserable. We told the doctor and she said well just push through it and push through the tiredness, might I add if you were ever on this medicine it is not a tired you can just push through. But I tried to anyways for the next year or so and I would not sleep everyday as much but there were some days where I would sleep the entire days away! It did get better but I would still fall asleep in class and be exhausted constantly!! FINALLY when I was 15 the dr took me off of that and its been so wonderful!!!""",1
Bupropion,Anxiety,"""Diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder &amp; GAD, I started taking this medication at 150mg. After 4-5 weeks of dry mouth, headaches, night sweats, abnormal dreams, and a slight head jerk every now and then, my anxiety had almost disappeared. I lost 10 lbs the first 2 months but eventually gained it back which I didn&#039;t mind. WB has made a huge difference with the physiological symptoms of my anxiety, meaning that I no longer feel physically uncomfortable, especially in social situations. My doc has increased my dosage to 300mg after being on 150mg for 8 months. So far after one week on the new dosage, all the initial side effects I had when I first started taking WB have returned, but with the addition of dry eyes &amp; blurred vision.""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""Since I was a teenager I have been struggling with Insomnia. So I was sent to a Psychiatrist who was fairly old. So as he prescribed Xanax and Valium for me in the day time. He gave me Amytal (amobarbital) 200mg Capsules for insomnia. These work more than you can believe. However as there wasn&#039;t a huge demand for it it was taken off the market, and I was put on Restoril 30mg x 2, 
didn&#039;t work. Ambien in my opinion is the best they have on the market right now. """,0
Indomethacin,Pain,"""I would like to say that I went to the E.R and they couldn&#039;t find out why I was having the chest pains also PE (pulmonary embolism) had been ruled out. Every time I took a breath it was so painful they were giving me morphine every hour the pain would not subside, so I went to my primary care physician and he diagnosed me with pleurisy which is a inflammation of the lining of your lungs so he prescribed Indocin for me and after one day I started getting serious relief.""",9
Lexapro,Depression,"""I used this page for support when I first started out on Lexapro so I thought I&#039;d give back. I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg for dysthymia (mild chronic depression) and anxiety. The first few weeks were accompanied by a persistent mild headache and some nausea. I was much more tired - slept 8-hour nights plus an afternoon nap. 10 days into my prescription I was at the beach and I noticed some people&#039;s swimsuits appeared to have brighter colours. The world slowly began to appear more vivid visually and to have more &quot;depth&quot;. At some point rumination stopped almost completely. Two months in, the world seems much more inviting and much less harsh than it used to. 
This drug works for me.""",5
Sertraline,Depression,"""I was recently giving this in addition to wellbutrin to help with anxiety and depression. I was to take 25 mg a day for 4 days then move up to 50. right off the bat I noticed that this made me tired but when I took the 50mg dose my stomach got upset and I threw up about an hour later. Slept a long time. I woke up and felt some of the worse depression I had felt in months. I felt extremely tired, no appetite, angry, no drive, foggy headed. I&#039;ve never had any success with basic ssri&#039;s. I was prescribed this medication over 10 years ago. It was a failure then and it is a failure now. The only AD I can seem to tolerate is wellbutrin. I don&#039;t see the doc for a while until then I will be using other tools to combat my depression.""",5
Monodox,Acne,"""Low self esteem, not wanting to leave the house, not being able to stay in a relationship because I was so self conscious and miserable, always walking with my head down, couldn&#039;t look people in the face, couldn&#039;t walk out the house without makeup (although it didn&#039;t cover the bumps). I cried almost everyday and hated my life. 

It all changed in 5 months. I&#039;ve never seen my face so clear. I&#039;m finally getting my confidence back. Yes it did take some time for the results to fully kick in, but it did work for me and I&#039;m so happy I finally went to the dermatologist after trying a million and one products that never worked; changed my entire diet and drank water and it never work. But Monodox along with Ziana gel definitely changed my life.""",4
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on Belviq for months. I&#039;ve had no side effects. I started at 250 and am currently about 218. I didn&#039;t want much in terms of food in the beginning but I find myself eating more now. Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;ve added a daily 3 mile walk. Maybe I&#039;m just hitting a plateau. But I&#039;m not gaining. Happy to be down 30 but would like another 50. Slow and steady! But feel much better!""",3
Accutane,Acne,"""ACCUTANE IS THE ANSWER. I took Accutane when I was 18. I had suffered with extremely severe acne since I was 11. Accutane was a miracle. It completely cleared my skin within 4 months with minimal side affects. I did have dry skin and pretty chapped lips for 4 months but for clear skin, it was a price I was willing to pay. Think carefully before taking this medicine due to the severe side effects that some people experience, but for me it was 100% worth it. I am now 21 and have had clear skin ever since. I can remember reading about Accutane before taking it and hoping it would be the solution I had been praying for. To this day, I am very grateful for the impact it has had on my life. I would give it a chance!""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I had results taking phentermine; I immediately had energy and felt like my old self again, as I had been recuperating from a joint replacement and had put on nearly 25 lbs!  The weight came off slowly, about 2-3 lbs a week at first. By the 5th-6th week, I noticed I had lost 12 pounds. I&#039;m now into my 8th week and have lost a total of 17 lbs. I really feel phentermine boosted my metabolism, which has always been slow, as well, as I have not been able to do much exercising due to the surgery. Hopefully I can continue taking phentermine so I can reach my goal to lose 30 lbs.""",3
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I have had a great experience with Sandexa. My doctor is the best in the world too and monitors me very closely.  I have lost 26 pounds so far and now fitting into clothes I have been able to wear for over nine years.  I have had a little bit of constipation but I take a stool softener every other day and I am fine.  I am working with my doctor to ensure I do not get high blood pressure or diabetes because I already have kidney problems.   Great medication and thanks so much to my doctor for recommending it.""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hello this is a follow up, I posted on here on 1-17-12 while I was at a 44 lbs total weight loss. I did stop taking this medication for a month so I could get full effect again. I started back on it about a week ago. I wanted to note that I did not gain anything back on the month I was off of it. And my eating habits were easy to keep. Also as of today I am at 230 lbs. Now at a total weight loss of 53 lbs. Still loving it.""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got my Implanon on 4/21/11.  The only pain I felt during insertion was the numbing shot, but that only lasted for maybe 20 seconds or less.  After that, absolutely no pain during the rest of the insertion.  Now looking at the insertion site, there is a bruise, but it&#039;s not terrible, and the insertion site looks no bigger than the width of a nickel!  My arm was numb for the rest of that day, and I have had practically no pain ever since.  It&#039;s a little tender to the touch, but nothing to complain about.  I haven&#039;t had to take any pain medication for it.  I got the Implanon inserted towards the end of my period. My period stopped and have had no bleeding as of yet. It is pretty soon after the fact, but I am very happy with my decision!""",8
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have had sleep issues because of major anxiety and depression for over 10  years. It affected both falling asleep and staying asleep through the night. I tried other medications and then was put on Trazodone by my psych doctor. I take 150 mgs about a half hour to an hour before I go to bed and do not have to eat anything with it. (Someone had posted that they were concerned about that issue. I believe that is suggested for people who are on it daily for depression, not insomnia).  Trazodone puts me to sleep minutes after I get into bed, and I sleep soundly until the alarm goes off.""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;m nearing my 3rd weeks and I feel my cravings have increased. I take one in the AM and one in the PM. I am always hungry which wasn&#039;t the case before staring this medication. The first week I had a severe headache that awakened me at 4 AM for 5 days in a row. Week 2 I am very sleepy which actually helps because I&#039;m in bed by 10:30 PM where as before I&#039;d be up until after midnight. 
I&#039;ll report back after week 3 to advise if there&#039;s been any improvements.""",2
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I have been on Doxycycline for 7 and a half weeks.  It says it takes 6-8 weeks to work and that is absolutely true.  I still have acne right now but its definitely clearing up in this week.  I made the mistake of touching my face a lot and picking at my acne which will not help it clear up.  I am taking one tablet of doxycycline 100mg a day with Clearasil foam wash twice a day with Aczone in the morning and Epiduo at night.  Just be patient and it will work in 6-8 weeks.""",4
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I was on Effexor XR for 8 years and I recently went off. I gave the drug 8 out of 10 because overall my anxiety and depression were greatly improved. I didn&#039;t have any sexual side effects and only felt dizzy when I did not take the medication at exactly the same time every night. I did lose a lot of my energy and was prescribed Wellbutrin to help out with that. However, the withdrawal, as others have mentioned, is terrible. My doctor prescribed a low dose of prozac (20mg) to ease the withdrawal and it really helped. If you are going off effexor, do it with prozac. I tried without it twice before and it was such a horrible experience that I went right back on.""",5
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""My pain specialist recommended this and after reading reviews I was so reluctant to take it, however I tried it and yes it did work 20mins later. I found myself relaxed, it was like I took a valium but when I woke up my heart rate was so low which wasn&#039;t normal for me. My HR is usually 65-80 but when I woke up I had a irregular heart beat of 43bpm. I thought I was going to have a panic attack cos of a sunken feeling in my chest. 
I suffer with PTSD, depression, anxiety and have CRPS so I do take 8 meds when necessary. Will I continue taking 2mg melatonin? No, unless the blood test shows ur &quot;lacking melatonin&quot; I wouldn&#039;t recommend this. The number of complaints is quite alarming to me.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking adipex on 11/14-4/15 and without diet and exercise I instantly lost 25 lbs. I weighed 150lb (only being 5&#039;2) , by the end of the first month I was down to 126lb , my goal being 125lb. I stopped for a while and ended up gaining all but 3lbs back. Now I am back on it and I&#039;m excited to see where I&#039;ll be a month from now. The side effects I have had both times is dry mouth, shakes, and short temper.

The medicine does cause dry mouth, but after taking it for sometime it doesn&#039;t seem to bother me. I gained most of my weight after having my daughter who is now 4 years old. I decided to change my eating habits before taking the Phentermine. It has become a lot easier that way. My goal weight is 185. I will keep everyone posted as I continue this weight loss journey.""",3
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am 18 years old and just graduated high school, all of my life I have had issues with going to school and getting things done. Always had great grades the first months of the school year then they would drop to C&#039;s, D&#039;s or failing. I was put on Vyvanse 1 day before my 18th birthday and it completely changed my life. Not only am I a much happier person, but I actually take interest in things and like finishing things I start! I have noticed some weight loss, but my appetite is and always will be still there. I&#039;d really love to thank whoever discovered the wonderful prescription Vyvanse!""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on this medicine for about 2 months. My side effects were headache, thirsty, tired and wired. Felt kind of like I was stoned, constipation, insomnia. Most of the side effects went away after I got to the full dosage. Still a headache occasionally. And still feel wired sometimes. But I haven&#039;t lost any weight. I know it&#039;s a slow working pill but nothing. In 2 months. It has curbed my appetite and cravings. But no weight loss is frustrating.""",2
Klonopin,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Klonopin for over 6 yrs now.  Has been working great. I take it for Bipolar Disorder and Panic Disorder without agoraphobia.  I have had my times off of it, but also experiencing Epilepsy. I usually  have seizures within 48 hrs of being off Klonopin.  Needless to say I&#039;m still taking it (0.5mg tabs 4 times daily).  Works great, and it was the first benzodiazepine I&#039;ve been prescribed and only one that works for me.  I&#039;ve tried Ativan, Xanax, Valium and Restoril. They all work great, but I&#039;ll always prefer Klonopin.""",6
Xanax,Anxiety,"""Dad always had some amount of general anxiety but managed it reasonably.  In approx 1982 he was prescribed Xanax after his Dad died unexpectedly and he was instructed to take X as needed.  He&#039;s been on and off X ever since then and has needed progressively more.  About 20 years ago he &quot;graduated&quot; to other medications including anti-depressants and at one point was on a combo that resulted in a nearly-successful suicide attempt.  He never had suicidal thoughts before or after that particular combo.  He&#039;s now old and his life is in ruins.  He takes X throughout the day but is at the max and cannot take more.  Please be aware once you start on these medications you&#039;re in it for life.  Dr&#039;s know this -- job security for them!""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""This is an update to my previous review. I have now been on Contrave for three months, and in that time I have lost 35 lbs (goal is 130 lbs total). The first two weeks were horrible, then the side effects subsided. When I consciously watch my diet, I lose very steadily. Even if I don&#039;t, I usually lose 2 lbs a week. My life before Contrave was constantly thinking about food, snacking, and looking for the next &quot;fix.&quot; Now I get hungry, but not famished. I can eat when I am hungry and rely on my body to give me cues- before, that was a foreign concept to me. For once, I feel like I am in control and that I can see this through to the end, and get to a healthy weight, which I have never been able to do. If you are obese, consider it.""",2
Escitalopram,Depression,"""My rheumatologist put me on Lexapro for both depression &amp; fibromyalgia, after Cymbalta stopped working for me. I started it two weeks ago Tuesday &amp; I absolutely love what it&#039;s doing for my depression &amp; anxiety but hate that it&#039;s caused me to gain at least 5 lbs already. I&#039;m going to try to stick with it for another 4-6 wks, but if my weight continues to increase, I&#039;ll have to wean off of it. I dread weaning off of antidepressants.""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the skyla IUD about 3 months ago and there are definitely pros and cons. the insertation was painful for maybe a minute then I had constant cramping for about a week but nothing ibuprofen and a heating pad couldn&#039;t take care of. I had spotting for about a month (until after my first period with skyla). My boyfriend and I have not have any problems with it during sex so far. For the last few weeks i have been experiencing major fluctuations with my moods.  I&#039;m not 100% sure if it&#039;s related to the iud but it&#039;s been awful with a lot of crying randomly over dumb things and going from angry to happy and vice versa in a split second, I&#039;m hoping this will resolve and go away soon!""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have just started this medicine today and I am hoping to have positive results. It is an expensive medication as it cost me $118 for a 30 day supply. I figured I will try it for 30 days to see what it does. I am in desperate need of help. I am a 38 year old female that is 5&#039;5 and 294Lbs. I have low thyroid which does not help with motivation and I have lots of back pain that makes it hard to walk any distance. It is probably just in my head because today is just day one but I already feel like my head is in a positive place, I feel motivated and I only ate half my lunch because I felt very content and full. Hoping for positive results!! Good luck to everyone!""",2
Metadate CD,ADHD,"""My son is 7-1/2 and has been taking 20mg of Metadate CD for the past 4 months.  He started a new school this year, private school, and we had high hopes for him to succeed.  But within the first week of school the teacher was already reporting lack of focus and inability to work independently.  So the Doctor recommended a higher dosage.  We had just filled the prescription ($47/month) so I asked if we could simply double the dose instead of a new prescription of 30mg. Doctor was Okay with that so we did it over the weekend.  I saw a major difference at home, he sat in his room and played Lego&#039;s for over 3 hours, very focused on it.  But he was so quiet it scared me.  Today will be his first day in the classroom with 40 mg, I hope it works.""",1
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I had implanon inserted in December of 2009. The first two months I did not get a period but since then I have gotten it every 2 weeks. And it isn&#039;t just spotting, it&#039;s a full period with PMS lasting around 5 days. I talked to my health care provider and was put on Apri along with the Implanon in order to regulate the bleeding which my HCP said should regulate in about a month. Other than this, the only side effects I&#039;ve gotten are increased appetite but with no weight gain and my skin has cleared up.""",8
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I have had crippling lethargic depression. And was sleeping my whole life away. I have been taking methylphenidate for 8 years. I&#039;m very hyper. No bipolar but have had add, ptsd, depression and some hypomania. I think methylphenidate has helped me with all these symptoms. I can focus. Do what needs to get done. Clean my apartment. Not sleep 24/7 anymore. I&#039;m calm. And have a much better life. More energy and I&#039;m happy!""",1
Xanax,Anxiety,"""It&#039;s sad. Ever since I was a child I&#039;ve had anxiety problems and it only seems to get worse with age. I&#039;ve used Xanax for years to help control it, when it feels like I&#039;m going to have a heart attack (racing heart) or I start shaking so bad I can&#039;t even think straight. Xanax worked wonders for me. Now my MD. wants to stop it. I&#039;m on Cymbalta and unfortunately, I find it a very poor substitute. As I find it doesn&#039;t do &#039;The Great Job Xanax Did&#039;. """,7
Pregabalin,Pain,"""Just started Lyrica for extreme pain in my thoracic spine after a workplace injury causing a muscular ligamentous tear of my medial scapula. I tried every sort of pain medication available with absolutely no relief. My Dr. prescribed Lyrica for me a few days ago and about 4 hours after the first dose I noticed a change in my level of pain. Had massive side effects though such as vertigo, dizziness, light headed, blurred vision, etc. I did have a fever though from an unrelated condition so I&#039;m not sure whether it is related to the Lyrica. I have continued taking this medication with the hope that the side effects ease and the pain remains minimal. I&#039;m worried about weight gain that others are talking about. I&#039;ve just lost 25kg, don&#039;t want it back.""",9
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started Latuda about a month ago so far I feel amazing. My negative thoughts (voices in my head) are not gone but more positive and not so attacking. I havnt had any erges in my body to yell scream or cry for no reason. I havnt yet to pop off quick like I did before I have no feeling to even be upset. I&#039;m Feeling as if iv let go of all the bad energy I had inside me. A lot more tired and restless I&#039;m sure I will get more use to it later but it&#039;s help me not wake up in a panic like I did everyday before. I would truly recommend to anyone who just wants to figure out who they truly are somone who wants consistency with there self If that makes sense? I love the person I am now and I hope to keep feeling this way. Good luck""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I recently had my second Mirena inserted. I had my first one for 6 years. I had a little bit of spotting for the last year or so, perhaps due to the hormones reducing.  I had gained almost 60 pounds since my first insertion. But it was gradual and I never attributed it to the Mirena. I recently went on a low carb diet...started exercising and voila, 40lbs lost in a 3 month period! I guess it wasn&#039;t the Mirena after all. When I got my second one inserted I gained 5 lbs of water overnight and bloated something fierce.  I began to worry, what if I start to gain again? Well I gave it 2 weeks I&#039;m down on the scale lower than ever! I&#039;m a happy Mirena user.""",8
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I am a 29 year old male. I have been overweight pretty much all my life. I started the trial does of Qsymia on 1/16/13 weighing 315lbs.  I did not notice any changes at all in my eating or any side effect after the first few days, so I started to take the regular dose.  Since that time I have lost about 0.5 to 1 pound a day. Today (2/24/13) I weighed in at 286.2lbs.  So almost 30 pounds. I do the elliptical for about 30-35 min a day and I eat about 1500-1800 calories a day.  I know I should eat more, but I am just not that hungry.  No side effects. Hope I am not losing the weight too fast...""",2
Citalopram,Depression,"""I have been using this medicine for 5 weeks. I started on 20mg at night. Physical side effects included excessive sleeping, dizziness on waking (lasting about 2 hours), substantially reduced libido, teeth-grinding and no appetite.  Other side-effects were a feeling of &quot;disconnection&quot; from my emotions, forgetfulness and repeating tasks.  So, whilst the medicine alleviated the depression symptoms, it was impacting substantially on other aspects of my life.  HOWEVER, I revisited my GP and requested a reduction.  I am now on 10mg per day.  The difference is phenomenal - I feel hopeful and able to cope, still don&#039;t have an appetite or &quot;normal&quot; libido but can work round those issues! I guess it&#039;s all about finding the CORRECT dosage for YOU.""",5
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Excellent medication! very effective for insomnia and mild depression.  If you wake up feeling groggy it&#039;s probably because you are taking too much; try half.  I take 25 to 50mg at night, have a restful sleep, and wake up in the morning a bit sleepy but I have some coffee and take a shower and problem solved.  I haven&#039;t felt this good in a long time.  I&#039;ve tried Ambien, Melatonin, Lunesta, Magnesium, Valerian Root to sleep; Zoloft, Fluoxetine, Wellbutrin, and Celexa for depression.  This medication is by far the best I&#039;ve tried for BOTH! Sleep issues and mild depression.  Give it a try!

Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I have been on Klonopin for 20 years. I&#039;ve only had to up the dosage once, from 0.5mg to 1 mg per day. Before I took it I started having uncontrollable panic attacks, loss of appetite, lack of concentration. Klonopin worked instantly. I went from no appetite, to being able to eat normally again. There has only been one short period in my life during those 20 years, when my circumstances were so overwhelming that the panic attacks re-occurred, and I would sometimes take an extra dose. This medicine has been a life saver for me. In all those years I have only lost 2 days of work because of anxiety related illness. I thank the doctor who put me on this and who keeps monitoring me to see that I am OK.""",7
Solodyn,Acne,"""I am over 40 with adult acne for years. I had it under control with epidue for years but something hormonal happened and I had a severe break out and it was bad. My dermatologist started me solodyn 105mg. It worked immediately. My acne cleared up and my face was smooth again. But my only side affect is I have gotten really dark, I haven&#039;t read anyone complaints about getting dark so I would  like some responses to my post. I don&#039;t know if its because I am a black woman.  But after reading some of the posts I will start taking a lesser dose to see if that helps.""",4
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""Restoril really helped me sleep.  Sleeplessness was the cause of fibromyalgia for me and my rheumatologist prescribed it and I was able to sleep and deal with physical pain. What he did not tell me at all was the potential dangers of it. DO NOT drink and take it. You could die because it can cause your respiratory system to shut down.  If you have taken it a long time, DO NOT wean yourself off abruptly.  You could have seizures.  I am being slowly weaned off of it by a doctor who is alternating dosages from 15 mg. to 30 mg. per night. I plan on giving myself plenty of time to get off of it.  Be careful which medicines you use with it such as anti-inflammatories. They can increase the effects of the medicine without your expecting it.""",0
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started off on the highest mg which is 37.5 and it has worked very well for me. In my first month I had lost 26lbs and in 6 months, I lost a total of 90lbs. I DID NOT EAT HEALTHY NOR DID I EXERCISE. I took a break from it a couple of months back because it&#039;s not safe to take it for an extended period of time due to the fact that it takes a toll on your liver. I just got back on it again yesterday. It will cause you to have DRY MOUTH, CONSTIPATION, URGES TO DRINK LOTS OF WATER, ENERGY, ABILITY TO STAY FOCUSED, INSOMNIA, FAST HEART RATE, MOOD SWINGS, NAUSEA AND EASES BODY PAIN. I have a heart murmur and panic attacks so after taking this medication, I notice it gets harder for me to breath as the day goes by.""",3
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I have taken Strattera for almost 5 years now and its a wonder drug for me personally.  Without this drug my mind really really races and I can help it with exercise and things like that to get the energy out, but I&#039;m not on the same beat as others.  When I take Strattera, everything slows down and I&#039;m on the same beat and wavelength as everyone else.  Social conversations go better and I&#039;m able to stay on task with work and actually get things done.

I&#039;ve found taking it on an empty stomach can be bit sickening, but other than that no downsides for me.  I take 40 mg 1 or 2x a day as needed and find it wears off in 6-8 hours for me.

I&#039;m extremely ADHD but have no depression at all, very happy person always have been.""",1
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""It helps out tremendously with my anxiety. For some reason I get extremely vivid nightmares. What is strange about the nightmares is that they always have the same setting as where I am sleeping. Also, when I have the nightmares after A short period of them starting , It&#039;s almost like I realise it&#039;s just a dream and I convert into a mode of half asleep, half awake. I&#039;ll be having the nightmare but I realise it&#039;s not real and try to wake my self up but at the same time I&#039;m trying to wake up in my dream I feel like im trying so hard to move to open my eyes but I can&#039;t. Almost like a paralyzed state of being but than I wake up usually after the first nightmare they stop. But, not always. Has anybody else experienced this side effect?""",7
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda last July 2016. In the first two months I lost 4% of my body weight. After that, it stopped. I continued on for another two months, with no change. The information that comes with the drug says to stop taking if there is no change after 4%. I did stop. The weight came back on. I spoke with my doctor in December, and she encouraged me to start again.

One side affect I&#039;ve had, other than some mild nausea, is red itchy welts at the injection sites, when I start on the 1.2 mg and higher doses. The itchiness was intense. Started taking Benedryll, which  helped. In time, the itchiness reduced, but still get red marks.

Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""Before I explain, let me start off by saying; I do not take meds, not even for a headache.. this is a very rare circumstance. My Dr knows this and will ask me if I&#039;m going to fill the prescription as to not waste either of our time. I usually say no and we discuss non medicinal ways to cope. 
This time I said yes and got .5mg lorazepam and in the 3 days I&#039;ve taken them I&#039;m more anxious!""",7
Topamax,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started on this medicine in 2004. It has been a roller-coaster ride. The first, and most immediate thing was I stopped smoking, and discontinued drinking anything carbonated. I rapidly lost about 30lbs, my nails became so thin I could not hold paper. I started taking supplements as the weight loss, caused nutrition loss. Tingling in hands and feet still persist, especially when I am cold. Around 2007 I entered into a psychotic break, there are other contributing factors here, so my doctor took down the dose from 200mg to 75mg where I am still at today. I have regained some weight, but that is due to another medicine that I now take with this.""",6
Intuniv,ADHD,"""We have had much success with our 11 year old on this medication.  He is conversing with us more and stays better focused on the task at hand (i.e. school work). He is not as easily frustrated by things and has started sharing his feelings which he never did before.  He started on the Tenex in August 2009 and we switched to the Intuniv about two months ago.  Tenex helped but Intuniv seems to have really done the trick.  We still have some issues, but everything is more tolerable for both him and us!""",1
Dapsone,Acne,"""I&#039;m a 20 year old female who&#039;s been battling moderate to severe acne since middle school. I&#039;ve been wearing hypoallergenic Almay makeup since I was 12 because I was so self conscious of my skin. After unsuccessfully fighting it on my own, I went to a dermatologist who put me on Oracea to take in the morning and Aczone to apply at night. It&#039;s only been a week but I have had zero breakouts! The pimples I had prior to this have vanished and my dark spots are fading. I use Aczone at night after washing my face with Neutrogena acne prone skin soap (also recommended by my dermotologist). It has made my skin a little dry, but it used to be so oily that it seems to have balanced things out. Hopefully it will continue to work!""",4
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got the implant in on June 8th of this year, and my experience so far has been fantastic! Getting the implant was a little nerve racking, but it wasn&#039;t as bad as i thought. It hurt a little bit but nothing intolerable. It was quite sore for the next few days or week. I had a fairly large bruise, but it wasn&#039;t that bad. I got the implant put in on the last day of my period and I haven&#039;t gotten it since nor have I gotten any cramps. No spotting or anything. I couldn&#039;t tell you if I had gained weight from it, since not to long after I had surgery which caused me to gain some weight. Not getting my period has worried me a bit, but i&#039;m taking it as a good thing and rolling with it. I would recommend this to anyone willing to give it a shot!""",8
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I am on a trial pack starting from 25 mg with an increases of 15 - 20 mg a week. I am at my second week at 40mg and so for all I feel is the side effects. I found that if I take it on an empty stomach I get extremely nauseous for about and hour or two. I can&#039;t really tell if it&#039;s working yet since I&#039;m only in my second week, but so far I&#039;m not too optimistic. I was on Wellbutrin before and that had little to no effect on me. I don&#039;t feel depressed at all but I will say my anxiety has diminished. As for the ADD I guess will just have to wait and see.""",1
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I had acne since 11 and I&#039;m now 22, but Retin A really helped my get rid of them in 3 months. (I also cut dairy which is what I believe had caused my acne.) I started using retin A at 0.025-&gt;0.05% and I am seeing huge difference in my skin. Pores are significantly smaller as all my friends have complimented on how good my skin looks. Scars are going away faster than they do normally. I didn&#039;t have initial breakout like most people have. There&#039;s only occasional peeling when I don&#039;t drink enough water. I do notice my skin regenerate A LOT faster so remember to gently exfoliate your skin (light med peel). Amazing as it sounds, do give it a few months (or more depending on how your skin reacts to it). Going for 0.1% and I&#039;ll see how it goes!""",4
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal has been a lifesaving mood stabilizer for me. The only serious downside is that it causes what I call &#039;old lady skin&#039;- thin, fragile, and poor healing, as well as mucous membrane fragility. 

I initially did very well on 200 mg and suddenly developed severe rash eight months in (rare for it to take that long). I successfully (and slowly) rechallenged, and 200mg is where the skin issues kick in. I&#039;m back down to 150mg and my slow-healing bug bites from the summer are finally fading away!

HOWEVER, even if I had skin like the Crypt Keeper for the rest of my days, I can&#039;t praise Lamictal enough. It gave me my life back. What&#039;s a little skin in exchange?""",6
Diclofenac,Pain,"""After a series of pain medications and even a course of prednisone to help with my costochondritis, my doctor decided to give this a try before seeking further intensive treatment. This is the first time I&#039;ve had relief from any pain, and while not clearing it completely, it does a pretty good job of reducing it significantly. I&#039;m only worried about prolonged use and haven&#039;t come across reviews regarding that yet. Would greatly appreciate anyone&#039;s view on that as well! Also, there is a coupon for $20 that you can download directly from the website, as this can be pretty expensive. Even with insurance.""",9
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on Abilify for 3 weeks total. On the 3rd day on the drug I started to feel shaky, like something had to be moving at all times. I figured it would just go away so when I got no sleep that night from this I thought tomorrow will be better. But on day 4 it was worse so I called my doctor and he told me to take a half a pill and by this time my legs were visible shaking out of control. I would have to push on them to make them stop. On days 5, 6 and 7 I had the same thing: shakey and no sleep. Everything hurt from the shaking. It was so bad at one point I broke down in the middle of my in laws home. That day my doctor took me off this medicine and 2 days later all the shaking was gone.""",6
Chlordiazepoxide,Anxiety,"""This drug did very little for me. My Doctor prescribed it as an alternative to Xanax until a full clinical work up could be done. As a moderate to heavy drinker, he did not advise me that this is used to pull people from the disease. I don&#039;t feel like I have issues with alcoholism but it really messed me up when mixing the two. Felt stoned or comatosed. Taking the drug sober did almost nothing anyway except when I take 2 or 3 at a time and still it does not release the anxiety I have.""",7

I felt like I couldn&#039;t get the negative thoughts out of my head. Dr prescribed 10mg Lexapro, I got the generic escitalopram. Day 1, I felt like the anxiety was dissipating, but I did have bad nausea and loss of appetite for 12 days. On the 12th day, I woke up, anxiety is gone, nausea is gone, and I am hungry for the first time in a while. I am hopeful that this isn&#039;t just a &#039;good day&#039;, but that the side effects are finally gone. First 12 days were rough.

Yeah, it was really bad. I was embarrassed, I didn&#039;t want my family to even see me. I was ashamed. My mother took me to the dermatologist that Friday and I was prescribed Solodyn. I got two weeks prescription for free. I had an amazing experience so far, its only been a week, exactly a week from today that I&#039;ve been on this medication.($35 for 3 months medication) I don&#039;t regret it at ALL. The only side effect it has had on me is tiredness after school. My acne has cleared about 90% if not more. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with a very ugly acne break out.""",4
Vilazodone,Depression,"""I started taking Viibryd approximately three months ago. It started out rough, lots of side effects, terrible nightmares every night, electric shocks, visual disturbances, nausea and diarrhea, among others.  I continued with the medicine because I have been on well over 15-20 others over the years.  To my surprise after the symptoms alleviated I felt much better, a lot less depressed and generally less hopeless. This lasted only about a month and a half, my body has become tolerant to the medication like every other and now I am in a deeper depression than usual, so I am going back to Wellbutrin.""",5
Accutane,Acne,"""I first took this medicine in high school and was only on it for 2 months because the side effects were so bad.  Now, approx. 4 years later, I&#039;ve now been on it for 4 months.  My side effects are much reduced.  I have experienced dry, peeling lips and dry eyes.  Suspension for 1-2 weeks allowed my lips to heal and I resumed the medication.  This occurred about 3 months in.  After 2 months, after much debate, I did get a tattoo which healed beautifully, quickly, and with no color degradation.  
I highly recommend this medicine only if you have consistently struggled with acne and no other medicine has worked.  Some side effects you just have to tolerate.""",4
Adderall,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 24 years old and have taken Adderall over the course of 10 years. I know the only side effect I couldn&#039;t control is the stunting of my growth. I&#039;m 5&#039;7&quot; and I only grew 1/2 inch in high school. I&#039;m given 90, 30mg monthly. It has always improved my grades, however knowing that tolerance builds I do not take it all the time. Remember you have to take care of your body, especially your heart and liver, because long-term use side effects are still not concisely known.""",1
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I am about to turn 50 and my life of anxiety has been a recent and unpleasant downward spiral. I ended up in the emergency room twice with soaring blood pressure, flushing and heart palpitations plus overwhelming feelings of panic. I live daily with either anxiety or small panic attacks, they are debilitating and have affected my ability to continue work on my degree. After my last ER visit a doc felt I was having panic attacks and directed me to seek help at a Mental Health Clinic. I&#039;ve tried several anti-depressants and I have not tolerated them well. Xanax (0.5 mg) has gotten me through many a day and night and I prefer this medication over all the others. It decreases the anxiety very quickly and helps to maintain a sense of normality.""",7
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Worked amazing for sleep for 5 of the 8 months I took it, and chronic insomnia, when left untreated, is a big trigger for my bipolar.  After the sleep side effect wore off &amp; it failed to do anything for a depressive episode (&amp; had not helped mixed mania episodes earlier), I discontinued it.  But those 5 months of sleep - they felt really natural, not drugged, easy to wake up from if you had to and go back to sleep, and no grogginess in the morning.  Side effects: slight pinky tremor at times, and it made me produce lots of alive - I would drool like a basset hound on my pillow at night.  If you go for this, ask your doc to prescribe the black cherry flavor - I did not find that to be too bad!""",6
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I started the combonation of Tretinoin Cream 0.025, Doxycycline, and Clindamycin Gel on November 2nd. I stopped taking the Doxycycline, and I also stopped applying clindamycin after 5 weeks, and only continued using the Tretinoin Cream. Its now been 13 weeks since then, and the results are worth the wait. The only thing that you have to keep in mind is that it takes a long time to work. I was expecting to see clear skin by 6-8 weeks but I was still purging with new acne by the 10-11th week. Toward the 12th week everything flattened out and now all I have is scarring and hyper pigmentation. But with the continued usage I notice that they are getting lighter. So if you are feeling down about the results wait it out, and it will pay off.""",4
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My 7 year old son has been on Vyvanse for a little over a month.  We have been well pleased with the overall outcome.  He is now able to focus in school and actually sits down and completes his homework without argument. Much calmer in public, unlike before.  Downside, he has lost 4 pounds in a month and becomes very emotional if taken off for the weekend and put back on.  After 1 1/2 months, my son now has developed eye tics.  We have stopped the medication and the eye tics are beginning to subside.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started taking this medicine on 1/1/2016. I actually went to the doctor to ask Dr about Belviq which is another weight loss drug but Dr said it was very expensive and he said that he heard it was not very effective. So today had been 16 days since I started taking Contrave. My starting wight was 253lbs and this morning when I weighed in I weighed 238. Yes that&#039;s 15lbs in 16 days I was super excited. This is just the beginning of my long life journey and I hope it continues to allow this weight to come off. So far this medicine has not had any side effects since I have been taking it . As I continue to lose weight I will give you more updates.""",2
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using adapalene 0.3% for 11 weeks now. I&#039;ve read other users&#039; reviews, &amp; it seems like people tend to negatively rate it due to the irritancy that occurs initially. You should expect irritancy when you first start using this. I&#039;ve experienced flaking, redness, &amp; itchiness, which have mostly subsided now. The right support products help minimize irritancy: a gentle, non-foaming cleanser, moisturizer, &amp; daily SPF are essential. Learn from my mistake: I used an AHA based product to help loosen the flakes, but it only exacerbated the irritation, so I&#039;d recommend avoiding chemical (&amp; physical) exfoliants until your skin seems well-adapted to adapalene. The bottom line: my skin is smooth &amp; acne-free after 11 weeks of use.""",4
Differin,Acne,"""I used Differin gel for almost 2 years on my face. I had moderate acne that no OTC medication helped and some prescription medications didn&#039;t help much either. Differin took about 2-3 weeks of daily use before I saw any change but about 2 months into the treatment my face was pretty much all clear with no pimples. It was amazing. My skin did get red and itchy during those first few weeks but my doctor said it was common and to keep using because my skin would get used to it. It did and it still keeps my skin the best it&#039;s ever looked. Also, it&#039;s now available over the counter at drug stores.""",4
Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking klonopin for several years.  I find it helps more than the short-term benzos like Xanax and Valium.  For one with BPD, Bipolar, and Anxiety Attacks, this pill is a godsend.  I usually do not advocate pharmaceuticals, but I have never had my anxiety quelled like klonopin does.  It is highly effective for any type of anxiety, and stops panic in its tracks after 15-20 mins of administering. This is the only pill that i&#039;m on that I advocate.  The only warning I have is that it has high potential for dependence, and the body gets used to having it constantly.  Sometimes it requires upping the dosage.  PLEASE start on 0.5 mg.  If your dr starts you on 1mg, it will bring on extreme fatigue, and decreased motor function.""",6
Kyleena,Birth Control,"""I had Kyleena inserted today, just 8 hours ago. This was the first IUD I&#039;ve ever had, and I have never been on other birth controls (other than condoms). I&#039;ve never given birth.  I never really had period cramping, so I knew going in that this could be painful. The LPN sounded my uterus, which brought on like 2 mild cramps. Next she told me to take a deep breath in and cough. I panicked and asked &quot;when do I cough?&quot; and at that time she inserted the device. I had maybe 3 or 4 sharpish cramps, but it was not the unbearable pain others have described it as. I had some cramps throughout the day, but mainly in my back. Overall, I would rate today&#039;s pain as a 3/10.""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""My mom died when I was 4 and last semester I always had anxiety in the background and now at 15, spring semester of &#039;08 I had some mild panic attacks and worry, nervousness, sadness and excessive shyness all day long. This medication is a life saver and I love it. They say 8 weeks for the full effect and sure it might re-balance your chemicals in 8 weeks, but give it a chance as it still takes a while after that for you to break out of your shell.""",7
Accutane,Acne,"""My 16 year old son has had acne- not to the point of scaring but enough to really affect his self esteem.
He is now under a specialist and has been taking Accutane for about 3-4 months.40mg per day.
After a month or so his skin was even worse and it was quite horrific but now he is nearly clear !
He has always been very moody and I have constantly been worried that he may have depression.
He has shown NO signs of being any worse on this medication !
Dry, dry, dry lips is the worst side effect and his self esteem is better.""",4
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""As I understand gabapentin, it was originally used to treat seizures but helps to keep you asleep but not necessarily, put you to sleep. My doctor is very wise but also very conservative but felt it is a rather benign drug so added it to my ambien. The combo has been very effective in giving me a full nights sleep. I live in Washington state so was encouraged by my naturopath to try medical marijuana. I take a capsule with THC only (no CBD as its about $5/pill) and it has been a Godsend with no discernible side effects.  I sleep like a baby. I still add about 200 mg gaba to keep me asleep. My only problem with gaba is I have blurred vision the next day. I understand from the fine print that this can be a side effect.""",0
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My 9 yo son was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and has had OT services for 6 months.  We started Intuniv 2 weeks ago. First day on 1 mg he was super hyper, then seemed unchanged.  A week later we went to 2 mg.  It&#039;s great.  He is more focused, less wiggly, finishes task in a more timely manner.  He still squirms but not as much.  His teacher is happy with the improvement.  Side effects-sleepy, dry mouth, emotional.  We have been giving him the pill in the morning.  Around 5pm he gets super sleepy.  The doc told me there is no peak in when the drug works but there is a peak in when the side effects occur.  They tend to be 8-10 hours after taking the drug.  We are going to try giving him the pill at night and see if it helps him with drowsiness.""",1
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed gabapentin for back surgery pain, and nerve pain from diabetes...  I&#039;m on the max dose, 1200 mg 3 times a day... All I can say is thank you Load for freeing me up from the opiates!  My mood is great, I sleep well and my pain has diminished by 75%! I am 63 years old, forced to retire due to excessive back pain (3 surgeries, one spinal fusion) and very bad nerve pain in my feet and hands... I&#039;ve had no side effects and all my doctors (I&#039;ve had triple bypass also... No heart attack, thank God.. No damage to my heart) have said there is no reason to discontinue using it !""",7
Topamax,Obesity,"""Ok so I am going on my third week of topamax I have seizures uncontrollably migraines and obesity so let me begin with saying this I have noticed a significant change in my body as far as the weight loss goes 6pds since I have been on it and still loosing however I have lost my appetite I have no desire to eat I may eat one time a day that&#039;s the only downside I have noticed a change in carbonated drinks they don&#039;t taste the same anymore I am currently coming off tegortol which was only treating my seizures and I was gaining so much weight so I&#039;m thankful that topamax is working for me and i only have to take one pill a day to treat all my ailments""",2
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""After a bit of a rocky start, I must say I&#039;m glad I made this choice. I got the insert after my first pregnancy in November 2016. As I stated it was rough at first. My period was nonexsistant, then it would last for up to 8 days, then it would be basically nothing, but I still had to wear a pad for some spotting. Now almost six months later I have none anymore. I haven&#039;t had any allergic reactions, weight gain, or mood changes. My sex drive if anything has definitely doubled. Over all I&#039;m very happy so far.""",8
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I used to be at a mental state where everyday I would lie on my bed for about 3 hours because I didn&#039;t want to do anything. I had severe suicidal thoughts for 2 years and kept switching medications because they caused weight gain. After about a week of taking the medication my weight started dropping and my grades shot up to b&#039;s instead of c&#039;s. Now I&#039;m doing great. I&#039;ve never had higher grades and haven&#039;t felt this good for years. I&#039;d really recommend it. I haven&#039;t had side effects yet and probably won&#039;t.""",6
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I have been on this drug for about a year. I went up to the highest dose I could (225mg). A year later, I started feeling better. Little did I know, that this drug would give me bad headaches, night terrors, constant over sweating and weight gain. The over sweating is unbearable, if its hot outside, don&#039;t bother wearing make up, it will come right off. You&#039;ll be sweating buckets while no one else has shed a single drop. The weight gain ruined my self esteem as well. If I would have known these side effects, I would have never started it. I am currently going off the drug and I am bracing my self for the days following my dose going to 0mg.""",5
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""So, I feel like this did help stabilize me a little bit (with depressive states), but I ended up getting acne and redness all over my face. I also had my eyes feel all weird and twitchy. Overall, It was not super effective for me because I still had horrible anxiety and panic attacks and I could not titrate high enough to get effective coverage from the medication without weird side effects. I was only on 75mg maximum, mind you.""",6
Roxicodone,Pain,"""This medicine has worked wonders on my chronic back pain. I have tried everything from Tramadol to Opana ER and for the price Roxicodone 30mg tops them all if taken as prescribed, and at the same time each day. The only downfall is that you must take the pills more frequently than say MS Contin or Oxycontin where you only need them every 12 hours. However that was my main problem with the Opana, Oxycontin, Etc., they didn&#039;t seem to last the full 12 hours as advertised. I was lucky if I got a good 8 hours from them.""",9
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""After failed back fusion surgery L4 L5 S1 nothing would touch the pain until Opana ER. I was taking 20 mg three times daily and have cut back to 5 mg 3 times daily with significant pain increase because I thought I was losing my mind. I seem to have built up a tolerance and either need to increase again dramatically or find something else.  Have heard that you can easily build tolerance to Opana.  I am your proof. """,9
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have bipolar 2, BPD, anxiety, and PTSD from past trauma. I have taken many drugs over the years, including 
SSRI&#039;s and lithium carbonate. No medication has help with my anxiety, depression, and mood swings anywhere near as effectively as Lamictal. Within 2 weeks I felt like &quot;myself&quot; again. I felt like a weight had been lifted. My appetite and sleep patterns also became more normalised. I am on 100mg twice a day. And have been for about 6 months. I was ready to give up on medications, then I was but on Lamictal. It was like night and day. It&#039;s hard to describe, honestly. But I feel much for content and happier in general. The only side effect I can remember is when I missed a dose, I got very aggravated and moody. Much love!""",6
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My son is 14 and has tourettes and adhd. He was put on Intuitiv and it has helped with his focus and his tics. At first he was extremely tired, but after taking it for a bit that part is not as bad. The teacher noticed a big improvement. Luckily there have been no other side effects. We started at 1mg and are now on 3 mg. It is my sons choice whether he wants to be on meds or not. He had chose to go off for a bit in the summer and then once back in school he wasn&#039;t doing so great so he chose to go back on it. It really helps with the tics.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My 9 yr old son started vyvanse two weeks ago (lowest dosage) and we saw positive results right away.  In addition to ADHD he has a writing disorder and will literally sit and stare at his paper for hours because he can&#039;t get his thoughts written out.  The first day he tried vyvanse he took it in the morning and then came home from school and without being asked he finished his book (25 pages) and then sat down and wrote a 2.5 page book report!  I have not noticed a change in his appetite and he has only experienced some minor sleep issues but it does not seem to really bother him.  Testing has shown my son to be highly intelligent but his grades do not reflect that - I finally have hope that he can reach his potential!""",1
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I am 16 years old andand I am a junior in highschool I started using the acne cream in 9th grade but I stopped over the summer &amp; was on &amp; off during me 10th grade year(I just lost track) but my overall experience is great I love it my only problem is that after a couple of day my chest gets sorta like a rash &amp; it turns really red &amp; hurts. And my face gets painfully irritated. But I have made an appointment to follow up with my dermatologist so yeah. But overall its a really great cream""",4
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""This is THE best birth control. Ever since I got it I haven&#039;t had one scare nor have I needed to be worried. At first it did really screw with my periods and acne and emotions and I almost had it removed but my doctor said I should keep it for at least a year so my body would have enough time to adjust. Well, it&#039;s been about a year and I am so happy. I no longer bleed when I have my periods. I do still have the emotions and extra breakouts but other than that nothing! The only thing that hasn&#039;t gone away is my acne, it&#039;s actually gotten a little bit worse. I love it anyways and would suggest it to everyone and anyone.""",8
Adapalene,Acne,"""I had a great experience using this product when using the appropriate skin care routine (using harsh products will make your skin peel and burn and can be frustrating even painful) I wanted to share what products works for my sensitive skin (I don&#039;t have any discomfort using differin since)


Clinic take the day off oil balm
fresh soy face cleanser
cotsco kirKlan makeup wipes (only makeup wipes gentle enough for my face)
after putting my eye cream and differin at night I moisturize with seaberry face oil moisturizer from fresh then follow with a lip balm.""",4
Belviq,Obesity,"""I am classified in the BMI category as Obese. I need to lose 90 pounds and since starting Belviq in October of 2016,  I have lost 42 pounds.  I have started working out because I know that just losing the weight was not enough, I needed to get my heart going again.  I have no medical issue,  so it is just about getting the weight off for a healthier me.  It took about 3 weeks for my weight to start dropping and it has been slow. There are times where I will lose weight and then I might go a week and lose nothing.  The main thing is not giving up and getting out their and trying. I can&#039;t run a mile YET, but I can walk it.  Don&#039;t stop trying and don&#039;t give up on Belviq. It really helps.""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""Was prescribed this medication for hormonal acne and started at 100mg daily. This did nothing for me so at my 3 month check up the dermatologist switched me to 150mg daily. This immediately made a huge difference in my skin and within 2 weeks I noticed a reduction in breakouts. I used to break out a lot during my monthly cycle and now I get maybe 1 pimple a month. I also started using a Clarisonic brush to cleanse my skin better.  You have to be patient with this medication as not everyone reacts the same to the same dosage. You and your doctor may have to try different doses before you get it right but once you do it is worth the wait!""",4
Minocycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on this drug once before and it really did help my skin, I only had a little red dots from scarring but my skin was smooth so my doctor told me to have a break from it for 3 months. But when I stopped I started breaking out again and even worse than before so then about 6 months later I&#039;m back on the drug I&#039;ve been on it for about a month now and it hasn&#039;t done anything to my skin, might as well not be taking it at all.""",4
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have tried every AD(H)D pill known so far. I started in grade 4 and went off them in grade 7. I am weird as far as medicine goes and it never worked as intended, side effects for other pills were things such as no free will, not remembering anything that I did for 3 years, no control of self awareness or recollection of my actions, fainting or passing out without warning. I went off the pills in grade 7 due to mental and physical health issues and concerns. Decided to take the pills again because I need them to graduate, started on Vyvasne. It is 1000X times better than any other pill that I have tried over the years. Biggest problems is lack of appetite (went 26 hours without eating without realizing it) started on 80MG by mistake.""",1
Strattera,ADHD,"""In the 6th grade I missed two consecutive days, then took my pill as I would any other day. Throughout the day I felt terrible and eventually I went to the nurse. She took my heart rate and said it would&#039;ve been okay if I had just sprinted a mile, but I had been sitting in class. She checked again 10 minutes later and my heart rate was slower than it should have been at a resting state. She called my parents and I went to the doctor immediately. I had to be hooked up to machines and monitored. The nurse said I was lucky not to have a heart attack that day. I&#039;ve been scared of Stratera/Adderall/Ritalin ever since.""",1
Pristiq,Depression,"""I have been taking 50mg of Pristiq for about 5 weeks now, and just started taking 100 mg a couple days ago. I am 31 yrs old, but have been on antidepressants for 10 yrs. I&#039;ve tried many SSRI&#039;s (Lexapro for several yrs) and never felt much better at all. I remained depressed and began to try to accept that this is just what my life would be. Finally, about 2 months ago my Drs office began doing genetic testing which can guide them on what medicines your body will respond best to. So Pristiq it was. I think my mood has lifted somewhat. I&#039;m really hoping it will improve even more as studies show full benefits take 6-8 weeks. """,5
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I have been on various medications for years, some have been Lortab, non-narcotic pain medications, Ms-contin, Oxycontin and fentanyl patches.  I was on 150 micrograms of fentanyl/48 hours before switching to Opana ER.  Initially I was taking 20mg of Opana 2x/day and it was not sufficient for my pain, but I couldn&#039;t handle the side-effects of the fentanyl patches (narcolepsy) so I worked with my doctor to increase my dosage and frequency so that I now take 30mg 2x/day and 20mg 1x/day.  It is expensive but I am finally able to live a near-normal life.  I play with my kids, I don&#039;t miss work, and I even keep the house up (with great help from my better half).  Opana ER has been great for pain relief with almost no side-effects!""",9
Nortriptyline,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had a lot of pains over the past few years due to computer-centric lifestyle. My rear shoulder/shoulder blade pain started to become unmanageable with my Lyrica+Tramadol. Most of my pains are a nervy/burning. I decided to try Nortriptyline. Started with 10mg and worked up to 100mg after months (started working at 25mg).  Saved my life at that time when I was miserable.  It wasn&#039;t 100%, and had a bunch of mild side effects, but made things manageable. Side effects: weight gain (huge appetite), urinary retention, dry nose/mouth, some drowsiness (bad at first, but got better), reduced motor control (jerks), orthostatic hypotension. Trying to stop to see if pain comes back, and so far so good (side effects have reduced -- esp. appetite).""",9
Ambien,Insomnia,"""Helps me sleep through the night for the first time in my life. The first time I ever took it I made the mistake of not going to bed right away so I did have some hallucinations. They weren&#039;t scary, but I make sure to take it only when I go to bed. There are some definite sexual side effects, much to my husband&#039;s good fortune. It all seems like a vague dream when I wake up. It&#039;s probably a good idea to only take it when you&#039;re living with someone you trust!""",0
Skyla,Birth Control,"""23 y/o, never pregnant; got Skyla put in Aug 22. Before Skyla, tried the pill-wasn&#039;t for me. Went in on the 1st day of period, wasn&#039;t too bad, did hurt for a quick sec when they put it in. Post-insertion cramps were probably the worst part. No Advil beforehand (mistake) so those hurt, nothing too crucial (I&#039;d say I have high pain tolerance tho) Only had about 4 big cramps that day. Up til 4 days ago, I was spotting so had to wear a pad liner/light tampon. I&#039;d cramp worse than usual around ovulation. 1st period was normal. Was pretty moody at the 2nd week, cried really easily. I&#039;ve gained a few lbs but diet &amp; lifestyle also come into play there. Sex drive &amp; acne haven&#039;t been affected. I Recommend!! Every1 is different! Will Update L8R again""",8
Silenor,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Silenor every night for 5 months and love it.  It doesn&#039;t knock me out or make me loopy like Ambien.  Silenor just makes me a bit drowsy, but more importantly is that when I wake up in the middle of the night I fall right back to sleep - which is a lifesaver for me. Since it&#039;s non-addictive, this is great for just normal calm times in my life, which is 95% of the time.  But when I&#039;m stressing out over something and all panicky, then Silenor does practically nothing for me.  I have to take Ambien or Ativan during that 1-2 week period I&#039;m stressing.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I absolutely LOVE this medicine. I lost 30 pounds on it last year and have lost 7 lbs on it in the last month (no exercise). It makes me feel good and gives me the energy to get things done. My libido had been down due to being on anti-depressants BUT this medicine has affected my libido in a GOOD way. It also helps tremendously because I have ADHD. It helps so much with that too. I love this medicine.

HOWEVER don&#039;t drink a lot when you take it. When I first started it last April I drank WAY too much and ended up in the hospital. The doctor was amazed that they hadn&#039;t told me not to drink on it but all is well now.""",3
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Started Saxenda on Feb 1, 2016.  Minimal side effects, no issues with constipation.  Only able to tolerate small portions and must eat every 3-4 hours during the day, if I don&#039;t eat I get nauseous. Worst time for me use to be around dinner time when I could not stop snacking, now those cravings are gone YAH!  10 lbs lost in 4 weeks, just what I wanted slow and steady.  Insurance does cover, so will be continuing until goal weight of 150.""",2
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""So far the best medication for bipolar disorder I&#039;ve taken.  I started out successfully at 20mg for a year.  Then I developed twitching on the left side of my body.  My doctor reduced my dosage to 2 mg a day and put me on Artane.   I am glad I found this medicine because I don&#039;t have to take it daily and I no longer feel as if I&#039;m going insane.  Helpful, but you really need to pay attention to the way your body handles it. My twitching has gone away thankfully.""",6
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""I have been treated with Lexapro, Zoloft, Pristiq, Klonopin and lamictal and none were effective. I have been taking Cymbalta for about one week now, and still don&#039;t feel any different. I wake up every day feeling 100% anxious and find it extremely hard to get out of bed. It has been this severe for about two months now where I feel totally incapable of living. Doctor said to stay on Cymbalta and see if it changes anything. Feeling hopeful!""",7
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed zolpidem to treat my sleep issues.  I took it for about two months.  It did allow me to sleep through the night, however I noticed significant mood changes.  I became very aggressive and emotional at the drop of a hat.  I became concerned because I could not fall asleep without taking zolpidem.  I became shaky at times and just didn&#039;t feel right.  I found a new doctor and have been off the zolpidem for a week now.  She gave me trazodone which is not so addictive.  I have slept the last two nights with no medicines at all.  I am feeling so much better.  I know everyone reacts differently to medicine but I feel that the zolpidem made things worse for me.  I am relieved to be off of zolpidem.""",0
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on the ring for about 2 years and I LOVE the ease of it but don&#039;t like the decrease in sex drive (its non existent) and the increase in breast size. I have implants....don&#039;t need them larger! I&#039;ve been crazy, moody also which I didn&#039;t really attribute to this until after reading the reviews.  I&#039;m switching back to pills to see if it really was the ring or not.""",8
Minocycline,Acne,"""I had acne for 7 years. By senior year of high school, I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. I went to a dermatologist and he prescribed minocycline to me. I was afraid of the initial breakout, but it wasn&#039;t bad whatsoever! My acne cleared up sooooooo much. My skin was clear by the second week! It got rid of ALL of my blackheads. I took it for about 5  months. It&#039;s been 6 months since I stopped, and I still get small breakouts, but it&#039;s nothing like the acne I had before it. I love minocycline. While I was on it I looked prettier, my hair looked healthier, my skin wasn&#039;t oily, just everything about me felt and looked better. It gave me a yeast infection, but I ate yogurt...a LOT of yogurt, and that got rid of it right away.""",4
Pemoline,ADHD,"""I started on Cylert in 1990 and my brain activity took off.  I was concentrating better, I wasn&#039;t as nervous as I used to be. I stopped taking it because my doctor moved from one location to out of state.  I figured I&#039;d give it a try without it.  I went back on it in 1998 for a period of time and felt as I did back in the early 1990s.  I now cannot get it because of hepatic problems, but I am willing to keep taking it because it is and was the best ADD medication I have ever had.  I am very upset and sorry for all of us who do not use it anymore and there are no more alternatives closest to Cylert.  Maybe one day there will be, but until then, with all of the medications I have tried, my mind will continue to spin and constantly be on run.""",1
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks.  I am on day seven and haven&#039;t noticed any improvements, my anxiety  was increased and I am experiencing some dizziness.  However I am going to let the pill take it&#039;s course even though it&#039;s been hard to continue on it.   My dad took the pill and had success with it so I&#039;m hoping that&#039;s the case for me!  Most of all just think positive that it will work! You will get through this! :)""",7
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""While the irregular periods, frequent spotting, and slightly heavier periods are a drag, the shot has worked very well for me. It is very effective at preventing pregnancy, and is low-maintenance. All you need to worry about is getting the shot every 3 months.
My periods weren&#039;t bad before the shot, and they&#039;ve stayed exactly the same, besides being unpredictable. Just have to worry about changing my pad/tampon. No bad cramps, same amount of acne as usual, and no side effects to speak of.
I&#039;m only on my 6th month of the shot now, and I&#039;ve heard that after 6 months, the periods typically become more predictable at least, and less blood is shed from spotting. Quite a few women stop having their periods actually, which is what I&#039;m hoping for.""",8
Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,"""Im writing this because reading this same page is what ultimately convinced me to give birth control a try for my stubborn, cystic, HORMONAL acne. If you&#039;ve tried everything in the book for acne like I have, (antibiotics, prescribed antibiotics, every OTC cream and wash on the market, DIY...) and it&#039;s been as a relentlessly tiring experience- please try BCPs. After talking w my dr, she said that after a week I should see a difference bc thats when your body adjusts. After a week seeing not only no difference but seemingly worse cystic acne all around my chin (my number #1 problem area) I ended up back on here and countless other websites to refer to other people&#039;s experiences. And thank god I did- GIVE IT TIME!!!! That&#039;s the key to this.""",4
Cymbalta,Depression,"""I have been on cymbalta for over year, the relief it gave me was a god send. I hated the sweaty side effect, so I stopped taking it for a couple of months, withdrawl was horrible, depression was horrible again. I&#039;ve been back on it for about two months now and I take 120mg a day along with 300mg welbutrin, I wish I could take more. I wish they would put it in the drinking water so everyone could benefit from the effects.""",5
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have been on Vyvanse 30 mg for a year now and have had success taking it. I can work full time, have time management, take great care of my kids and keep my house clean. I sleep just fine at night. I do get irritable throughout the day if I don&#039;t eat. I feel nauseous and sick if I don&#039;t snack and stay hydrated. Hate to say it but it also worsens my anxiety slightly in the morning. Pros have outweighed the cons. As for weight loss I lost 7 pounds when I started taking it but have stayed at 130 pounds same weight for a year I am 5&#039;5 and 28 years old. I feel healthy.""",1
Zoloft,Depression,"""I have been on Zoloft several times. The only side effect was the &quot;runs&quot; which is fine you can take anti-diarrhea medication.  I am also on Epilim, I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar which in itself is a good thing.  No antidepressant worked for me, I was always low.  And off them I was both hyper and low.  It was horrible, then the anxiety kicked in.  So that&#039;s why I am glad to be finally diagnosed as at least I can get help and proper treatment.  Zoloft is brilliant for anxiety, but it didn&#039;t stop the bad lows and I was so tired. But no side effects whatsoever, well only the runs - which you learn to live with.""",5
Fluvoxamine,Depression,"""I stated on Fluvoxamine 5 years ago. Then when fluvoxamine 100 mg extended release came out I switched to it.
I&#039;ve been experiencing sporadic low grade fevers, intestinal cramping, diarrhea and red eyes.
I&#039;ve been through years of testing and finally came up with an answer Fluvoxamine.  This medication interacts with many other medications and can cause serious and fatal side effects.  This medication is extremely hard to wean off of. 
It helped my depression initially but now has caused me more depression.""",5
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Hi everyone! I started taking Saxenda 10 days and have already lost about 8 pounds. The first night I was very nauseous, but it hasn&#039;t been as bad. My appetite has become virtually non existent. I eat maybe a forth of what I used to eat, but I&#039;m loving the results already. I&#039;ve been on Metformin for almost 10 years and it&#039;s never done what this medication has. I&#039;m on my way to my goal weight!""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Have had Nexplanon for a year.
Pros: No pregnancy, no daily pill, no headaches, no mood swings, no loss of sex drive, long stretches w/no period.
Cons: Terrible insertion experience, lengthy periods, weight GAIN!!!
Insertion - First off, getting this thing inserted was a nightmare. I had to go back about 4 times due to pain, infection and immobility in my arm. Now I have scars/keloids so bad I am considering a tattoo to cover them.
Cycle - Long stretches w/no period, but when I do get it, it lasts for 2 weeks-1 month!
Weight - Had Norplant for years and NO side effects. I heard of others having weight gain but I never did. With Nexplanon, I have gained 30 pounds and NOTHING I DO takes the weight off. Strongly considering getting it removed.""",8
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have a ruptured disc at c6/c7 and the pain became excruciating and really took over my life. I&#039;m a single mother of two small children and work a demanding job. I didn&#039;t know how I would make it through the pain got to be so bad. Tramadol didn&#039;t even take the edge off of the pain anymore. Saw my pain doctor on Monday and he prescribed Nucynta and Zanaflex. Let me preface it by saying that I pretty much couldn&#039;t move on Monday my mobility was so bad. I took both pills immediately upon picking the prescriptions up. Within a half hour I could feel my super tight muscles starting to loosen up a bit. By the 2nd dose of Nucynta the pain went from a 10 to a 3. I have super dry mouth as a side effect but I&#039;ll take that over the pain.""",9
Amphetamine,ADHD,"""My son has tried everything for ADHD. Vyvanse wears off too quickly and Adderall XR made him moody. We tried the dissolvable tablet but he hated the gritty orange flavor. As a last resort to going back to Vyvanse, the pediatrician put him on the new long acting Dyanavel XR. It lasts all day which is great for all the middle school homework he has in the evenings. My favorite thing about Dyanavel is that he still has his appetite and is sleeping well. The copay card made it cheaper than a generic too!""",1
Ambien CR,Insomnia,"""Ambien CR assists me in falling asleep but only briefly, often waking after just 3-4 hours. When it does work, I don&#039;t recall things like getting up to turn on lights and the TV full blast! I have also experienced dizziness, loss of motor skills and next day grogginess/sleepiness. Today I woke to find my small craft table smashed on the floor all the craft items scattered on the floor. A crash like that would most certainly have awoken me right? Well no it didn&#039;t and I don&#039;t recall knocking it over! So it had to be me while sleepwalking again! I have turned to taking it only when I am truly desperate for a decent night&#039;s sleep!  """,0
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I have never written a review about a product until now! I&#039;m a 34 year old female &amp; started getting chin acne in my late twenties- nothing helped, I tried everything from Proactiv to Tretonion to antibiotics! About 4 months ago my dermatologist put me on Atralin &amp; oh my what a difference in 4 months! I even go without makeup now! I never get a pimple now it&#039;s wonderful &amp; it makes my skin look Dewey &amp; hydrated not dried out &amp; flakey as with the Tretonion I tried. Highly recommend Atralin!""",4
Fetzima,Depression,"""I have been taking Effexor, 300 mg for 15 years and Lexapro, 40 mg for about eight.  I have tried to stop taking Effexor twice with horrible experiences each time.  My depression began to increase so the Dr. prescribed stopping Lexapro immediately and gradually decreasing Effexor and replacing it with Fetzima (first 40, now 80mg).  I was hesitant due to my prior experiences but the Dr. seemed confident.  After 12 weeks, today is my first day without any Effexor, only 80 mg of Fetzima.  I feel great; I had no negative side effects from the changes and notice definite improvement in my depression.  I believe the depression will continue to lift with time.  I am so relieved to finally be free of Effexor I believe Fetzima made it possible.""",5
Adderall,ADHD,"""When I was diagnosed with ADHD in the 3rd grade they put me on Adderall and then I became a person I was not. I had social anxiety but got exceptionally good grades in school where others failed. Adderall changes your personality and was the worst 12 years of my life, I had no friends because engaging in conversation was nearly impossible. It traps your thoughts in a prison of your mind and suppresses any creativity. """,1
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""This drug is a god send I suffered from bipolar since I was 17 im now 21 I have mixed episode that last for 6 month or more. I tried evey single medicine and I mean every thing antidepressant make me worse I have panic attack, fears ,alot of tears, a lot of depression, obsessive songs in my head lol and nothing seems to work like this one. I left all other drugs (not cold turkey ) , and started it and within 2 weeks I got normal - no panic, no depression and of course no hypomanic no side effect at all , this drug saved I&#039;m more stable focused try it if you are bipolar 2 its a game changer""",6
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I was on 300mg. Of Effexor XR for 3 years and did not realise what it was doing to me until I weaned myself off it.  I had constant suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide several times.  I had severe alcohol craving and was labelled an alcoholic and had several very expensive stays in re-hab.  I suffered horrific nightmares, paranoia and at times had difficulty rationalising what was reality.  I lost all ability to handle my finances.  My relationships were severely damaged because of this and I almost died 4 times.  I have now been off it for 4 months and I am a different person.  I no longer have nightmares, suicidal thoughts or crave or drink alcohol. This is an extremely dangerous drug!  Avoid it completely!  My story is not unique.""",5
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I have been using Contrave for four months and have lost more than 40 lbs.  I was nauseous for the first week and then when I increased the dosage.  It has helped me tremendously with the cravings.  I have been walking and now working up to a slow jog for about 45 minutes a day.  The medication will not help you lose weight if you do not watch what you eat or exercise.  It is expensive and insurance will not cover it, however it has been extremely worth it to me so far.  Hoping I will wing myself off and continue to eat the right things and exercise.""",3
Tylenol PM,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve taken other prescription sleep medications in the past but they do tend to make your drowsy and have all sorts of side effects.  I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and the pain stops me from sleeping.  I now take this at bedtime with a small dose prescribed codeine.  Between the painkillers and the &quot;sleep&quot; effect of the Tylenol, I truly can&#039;t believe how well I am sleeping!  Just be aware that this can really make you fall asleep fast so do be ready for bed.  I&#039;ve spoken to four other people who have various pain problems and they all love this medication too.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""During my pregnancy I put on about 50 lbs! Now I&#039;m trying to get it off. Just started phentermine up again a few days ago at 194 lbs. I work out at the gym 2-3 days a week doing cardio and weights. I also walk about 30 minutes most weekdays during my lunch break. I already feel my clothes fitting looser. I get very jittery, have dry mouth and insomnia. I will stick to it because I have had excellent results with it in the past. In 2007 I lost over 50 lbs in about 6 months. My target range is 140-150 this time. So I am wishing all of us luck. Please remember that once you get off the medication it is very easy to put the weight back on unless you really work at it.""",3
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""I was in the E.R. for pain associated with condition causing kidney stone {1 in each kidney}. I am severely allergic to all anti-emetic drugs (anti nausea/vomiting drugs) but I required a potent pain killer. I was given Dilaudid by i.v. having never been on anything stronger than Percocet pills the doctors were afraid that I&#039;d become very nauseous and vomit profusely and unable to be treated for nausea. To my relief it did the trick! I only vomited once, was prescribed hydromorphone 2mg. NO SIDE EFFECTS! I was to sick to see the beauty in everyday life, until now!""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I started taking Accutane about 1 month ago and my big stick out zits have gone flat. Although I still have a lot of red spots my face it is for the most part completely smooth. I would recommend this product to anyone who&#039;s tried everything and hasn&#039;t gotten an effective treatment. I&#039;m a 14 year old boy and I&#039;ve been dealing with acne for 5 years. Nothing helped. I tried so many different topical, oral and store bought products its crazy! I know how depressing it is to have acne in middle school and I&#039;m so thankful I found this before high school. But even with a great product comes a down side, such as chapped lips, dry eyes, dry skin, irritability, and depression. Other than that I&#039;m in love with Accutane!""",4
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I am 58, married father of 2.  I had a major crash about a month ago.  Got addicted to gambling and finally told my wife, then the crash.  I have always had some anxiety throughout my life.  Nothing like this.  Been on it for 4 days, tired and sleep is so so.  My hope is that given more time I will see more benefits.  Right now it&#039;s a struggle to see getting better and tough for my son to see his Dad suffering. Dr says 1-2 weeks to see full benefits.

""",5
Alprazolam,Depression,"""I had always heard the negative jargon of Xanax, and was afraid to take it because I was afraid I would be addicted and unable to control it. 
Eventually things were to tough and I was in one of the darkest points of my life. So I broke down and talk with my doctor about giving it a try. It totally changed my life. It helped me to focus more at work. It helped manage my anxiety so my mind could rest and I could sleep. 
I could see how this medication could be misused it&#039;s important to take as prescribed.""",5
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking this medicine about 4 years ago for bipolar. This medicine was exactly what I needed. I still felt my emotions but had control of them. I might get upset at something but didn&#039;t go full tilt &quot;hulk mad.&quot; I always explain it to the doc like this: it brings my highs down and my lows up. The only downside is I don&#039;t ever experience the emotion of &quot;happy.&quot; I have forgotten what it is like to have a good time so I mimic what I see other people doing in social settings to appear normal. An interesting side effect I noticed is that when I am depressed I don&#039;t feel depressed. I can tell by all of the normal symptoms. I just don&#039;t feel it.""",6
Paroxetine,Anxiety,"""Social anxiety involved with my job was causing insomnia and a feeling of constant dread. I take 20 mg.  Here is how it affects me:
I no longer lay awake at night worrying about the next day.  However, I now wake up several times a night on Paxil, but always quickly fall back to sleep.  So overall, this is a great improvement in sleep for me.  Oddly, my dreams are now very vivid.  I have actually woken up laughing.  Rather than fearing social interaction, now at worst I am mildly annoyed by it. I have not been transformed to a gregarious person, but social interaction it something I no longer fear facing.  Other side effects:  mild constipation, less prone to anger, 80% loss in sexual interest, and alcohol has more of an effect""",7
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I am half way through my second implant! I cannot lie. I love it. First 2 months were hell but you have to let your body get used to the fact you have a hormone replacement. You cannot expect it to be quick change over. My skin has stayed the same. Weight pretty similar a little heavy but that is due to my eating!! I will say I do have a low sex drive but unfortunately I think that&#039;s just me!! I have some read some people really slating the implant but by there own admission they have only tried it for a week or so?? You can&#039;t expect it to be a dream at the beginning you are changing your body&#039;s way of working. I recommend giving it at least 6 months. I went through the long period but now I haven&#039;t had period in 4 years!! hope this help""",8
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started using Saxenda in mid April 2916 and lost 10k effortlessly by mid July 2016. Experienced lethargy in the initial stages every time I upped the dose, but on reaching 3mg, I felt fine. I feel so much better since losing all that weight, have lost a further 3 kg over the past 3 months and feel encouraged to lose a further 8 kg. The  product is brilliant for losing the first 10% of weight, but thereafter  I know I have to make major changes to my diet and exercise to lose the rest, which I guess is the aim to start off with. I find Saxenda brilliant to give me a good head start though.""",2
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""I was put on Intuniv because I have schizophrenia and ADHD as I can&#039;t take the stimulant type medications.  I used the starter kit and did not notice any improvement in my focus or attention.  I was so tired I was falling asleep at 7-9pm at night and waking up at 6-7 in the morning.  I went to table tennis and was just a zombie.  I was asleep on my feet and couldn&#039;t wait for class to end instead of being my normal happy active self during class. I stopped taking this medicine ...even if it had helped with my ADHD it would probably have not been worth the side effects.""",1
Minocycline,Acne,"""This medicine was amazing for my acne.  It went away almost immediately.  For once I just didn&#039;t have to worry about it and it was great. I stopped wearing makeup altogether.  HOWEVER... it made me very aggressive and angry all the time.  It gave me severe anxiety, and made me very emotional.  I&#039;d fight with everyone.  I even saw a therapist for my anger.  But once I got off the drug I completely calmed down. It took over my head.  I had no control.  My boyfriend almost dumped me.  My best friend hated me.  It was not worth it.  My acne came back and I considered it again... but with all those side effects... it can also give you arthritis and lupus with extended use.  I just don&#039;t trust it.  So now i only saw it as a temporary solution.""",4
Vicodin,Pain,"""Vicodin is an excellent pain killer for oral or any kind of surgery to bring home. It doesn&#039;t make me sick to my stomach the way some other pain pills do. I have Fibromyalgia and CFS and took it for that type of pain but it was too short acting and I needed to keep increasing the dose. It also has a lot of Tylenol in it for long term use which can damage the liver so I&#039;m on something else now for my Fibromyalgia pain. It does the job very well for short term pain relief.""",9
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My son is 13 and has been on several ADHD medications.  I liked the Vyvance at first because I did see an improvement in his ability to sit and listen and pay attention, however it didn&#039;t last long enough.  The doctor has increased the dosage several time and now he is up to 60mg daily. The problem is that he has lost over 20lbs because he simply won&#039;t eat and now it seems after four months on this medicine its like his body has adapted to it and he is super hyper.  I spoke to the doctor about it and he said he can do real damage at his age with the weight loss and not eating and that the stimulant is actually wiring him up.  We are going to take him off of the Vyvanse and put him on a non stimulant medication.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I actually started Contrave on November 21, 2015 and lost a couple of pounds but gained back Christmas.  It took until Jan. 2 to work up to the full dose; then I really started to lose. Since Jan. 2 (today is Jan. 30)  I have lost a total of 18 pounds with Contrave, the Scale-Down program (weighing daily), low carb diet and 23 minutes on the  elliptical almost every day.   About mid-Jan I hit a plateau and hovered around the same weight for two weeks.   I start losing again by cutting back food portions and cutting some fat out of the Atkins approach.  I also doubled my elliptical workout to 46 minutes a day at least 5 days a week.  That got the weight loss going again.  I haven&#039;t had this kind of success since the old diet pill days.""",2
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""I am 23 and have had Paragard in for 6 months. I got it because I was going to be working abroad without access to daily BC options. The insertion was almost painless, just a pinch feeling. About an hour after I began to feel cramps and some pain. The next day it was mild and then gone by night time. My first period was way heavier than I was used to! I also had terrible cramps and pains. I wanted to get Paragard removed but I couldn&#039;t since I was abroad. The next few periods were also painfully crampy with heavy bleeding but I noticed the pain decreased with each period. Now I have had seven periods and it is back to normal with just very minor cramps. The bleeding is not as heavy either. I am happy I never had it removed!""",8
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I would be in bed all day without this medicine. I have tried A LOT of pain pills and never really got much relief. I have A.L.S. and this medicine has made me be able to get up and do things, which I wasn&#039;t able to do before I was on this medicine. I could not even get out of bed without such bad pain. At least now I can enjoy what time I have with my family without being in such severe pain and still I have pain even with Oxycontin I never get pain free but it is tolerable with this drug. It was not even tolerable with others I have tried in the past.""",9
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""I&#039;m glad to hear that I&#039;m not the only one who is having a horrible break out because of this pill.  I&#039;ve been taking it for 1.5 months, and my face, chest and back started to break out.  In addition, it is very expensive.  The one positive thing I did experience, is no bad headaches during my period like I used to get with other pills. Will go back to another pill that doesn&#039;t cause me these bad breakouts.""",4
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I just started using Ambien CR and like most of the people i was scared to take it because of all of these weird side effects that people experience but thank GOD it worked on me just fine. My doctor was gentle to me and she prescribed only 5mg and I must say it worked like a charm. I took it and half hour later (maybe even less) I was deep in sleep. I did sleep close to 5 hours and I must say I don&#039;t remember the last time I was feeling so refreshed and so rested. Other medicines I&#039;ve tried put me asleep but when I would wake up I would feel so groggy. I&#039;m finally happy to say that I found a medicine that works for me.""",0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had my mirena since Tuesday (4 days).  I have never had kids.  I was not on my cycle.  I have horrible periods so my doctor recommended this. In my mind I was thinking this is going to be horrible as I had other exams that had me in horrendous pain.  Insertion took about 2 minutes. Only pain I felt was when he was measuring the uterus.  Felt like cramps.  I  did not even feel it going in.  The Dr said ok that&#039;s it. I had no idea it was over.  Afterwards I went to lunch.  Little cramps after I got home,  through the night and the next day.  Just took tylenol.  Only spotted the day that I got it.  So far so good.""",8
Accutane,Acne,"""Horrible side effects (virtually all the ones listed) and did not cure my acne.  In fact, it made my acne about 10 times worse than before.  I find it strange that an &quot;initial breakout&quot; could last well over a month and be continuing to get worse, leaving scars that I never would have otherwise had.  This drug was a total disaster for me and I stopped after a couple months.  My face is still not back to how it was (which would be comparatively awesome and I had moderate-severe acne before), and to be perfectly honest this was the worst decision I could have made for my health and emotional wellbeing.""",4
Ketorolac,Pain,"""I have the equivalent of Sciatica, in my arm. Cannot move it without severe pain, (typing now with one hand!)  I have had Sciatica in my leg also, but was able to do stretches to relieve the pain. Cannot find stretches for my arm that work...so on to the Doctor.  She gave me a shot of Toradol 15mg/4units...knocked it right out! but a day and half later it came back.  I&#039;m taking steroids now, on the 2nd day of the med pack, and still miserable....

PS,....go online and search coupons, you will get the first 15 days free and then you will get the next 6 months like $65.00 off or something I will let you know tomorrow when I get it filled.

I started out 269 pounds. I am now 191 pounds . I am on the 11.25-69 MG about to get switched to the last MG. 
I have had no side effects. 
All I&#039;ve done is stop drinking cokes all together, and I&#039;ve limited how much I eat thanks to Qsymia. I feel fuller faster. 
I walk more and have more energy since I&#039;ve lost my weight. 
I&#039;ve got more to lose. I am not giving up.""",2
Topiramate,Bipolar Disorde,"""Works wonders on rapid cycling.  I really love this medicine.  I know it is off label for bipolar, but wow!  I take it with another mood stabilizer, antipsychotic and a when required antipsychotic and antidepressant, and it has stabilized my Ultradian cycling that is so hard to treat.  I feel normal again.  I take 150mg.  Also can work in conjunction with other common weigh gainer medicines to cancel out the weigh gain effect - just a tip.""",6
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""It&#039;s tough to give an accurate rating for this drug because my 1st experience is really all I have to go on. I was prescribed this as a doctor recommendation over Ambien (which I love &amp; will return to). 
My reaction to this drug was bad. I am prone to Panic in reaction to body sensations &amp; trazodone was loaded with them. About 25 min after taking 50mg I began to feel dizzy, off balance, &amp; had a drugged feeling. I became very edgy &amp; worried, got a strange taste in my upper gums, my nasal passages closed up, &amp; I experienced a spinning sensation. I personally did not react well &amp; went to bed with a racing heart. Ironically I fell asleep &amp; slept pretty well. Woke up once &amp; the room was spinning. Felt very hung over the next day. Not pleasant""",0
Duac,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this for almost 2 months now and it helped clear my face. It also regulates the skin&#039;s sebum production hence reducing oiliness. Side effects are peeling, redness, increased sun sensitivity, burning and itching. I recommend to first time users to put a very small amount to parts affected. Patience is the key. For a week or two your face will really adjust to it but it works. My face even has a pinkish glow to it now and I feel more confident.""",4
Morphine,Pain,"""I am retired, but still read and do many other activities. I was taking MsContin 30mg 3x and Oxycodone IR 10mg 4x per day. I stopped reading and crocheting. I stopped watching my favorite programs. I never knew when I was going to fall asleep. I became hostile, angry, depressed, paranoid and had substantial memory loss. I stopped talking to people and was tired all the time. I didn&#039;t connect it to my pain medication because I have numerous chronic illnesses. Last year my doctor suggested a change to Oxycontin, but I was afraid. A month ago I started taking Oxycodone IR 10mg four times a day and Xtampza 18mg three times per day. I wish I had done it sooner. I have eat a good meal with the Xtampza but,I am awake and my real personality is back. My energy is up.""",9
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I was put on klonopin at age 17. I took it as prescribed for 20 years, going from 0. 5mgs to 3-4mgs a day. While it worked great for anxiety and insomnia, I wish I had never taken this medication. Last year I was detoxed off of it. When I tapered off I didn&#039;t sleep at all for 11 days. After that I had extreme anxiety and agitation. I couldn&#039;t sit still for months, I had to take a non addictive medication to be able to sleep at all. I was unable to eat well for months. 
Doctors don&#039;t think to tell you that this medication makes you physically dependant. You cannot stop abruptly or you risk seizures. It is made for short term use, about 2 weeks. I wish I had never taken this medication. I will never take another benzodiazapine again.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been on this for 4 months and have lost 18 lbs.  I think I have stalled because I am not sleeping due to taking it too late.  I also only had about 40 lbs to lose so I&#039;m thinking it may be slower compared to people who want to lose more.  My biggest concern is absolutely no one can tell that I have lost anything at all!! This makes me think that I&#039;ve lost all muscle and no fat.  How could 18 lbs not show?  I haven&#039;t worked out but am going to start to this upcoming week.  Has anyone else had this problem?""",3
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda in November 2016, the week before Thanksgiving. It is January 31, 2017. I am 5&#039; 1&quot; and when I started Saxenda I weighed 205 lbs. I now weigh 178 lbs. I have been able to come off of my blood pressure meds and I no longer need my CPAP when I sleep at night. I have less joint pain and I no longer get winded walking up a flight of stairs.The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced are nausea with each titration up of the medication, mild headache the first few weeks, nasty sulphur burps, and diarrhea. I haven&#039;t had any constipation. None of the side effects were severe enough to make me consider stopping the medication.""",2
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I cannot stress enough how thankful I am for this medication. I had always been a very smart kid but my drive and focus would come in very short bursts if I was interested otherwise I could not have cared less. I was prescribed 30mg of Vyvanse initially and that was upped to 50mg which I have been taking for over a year now. My grades went from a 3.2 GPA to a 4.0 within a semester. I excelled at work. I am a more alert driver. Like everyone else has said, I feel as if my thoughts are all organized the way they always should have been and I am finally able to catch up on life, which always seemed out of reach. I strongly prefer this medication over Adderall IR which I tried. There are no negative side effects except insomnia.""",1
Tranylcypromine,Depression,"""After only a few days on Parnate, my mood declined, my sex drive totally disappeared, I lost my appetite completely, and I could only sleep 4-5 hours a night. Then my blood pressure dropped and I wasn&#039;t able to stand much. I had heart palpitations after taking it. My mood was so dark, and my body so weak, that all I did I was lie in bed for 10 days. I already have problems getting out of bed but this made it feel impossible to move. It was absolutely miserable. I had to stop taking Parnate because it made me SO MUCH worse and I couldn&#039;t work, eat, sleep, laugh, nothing. The reviews on here are not a balanced representation of this drug. (I have bipolar 2 depression, social anxiety, GAD, ADHD)""",5
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I was 21 when I got Implanon inserted. I wanted an easy to remember contraceptive that was not placed in my uterus, that kind of freaks me out. Simple straight forward insertion, few days of bruising. I had it inserted after my baby turned 8 weeks. I hadn&#039;t had my period yet, and after the insertion, continued to not have periods for a whole year (up to today) no mood swings, no acne, a really great birth control! However I have a non existent sex drive and it&#039;s really rocking my marriage. After a lot of contemplation and concluding that it&#039;s the birth control and not likely the breastfeeding causing this lack of libido (possibly mom-hood too), I am removing it next week and going back on pills. Good luck to my sex life!""",8
Sertraline,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Sertraline for 5 months now I started out at 50mg and it seemed to be ok my anxiety attacks were becoming far less and I was a lot happier then about 3 months later I found I was having panic attacks again and now for the last month I&#039;ve been on 100mg my mood is so bad it&#039;s affecting my relationship and I always just feel down and worthless I&#039;m going back to the doctor soon to hopefully sort it out""",5
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""This medication was possibly the worst experience of my life. In the matter of a week, i managed to have my boss lose all hope in me, i ruined my 3 year relationship and for the first time in my life, i was so depressed i had thoughts of death ( not to mention I was kind of moody all day). Not to mention it actually made my memory and focus worse! Thank God i had a couple adderall left to make it until my next (emergency) appointment!

Thanks Vyvanse! You really changed my life!

I have a psyc appointment tomorrow morning, i am going back to adderall! Vyvanse didnt last a full week for me, maybe it&#039;s different for other people.

""",1
Bupropion,Depression,"""My depression is more work related as I&#039;m a happy camper when I don&#039;t have to work, but I get nasty and temperamental at work.  Also I wanted to quit smoking.  I take the generic brand since I&#039;m VA so I have no choice but it works fine!  I am much easier to get along with at work, I have quit smoking (YAY!!) and I have zero side effects.  Some may say I&#039;m sleeping more than usual, but I&#039;m OK with that.""",5
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I was on it for years but with remeron it helped for a while but my body I guess got used to it so it stopped working.  I could never take it alone or I would never fall asleep.  Lately I just want to be able to take naps before I take my new sleep meds and still have a script for it so I tried taking it on its own again and it&#039;s a complete waste I don&#039;t even get tired.  I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s my tolerance or what but it&#039;s horrible and my sleep is horrible I&#039;ve tried everything. Ugh someday something will work!!""",0
Bactrim DS,Acne,"""Having acne for most of your teenage years into your early 20s is not fun. Being a 21 year old who went through Doxycycline and Minocycline, I thought I exhausted all of my options. I saw a few dermatologists who pushed Accutane down my throat. I said no. I went to my family doctor and I&#039;ve been on Bactrim DS for over 6 months now and it is the best thing that has cleared up my acne. So powerful. I would highly recommend this medication.""",4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""This medication works YES...HOWEVER it has side effects not listed &amp; if you don&#039;t workout then you&#039;re not going to see the same results as the people loosing the mass amounts of weight!!! I took this supplement/medication almost 6 years ago &amp; I worked my hind end off the 30 days I took it I lost 17 pounds that&#039;s all I need motivation to get me started in the right direction to a healthy life I worked out five days a wk changed all my eating habits (stopped eating when I was satisfied not full, if I craved it I bought it took a bite/drink and satisfied my craving) I was the smallest and healthiest I had ever been or so I thought till 2/25/15 when I had my gallbladder removed bc the damage me &amp; my dr believes to have been from the adipex!""",3
Strattera,ADHD,"""My experience with this drug is a bitter sweet one. However, the bitter side to it overpowers the sweet by LONG SHOT. Since I was a kid, I&#039;ve had behavioral issues and it wasn&#039;t until I was in my mid teens that they began to truly effect my way of life and my relationships with those around me. I had been taking Bupropion in combination with Sertraline and had no serious problem or complaints. However, when I started to wean off of the Sertral and began taking the Strattera, I began to get irritated and just downright pissed off for no apparent reason. The slightest things set me off, and it&#039;s only gotten worse with increased dosage. I&#039;m gonna stop taking it all together. Screw a bunch of this unprovoked anger stuff. It helps no one.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Had to have my thyroid removed because of cancer, after my surgery my weight went way up from 130 pounds to 205! Surgeon finally stabilized my thyroid medicine and I went down to my normal weight. (2011-2012) now I&#039;m back up to 186 pounds! I have tried exercising and dieting with nothing but a big FAIL! Wasn&#039;t even able to lose one pound! Finally my specialist gave me phentermine 37.5! I have only taken it so far for five days (today is day 6) and I have lost about 11 pounds 177.6 is my weight. I feel excellent on this medication and would recommend it to anyone struggling to lose weight! I am definitely going to try to start exercising again this week! Will keep everyone posted. Side effects dry mouth &amp; mood but can handle it.""",3
Clindamycin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve started &amp; still am, taking this medicine 12 weeks ago, along with minocycline. The fourth week I was using it I thought it got worse, but I kept with the product and over time I saw a major improvement from the first day I took it. It burned and dried out my face the first week, but after that my face was fine. Most of my acne is either gone, light red, or scars, so I&#039;m going back to the dermatologist next week to see what they can do about it. I definitely recommend this product!""",4
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 47 years old never did good in school but managed. My wife has been saying I am ADD and spoke to my doctor about it so after a few months of office visits, I go monthly he said he&#039;s been watching my responses and wrote me Vyvanse 30mgs. All I can say is WOW finally everything makes sense I get things done no late afternoon crash its fantastic !! I have social anxiety very bad and this miracle drug took it all away !! I&#039;m on my second month and higher dose just to 40mgs and its perfect !! I actually hugged my doctor on the following visit and thanked him for finally turning my light switch on ! I can&#039;t say enough about this miracle drug Vyvanse !! Now I can look forward to a new day instead of dreading having to get out of bed !""",1
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&#039;m a 27 year old female and I&#039;ve benn taking Saxenda for two months now. At the beginning the weight loss was rapid, but there were severe side effects. Mainly nausea and constipation, but also dry mouth and tiredness. Now it&#039;s all gone though. You should know- it&#039;s not a wonder drug. True- I&#039;ve lost 24 lbs (11kg) in 2 months, but I really pay attention to what I eat and go to the gym 3 times a week. You still need to do the work. What Saxenda does: now your work will finally have results. Which makes it much easier to keep going. By the way I&#039;m only using the 1.8 because my doctor told me to try to avoid using 3 dosage until I really need it. When you reach the &quot;plateau phase&quot; and stop losing weight that&#039;s the time to increase the dosage""",2
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""My first day on Belviq. 43 yo male - 243lbs. I had a freaky illness about 4 years ago that shook me to my core. Suffered from severe anxiety after the whole ordeal. My doc put my on Zoloft to combat the anxiety (did the trick) but I gained 25 pounds in the process. Finally stopped Zoloft but haven&#039;t been able to shed the weight despite running 3 marathons &amp; eating well. Recently approached my doc about Belviq (after great reviews on this site). After some blood tests, she prescribed it. I am sensitive to meds so I was quite nervous popping the first pill. Pretty quickly I felt a happy, a little revved-up and no much of an appetite. Stayed that way all day. No headache or dizziness so far. Fingers-crossed this is going to work.""",3
Naproxen,Pain,"""I have severe back problems. I also have arthritis.  The doctors kept giving me narcotics so I felt like a zombie all the time. and hated it.  I decided to try some Aleve.  It eased the pain enough that I can actually go out and do things I did before the back problems. No worries about being too drowsy to drive.  Not everyone can take this and you should ask your doctor before taking it.  I was an emergency room nurse for 20 years and I never had a patient with an allergic reaction to this type of medication but it can happen.  The most common side effect is stomach problems so don&#039;t take it on an empty stomach.""",9
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""In 2008, I took phendimetrazine and along with diet and moderate exercise I lost 40 lbs in 3.5 months. The only side effect I had was occasional constipation when I didn&#039;t drink enough water. I didn&#039;t feel &quot;the energy boost&quot; like I was told I would. I loved it then! After gaining back 15lb (gained weight with pregnancy) and realizing my baby is now close to 3, it&#039;s time to get back into gear. Tried diet and exercise by itself with minimal results so I resorted to finding a weight loss clinic. I&#039;ve been on the extended release for 5 days and it seems to be different. It doesn&#039;t seem to suppress my hunger like the first time around. I am still taking it though, I will weigh in on Oct. 16 so hopefully I will see results!""",2
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Unless you are extremely obese (&gt;350 pounds) and have no other options avoid this medication at all costs. Side effects for me were severe nausea, vomiting constantly, heart palpitations (which have not gone away even after stopping the medicine), chills, terrible body aches, delusions, fatigue, insomnia, bizarre dreams, and apathy. Even after stopping the medicine I can still feel after effects. This drug needs to be investigated for safety cause someone I know also had close to the same side effects as me. I did lose 2 pounds the first week but I believe it was cause I had no desire to eat and the constant vomiting. It&#039;s also very expensive.""",3
Seasonale,Birth Control,"""I have been taking seasonale for two months now.  I noticed I have been extremely tired and have a low sex drive.  I gained weight while on it which is not like me because I am very careful with my body.  I feel very blah and low now that I am on it.  I had breakthrough bleeding right away and have spotting every time I shower or go to the bathroom.  I do not like how this pill has made me feel.  I am going off of it today.""",8
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""I have been on Loestrin 24 Fe for only a month. I didn&#039;t have painful periods until I got off of birth control. I was on Depo (the shot every 3 months) and I did not have a period, but I did gain almost 15-20 pounds. I was on Depo for 3 years and then I decided to get off and I wanted to have a normal period. That&#039;s when everything went down hill. I would be in so much pain that I would call out of work, miss classes, and the pain caused me to be depressed. After ultrasounds, x-rays, no sex (too painful), they found nothing wrong. The doctors gave me Yaz, and that made me feel worse. It did control my mood swings but not the pain. Loestrin 24 Fe has been great, so far.""",4
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on 1800 mg of lithium, 400 mg of lamictal for 10 years now.  I was diagnosed bipolar 1 with anxiety more than 20 years ago.  Recently, I felt I was starting to go all over the place and I knew it was time to talk with my shrink.  He put me on  120 mg at night with .5 xanax while continuing my other 2 meds.  The first night I literally went dizzy numb my speech was severely slurred and I drooled as I tried watching TV with my children.  Next morning I was unable to drive them to school since I was still unable to clear my vision.  Night 2 I would take and called doc., he said that I needed to give it at least a 30 day cycle but leave out xanax.  I decided to self medicate and changed my dose to 60 mg daily, I bit manic but nice.""",6
Sertraline,Depression,"""My main problem with this medicine was it made me have ZERO interest in sex, and a ZERO ability to have an orgasm.  So instead of taking this medicine, I recently went to see my doc and informed her that I wanted to get off it.  She really tried to convenience me to stay on them, but I insisted that with my new eating habits, exercise program (and lack of holidays), I was doing much better, mentally.  She insisted that it was due to taking the medicines that I felt better; but to be honest, I&#039;ve always had a positive attitude about life and the atrophies that occur.  But during the holidays when she prescribed the Zoloft to me, I was depressed. """,5
Differin,Acne,"""I have mild acne and I was starting to get really frustrated with it, so I saw my doctor. He put me on Differin and told me to use it on only the spots themselves and not on my whole face. I did this before bed. When I woke up the next day I was amazed to see that all my spots were flat and much less red than they had been the previous night. I would definitely recommend Differin for people who have mild acne as well.""",4
Gabapentin,Bipolar Disorde,"""Gabapentin has been amazing for me! I have been battling bi polar my whole life. I am 50 now and have been on several antidepressants for the last 5 years. Nothing really helped. 

For the last couple years, I would wake up crying for no reason and not wanting to get out of bed.  

The last time I went to see my doc she asked me if bi polar ran in my family. I told her I wasn&#039;t sure but though there might be. 

She put me on 300 mg. The first morning I woke up after taking the med, it had an overnight result! I did NOT cry and was able to get out of bed easier. I was amazed that my life changed so much in one day! 

I highly recommend anyone suffering from bi polar to try this med.""",6
Differin,Acne,"""When I say nothing, I mean absolutely nothing helped my face to prevent breakouts and the scarring left behind until now. My mom bought this for me and with thin three days, yes three days, my face looked so good! It was only $15 too, Iv&#039;e been to two dermatologists and whatever they prescribed me made my skin worst. Anything over the counter also made my skin worst over the years. Definitely worth a try and also no burning or irritation for me!""",4
Topiramate,Bipolar Disorde,"""I had extreme vision changes, loss of memory, extreme depression with long crying spells, anger, and suicidal thoughts. I have tried it at 3 different points in my life and have had the same experience each time...NOT GOOD. I tried the medication 3 times because the doctor and I thought that perhaps the side effects were from a mix of other medications I took with the pill. I did have weight loss but it was not worth it at all. I could barely drive and soft drinks (although not really important) tasted amazingly disgusting. I had no warning about all of the things I might experience and it was horrible trying to teach middle school, raise two young children, do daily tasks, and drive. I&#039;ve had friends get divorced due to side effects.""",6
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and at first there was a lot of peeling. And one day I think I used too much and my cheecks became inflamed and irritated. It looked like I had a really bad sun burn in the fall. As of right now this gel has only made my skin worst. I have dark marks on my cheeks and in the corner of my mouth. I look horrible! These reviews say to keep going and be patient. But if I don&#039;t see results soon I will be forced to stop.""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I took Accutane 10 years ago while I was in high school. It&#039;s amazing what it did for my skin. The only side effect I had while taking it was a lot of really bad nightmares. After ten years my skin is still clear. I think I had my first pimple 6 or 7 years after taking it and only 1 more since then. I was on the lowest dose for 9 months. I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome a few years after taking Accutane though, which can be a side effect. It worked wonders for my skin so if your acne is severe and you&#039;ve tried numerous other products that don&#039;t work I would recommend taking Accutane.""",4
Finacea,Acne,"""27 yr old male and never had acne until a yr ago. Initially, I thought it was stress or something short term that would go away. It never went away and the last yr I tried everything Imaginable: OTC acne meds, changed my diet numerous times; cut out all sugar, ate only organic food. Quit exercising to see if sweat was causing it. I did everything possible.I never had acne and could not figure out why at 26/27 it started. I finally went to the dermatologist and was put on Retin A, this made my acne 20x worse. Gave me cystic acne everywhere. I used it for over a month but could not take it anymore. Luckily my mom had Finacea. Within a day I saw results and within a week it was all gone. My face is perfect. I wish I had more room to say how great it is.""",4
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""Best diet pill so far. I&#039;ve been on 25mg twice a day for a week and I&#039;m loving it. I&#039;m usually not good on any medication. Even some medications for my stomach can make me feel dizzy and weird. I&#039;m so happy with Tenuate. I don&#039;t feel nothing but like a good feeling. I&#039;m way more energetic. My mouth is always dry but I&#039;m drinking a lot of water so it&#039;s ok. I haven&#039;t felt dizzy at all. Haven&#039;t had any weird heart beat. Nothing. I&#039;m eating half of what I was eating before I was put on Tenuate.  So far so good!""",2
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I found zolpidem to be extremely effective in the treatment of my insomnia. I didn&#039;t feel any short-term side-affects, and I don&#039;t believe that it may have produced any long-term ones.
As prescribed by my doctor, I didn&#039;t use zolpidem on a daily basis, thus, my review should not be taken optimistically by people who do or will take it on a daily basis. I treated zolpidem as an &quot;emergency&quot; complement to my daily dosage of lorazepam. I found it to be most effective when combined with lorazepam, and from personal experience, no short or long-term side-effects ever revealed themselves from such combination.""",0
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Works great for GAD.  I fought my feelings for years and just toughed it out.  I found myself drinking to ease my symptoms.  The drinking helped turn my brain off for the night, but the feelings just came back the next day.  Finally told my doctor about my symptoms and was prescribed Lexapro.  Within 48 hours the anxiety was dramatically reduced, no excessive sweating, mind racing, etc.  This drug is a god send.  10 mg works best for me, tried 20 but couldn&#039;t feel the difference.  Now just have to deal with the drinking.""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I haven&#039;t been able to fall asleep until after 2 or 3am for about a year, even if I was extremely tired I would just lie in bed for hours. I would be lucky if I got 3-5 hours of sleep a night. My doctor prescribed me Ambien 2 weeks ago. I&#039;ve been getting the best sleep ever. I even wake up after 6-8 hours fully refreshed and awake. I&#039;m just happy to be getting a normal sleep. This really works. I have no stories of waking up in the middle of the night doing odd things.""",0
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been on Vyvanse for a year. I take 50mg now and I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s a miracle drug, but over the past year I have attended more classes and gotten more consistent grades in university. I definitely have to put in the effort to experience the benefits; it&#039;s not motivation/focus-in-a-pill for me! The side effects I&#039;ve experienced are increased anxiety, dry mouth, increased perfectionism, irritability, and some insomnia. Its impact on my mood varies. At first, my appetite decreased and I had terrible afternoon crashes, but they have levelled out over time. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons for me. I haven&#039;t tried anything except for Wellbutrin, which I still take. Not sure how they interact.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am on day 15 of taking Contrave. I took one pill/day for the first 10 days &amp; have been on 2/day for these last 5. Days 1-6: gnawing headache at least once/day; insatiable thirst; significant constipation. During that time, I had decreased appetite, but I think that may have been due to the constipation-there is just nowhere for the food to go! After &quot;clearing&quot; things out with miralax I have a more normal, healthy appetite. No urge to binge and know when to stop. When I started 2 pills per day, I was again very thirsty, which is better in the last day or so. No headache with the increased dose. Down 2.4lbs, but I haven&#039;t exercised at all, so &quot;only&quot; 2.4lbs in 15days is perfectly fine with me. I look forward to seeing the long-term results.""",2
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I have been on Cymbalta for almost 4 years now and it has been a lifesaver for me.  The first few weeks I had some loose stools, but that subsided.  The only problem I have with it now is keeping weight off.  I have trouble loosing weight and I think it is due to the Cymbalta.  I eat a well balanced diet and exercise.  However, due to the numerous medicines I had tried before that failed me for anxiety and depression, I will keep taking the Cymbalta.  I&#039;d rather be fat then feel the way I felt before.""",7
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been really pleased with the way vyvanse has helped me. On Vyvanse I&#039;m not moody or lifeless like I had been on other drugs. My appetite is still very small and this is kind of a problem because I&#039;m really light anyways. However, if I eat before I take it and snack on healthy things during school hours I don&#039;t crash when it wears off. With Vyvanse I&#039;ve realized it&#039;s possible to control my ADD and keep my personality! I was VERY nervous about starting a new drug, but Vyvanse is really the best thing I&#039;ve tried and my grades in my AP classes are better than they have ever been.""",1
Strattera,ADHD,"""I have tried a variety of medications for ADD; including Ritalin, Adderall, Adderall XR, Dexedrine, and Strattera. Each has benefits along with side effects. 

After several years medicating with central nervous system stimulants (CNS) I  switched to Strattera. I found the medication took a few weeks to take effect, and tended to cause constipation. I also found my psychological state was less effective if I became dehydrated. 

To counter the side effects I added All-Bran into my diet twice a week, and drank more liquids. The big benefit for myself was I could enjoy reading books again, which I could not on the CNS stimulants.""",1
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""The first time I took Latuda was in the hospital and I was put on 40 mg. I had a little nausea, but no other side effects. Later my psychiatrist raised the dose to 80 mg. That&#039;s when I started having severe akathisia and vomiting (no weight gain or loss though). It seemed almost intolerable, but I stuck with it for several months. I then switched to Abilify but soon was taken off antipsychotics all together. I was stable for several months, but then started having mania again. Recently, my psychiatrist recommended that I try Latuda at a smaller dose. I was skeptical, but I decided to try it. I love it! The dose is just enough to control my symptoms, and I&#039;ve had no side effects. My new insurance is denying it though, so I&#039;m on samples.""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had this IUD for about 5 months. I experienced the worst cramping of my life with this IUD, at times nearly bringing me to tears. I would have cramping with things like working out and after intercourse, and also at random times. These cramps were completely debilitating. I also continued to have my period every month, as well as spotting. It seemed as though the spotting was starting to get better, but the intense, severe cramping persisted so my GYN agreed that it should be removed. Now I&#039;m trying mini pills. I&#039;m unable to use estrogen containing birth control due to a blood clot while on combo pill.""",8
Atralin,Acne,"""About 5 months ago I had a MAJOR breakout on my chin. I&#039;m 27, never had a problem with acne before. I&#039;d been through a number of topical creams and antibiotics, without any result. If anything, the breakout was worse. I was a few weeks away from starting Accutane, when as a last resort my doctor gave me Atralin. It took about two weeks before I saw much of an improvement, but it works wonderfully. It didn&#039;t burn like any of the other topical creams and didn&#039;t make it worse before better, like most of the other ones. I&#039;ve been using the Atralin for a couple of months now and my skin has cleared up completely. I have had maybe two or three very small blemishes since then, and even those are gone within a day or two. I highly recommend it!""",4
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Doctor suggested Saxenda and this is week 4 @ increased the injection to 2.4. Total loss is 6.5 kilos.  Side effects are extreme tiredness, constipation &amp; heart burn. Due to knee replacement 10 months ago &amp; fractured back I&#039;m limited to exercise so walk every day &amp; night &amp; incl hill climbs. I eat 1000 calories per day &amp; satisfied. However this week I have developed red welts at the injection site. I&#039;ve put ice on it but as yet will not subside &amp; concerned about another injection. I can&#039;t see my doctor till next week so was wondering if anyone else had this experience &amp; why?""",2
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""This is my first experience with birth control and it had been very positive. I did have some bloating and mood swings in the first couple of weeks, but my doctor said it was normal because my body was adjusting to the drug. I used to have horrible acne that nothing would cure, but the pill has cleared almost all of it up. The acne did get worse for me at first, but it takes time to work. I also used to have severe cramping and now I have none.""",8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I was skeptical at first reading quite a few bad reviews about depression and suicidal thoughts but I had no choice, I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. The first few months on the small dose had little effect and little side effect so they increased my dosage and my acne, day by day, disappeared. Spot by spot. I used it for 6 months and I was done, it&#039;s been a year and I&#039;ve not had one spot since. I got very bad dry skin and a little bit of depression whilst on the drug, that&#039;s now gone as well.

If you are thinking about this drug but are hesitating like I did, I say you go for it. It changed my life, without sounding clich""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been taking phentermine since January. I wanted my health back on track so my doctor recommended this drug. I have been working out 4 times a week for an hour. I was 260lbs and am now 212lbs. Doctor still wants me to get down to at least 170lbs so he can take my off some of my medicines and keep me in maintenance program for about 9 months. I drink lots of water, count my calories and exercise. No complaints, just happy my health is much better.""",3
Orlistat,Obesity,"""The moment I hit 30, my metabolism slowed. Despite working out and eating healthy, I felt bloated after I ate and I was irregular. I really felt like my body was overloaded and not processing things at a normal speed but I felt lethargic and hungry so I was starting to get depressed over the whole thing. I tried diuretics/lax and increasing fiber to no avail and the cramping sucked. 

This is making a real difference. I feel leaner and lighter and my joints aren&#039;t so overtaxed carrying the extra weight. My energy is way better. It&#039;s messy at times and not easy but if you have two weeks of down time where you can be by the bathroom, give this a go.""",2
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Anger. Anxiety. Stomach in a knot. Wanting to die. Then I take my Klonopin and a warm feeling envelops me. I&#039;m suddenly calm. I&#039;m reasonable and rational. The violence in my heart temporarily melts away. I&#039;m not angry anymore. I take a short vacation from misery. Then I blissfully drift off to sleep. I won&#039;t take it often because I don&#039;t want to become addicted. But when things get unbearable, my Klonopin soothes my racing mind.""",7
Dapsone,Acne,"""Im 19 years old and have had acne since about the 6th grade (age 11). About a month ago I went to a new dermatologist who took one look at me and said shes going to prescribe me Retin-A.  I told her that I tried that and she said Aczone was the last one she could think of that could possibly help me.  So far after three weeks my forehead and left cheek has cleared up (but I still have acne scars).  The right cheek doesn&#039;t seem to be getting better or worse, the pimples I had went away and others came. Hoping for more results with time.""",4
Hyzine,Anxiety,"""I took it like I was supposed to for anxiety and panic disorder. it did nothing absolutely nothing. I&#039;m in worse shape now than I ever was. doctors please get a grip you can&#039;t treat us for just anything it&#039;s like trying to treat athletes feet with dandruff shampoo .We are people we know that you&#039;re not supposed to get attached to it.  the medicine sucks doesn&#039;t help sleep doesn&#039;t help panic disorder doesn&#039;t help insomnia doesn&#039;t help anxiety. I&#039;m not sneezing -  I didn&#039;t go in for an antihistamine.  Do you think that Google won&#039;t tell us everything. It didn&#039;t take long to figure out I mean nothing. write a  proper prescription""",7
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""My OB recommended this for my insomnia/racing thoughts at night in pregnancy. Took 25 mg and was out w/in 30 minutes and tired the next day. Cut down to 1/2 a pill and was much better. Haven&#039;t gotten a full nights sleep in 6 months and was losing my mind, it completely fixed that. I will say that if I don&#039;t drink lots of water with it I get terrible headaches but as long as I stay hydrated and give myself 8 hours to sleep I am ready and wake up right away with my alarm in the best mood I&#039;ve had since the pregnancy started.""",0
Methadone,Pain,"""I have been on methadone since 1998 and it&#039;s the best pain reliever on the market today. I have been prescribed almost everything for my pain and nothing would touch it. It might have taken the pain away for a short period of time, then I would have to take another pill. Methadone is unique because it has what the doctors call a (HALF LIFE), This means when you take methadone it doesn&#039;t (PEAK) out in 2-4 hours, it last the whole day. Like other pain pills such as Oxycontin, Vicodin, Demerol, or any other opiate, they Peak out at about 2-4 hours. In the last ten plus years I have been taking Methadone, I have been able to function, do normal day to day operations, and even maintain a full-time job. Methadone is the best pain pill out there.""",9
Clindamycin,Acne,"""I used to have lots of pimples all over my forehead and temples when I was 10 and kinda went on till I was about 12 or 13 that my skin cleared up. Later on a few months after I turned 20 I started to get bumps on my forehead again, not really pimples just bumps (occasionally 1 or 2 pimples) after a few months with this problem I went to my doctor and she prescribed me clindamycin. ITS AMAZING! Just the first night many of my bumps were gone! I&#039;m on my 4th day now and my skin is clearing up pretty good, the only down side is the dryness it leaves you with. With a good moisturizer that problem it&#039;s fixed.""",4
Risperdal,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication saved my life. Tried several different medicines over 10 years and none have worked better than Risperdal. I take escitalopram as well and have seen fantastic results. If I miss a dose I can tell very quickly within a few days as I don&#039;t sleep and feel really agitated and angry at the least little thing. Really helped control my mood swings and this combination has been great for me.""",6
Citalopram,Depression,"""My doctor put me on this medicine for depression.  I have known for quite a while I was depressed but I never told anyone. I feel better already.  Took my first dose today.  It works quickly. I am not crying all day, not worrying all day and I feel better TODAY. This is not in my mind. It really does work. I imagine within a week I will notice a really big difference.  Depression had caused me not to want to do anything at all.  Going to work was even almost impossible.  Now I found some help.""",5
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I took 1(one) 25mg tablet. I haven&#039;t been sleeping well so thought I would try this. I did fall asleep within about 30 minutes. I awoke about 6 hours later and my room was literally spinning. I was so dizzy feeling I could barely get to the bathroom and then back to bed. I fell back to sleep quickly which for me is unusual. I slept for another 3-4 hours. When I awoke I was still quite dizzy feeling but not like when I had woke up previously. That was 5 days ago. I have had dizziness since I took that one  pill and have not taken any more. I must be extremely sensitive to this medication. I have also had some nausea this whole time.""",0
Diphenhydramine,Insomnia,"""I have used Sominex for YEARS and I absolutely love it!!!  I am NEVER groggy in the morning.  It allows me to sleep, then if I have to go to the bathroom during the night, I am able to go back to sleep.  I take it generally every night.  When I have spoken to various doctors over the years, they have never seemed concerned about my long term use.
Nothing else works quite like it, and it definitely improves my quality of life as I simply cannot function if I don&#039;t get enough sleep.  I usually have to order it online because it is not always stocked at the stores that I go to.  Hope this helps.  Sweet Dreams. :)""",0
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""This medication so far has been working quite well for me. I just finished my first 2 week dose today and I am down 16 pounds. The first week felt like I was starving with the diet the nutritionist had put me on , but into the second week that faded away and I was satisfied with my smaller portions. I had less interest in food and felt fuller faster. Tomorrow I will begin the the next dose up of the medication and I am looking forward to seeing how much weigh loss is in store for me. I was told by the doctor today that the medicine is designed to help you lose 5 percent of your total weight loss. So my next visit with her she expects another 10 pounds which will put me at 26 pounds in 6 weeks that is more than what she originally expected""",3
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I have been taking this medication for about 5 years on and off since my husband passed away suddenly.  It works very well for me no side effects I take it as needed only.  It&#039;s prescribed 0.25 2 x a day as needed.  I take half of that whenever I get anxious and feel my heart racing it stops it right away if I find myself anxious at night I take the other half.  I go days without it as well.  The trick is not to use it all the time.  Just knowing I have it helps me relax in case I should need it.  All meds are addicting if taken all the time.""",7
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Been on it since February 2014, at first when I got it, I had my period for 3weeks none stop then my GP gave me some medication to stop the bleeding,  since then my period never came back which is good.  But I moved to a new country and I think of climate change, I had my period for two weeks but they eventually stopped.  Down side is my sex drive is out of the window, I am not as &#039;wet&#039; as I used to be, making sex uncomfortable. After sex I get some spotting each time. I haven&#039;t noticed any weight gain as I was already overweight when I got it. No acne or moods,  but still crave my chocolate""",8
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""Do not prescribe this to anyone !! This drug should not be legal. After 2 weeks it made me feel suicidal, which I&#039;ve never been in my entire 33 yrs of being alive. It swung me into a severe depression and accumulated a huge amount of anxiety. This is the most unhealthy experience I have ever had. It ruined my relationship and my personality when I was taking it. I started a college class and the doctor prescribed this to me for concentration. It made me feel like I was on speed. When I stopped taking it about 6 days later I was a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT person, I was finally back to normal. Please watch your children or anyone you know who may be taking this.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking this drug prescribed by my doctor on 6/21/16. I had started a diet the previous week of only fruit and vegetables.  I dropped a good 8 pounds from that.  I started medication and it has helped my appetite control.  I took one full pill every day for a week.  I started walking a lot.  A good 2-3 miles a day.  I also kept with eating fruit in morning and low carb/protein during the rest of the day.  I have had to drop down to half a pill because of insomnia and have noticed constipation.  I am on weight watchers now and follow the plan.  I eat fruit and vegetables like crazy and I know it helps the weight loss.  I am down 13 pounds as of 7/8/16.  I am sure I will start to lose 1-2 pounds a week soon which is the healthy way.""",3
Endocet,Pain,"""Like any pain pill, it will vary GREATLY on side effects and effectiveness with each patient. For me, I have been on 10/325 for 2 years for chronic pain from an injury. Before that I had been prescribed Hydrocodone and the side effects from that for ME were alot like what I&#039;ve seen people here say about hydrocodone. I got a tolerance very quickly and would have to take more, I was very agitated, extremely exhausted, and even with all of that I would still be unable to be productive due to pain. I&#039;ve tried some other things before this also, but nothing was helping. I STILL have pain, and yes, some days nothing seems to ease it, on those REALLY BAD days, but I am really happy with this medicine still being effective 2 yrs later.""",9
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication saved my life. Tried several different medicines over 10 years and none have worked better than Risperdal. I take escitalopram as well and have seen fantastic results. If I miss a dose I can tell very quickly within a few days as I don&#039;t sleep and feel really agitated and angry at the least little thing. Really helped control my mood swings and this combination has been great for me.""",6
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on 20mg Saphris for 4 weeks, after taking 10mg for three weeks.  I wish I had the amazing results you people have had.  I would love to have the happy feelings you speak of.  After seven weeks I still have a dazed feeling and difficulty processing information.  I am waiting for my depression to lift.  I take other mood stabilizers including lithium.  I&#039;m afraid Saphris may be yet another failed attempt for me.  The nasty taste and numb tongue are little bother for me, if it would just work.""",6
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have multiple hernias in my low back and neck. My doctor abruptly stopped my Vicodin because I had used it long term and was losing the effect of pain relief. Started Ultram 400mg a day. No withdrawal symptoms from Vicodin. My pain level though didn&#039;t improve from the Vicodin. I still feel the same as I did as the last few months of Vicodin use. I have had bad withdrawal symptoms in the past from fentanyl and am a little worried about having to come off Ultram someday as it appears to be hard to come off of. So basically it works like weak Vicodin for me and I have had some erectile dysfunction symptoms as well. I saw someone else comment on that. I&#039;m young and never had any type of problems. I also take Lyrica 150mg three times a day.""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started contrave on May 18th and I am down 13lbs!! I am so excited about that. I have not been exercising but have significantly cut down my calories and fat intake. Today I start my second week and should be starting my second pill, 1 in the am and 1 in the pm. However I&#039;m going to stick to one pill for another week or so. In the beginning, I would say the first 3 days I did have nausea and a headache. My head hurt for 3 days straight! I really thought my body wasn&#039;t going to tolerate the medication. The nausea wasn&#039;t was tolerable but the headache seemed to start off light and then by around 5pm I swear it felt like it had its own heartbeat! But the 4th day I woke up and I felt normal again. I will be checking back in a week or so.""",2
Topamax,Obesity,"""I have struggled with weight loss for years.  Food cravings are one of my &quot;symptoms.&quot;  Topamax really did help with this, however my energy and memory are not what they use to be.  Originally I thought it was a trade off I could adjust to but the fuzzy memory for me is frustrating.  I sometimes say words that I am thinking about and don&#039;t even realize it.  Then argue that I didn&#039;t say it, only to find out I did. Silly, but worth revisitng my physician about.  I struggle with the same 10-20 lbs but won&#039;t give up. I would recommend trying it to people who are serious about weight loss.  It helps you push your plate away and not obsess about food.  That was an experience I had never had before, but I need my memory.""",2
Accutane,Acne,"""I took accutane for 4 months with amazing results when I was 16. I had severe acne on my cheeks, chin, and temples and it all cleared up w/ just some light marks and scars left over. My skin remained clear for about 6 months after I stopped taking it and I didn&#039;t have to use any topic treatments. The acne returned slowly with a few small bumps and got the point where it was just as severe as before. Now, a little over a year from when I started my first round, I am on accutane again. Now, I am about a month into my treatment and I see fantastic results. This second round is better than the first; the first time, I experienced an initial flare up, this second time, it immediately got better.""",4
Strattera,ADHD,"""I started taking this medication about 2 months ago. My doc had me start out at 40 milligrams for one week and then upped the dose to two 40 mg capsules twice a day. At the second month, I started taking just one 80 mg capsule around mid-afternoon early evening every day. So far the drug has seemed to greatly help my ability to focus and really experience the world around me. I&#039;m able to finally slow my mind to a cruising speed instead of an outright race. Strattera has made me calmer and more composed when it comes to social interactions with others and encountering stressful situations. Also, I seem to be getting really positive and more optimistic in everyday life making me feel as if the drug as some mild antidepressant properties""",1
Dexedrine,ADHD,"""My experience is limited since I have only been on this medication for a few days.  I am a medical resident, diagnosed with ADHD at 32. Got sick and tired of my mediocre performance at work. Tried Straterra, Viibryd and Wellbutrin, nothing worked. Just started on Dexedrine 5mg 2-3 times a day. My first day on it, I studied all day until midnight. I was so motivated, I felt great, on top of the world, I was so driven. I noticed an immediate difference in my performance at work and it made me a nicer, less cynical. The bad thing was insomnia, teeth clenching, some nausea, decreased appetite and the drop in my mood once it wore off. I am worried about intolerance which is driving up my anxiety level. """,1
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started taking the pill for obesity Nov. 28th  weighing 433 and by Dec. 18th I weighed in at 415. Today is Dec 28th and I&#039;m at 409. I&#039;m loving this pill, feeling and my new scale (Ozeri Precision Pro Max). My Doctor recommended the pill because of my obesity and high blood pressure. When I first started taking this pill I had slight chest pains as I&#039;m only taking half of the 37.5 tablet I was prescribed. I was a lot jittery and I had nightmares so I stopped taking them for a week and then got back on them the next week. Now I&#039;m fine, no chest pains and I have a lot of energy when I&#039;m active and at the gym, but my energy is low when I take them and don&#039;t workout. Overall, I&#039;m happy with the results, I&#039;m eating better, and looking better.""",2
Minocycline,Acne,"""Used to be so miserable all the time because of my severe acne. It would be the last thing on my mind before I would fall asleep and the first thing on my mind as soon as I would wake up. All the different face washes weren&#039;t working at all. Decided to tell my parents I was feeling depressed from my acne and they took me to see a dermatologist. Right away they prescribed be minocycline. This stuff has been magic for me so far, it&#039;s been about a year and a half since I started it. I have went from severe acne to basically clear, glowing skin. And another great thing about it is that I have experienced zero side effects. If you are fed up with your acne, this is your solution I can promise you that. It will change your life and confidence!!!""",4
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on deep depression. Effexor was not working any more and was having deep suicidal thought. Then my doctor added Latuda 40 mg. Miracle! No more suicidal thought and my bipolar depression ceased by 80%. The only problem is make me sleep when I take in the morning and make me awake when I take it at supper. Taking it at lunch causes a little less sleepiness. Another feature is that it control my severe anxiety.""",6
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I have been on and off Cymbalta for about 3 years. Just today after visiting with my Doctor and with my husbands honest feedback (he was there with me), I realized that I have to go back on it. So I&#039;m going off Wellbutrin, which had worked great in the past. Cymbalta really is the best anti-depressent that I have tried, and I have tried a lot.  The only reasons I ever went off it in the past was the bloated feeling I felt and weight gain.  So I am committing to eating better (watch calorie intake and get off the carbs) and excercising.  Going to go buy a treadmill tomorrow. Keeping my fingers crossed that I&#039;m able to stay on it for good this time.""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Vyvanse changed my life for the better. I&#039;ve been taking it for almost 2 years now and I honestly don&#039;t know where my life would be headed or where I&#039;d end up without it, but looking at the direction it was going in before I got diagnosed with ADD, I wouldn&#039;t have gone far and probably ended up as a loser. I can finally read a book and know what I read or do my homework on my own! Since this medication; I stopped making stupid choices, went from D&#039;s to all B&#039;s. It helped my depression and it changed my life dramatically. My relationship with my friends and family has grown stronger. Before Vyvanse I pictured my future as a druggy, now I have a job and I am looking forward to becoming a vet.""",1
Escitalopram,Depression,"""Out of nowhere, due to what they think is genetics, I got hit with depression, anxiety, and a form of OCD in my early twenties. The Lexapro was a life saver. Although, I still have negative thoughts on a daily basis, I&#039;m able to cope, and I&#039;m not miserable like I was. However, there is one common downside to this medicine that has left me terribly upset and frustrated. I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for a year and a half now and have put on about 20 lbs. I work out almost every day and eat right for the most part. I have not shed a pound. I&#039;ve never been this big before and to me, I feel as though Lexapro isn&#039;t worth it anymore. I&#039;m weening off of it with my doctor&#039;s help, and am going to try and cope with my issues with different methods.""",5
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""my hubby has been on the  med since Sept 2015.   It is not working..  they  put him on the Gaba to remove the morphine.  In the last 4 weeks  by 11pm he is wide awake in pain and in tears.  In the last 2 weeks the heavy pressure on  his right side just below the shoulder is worse each time.  He has developed a cold  that will not go away  starting in Nov. We see the Doc on Feb 3rd. He is taking a sleep aid  and med for really bad  headaches.  I am  so  afraid of what will happen when  the next dose falls.   We have been married for 24 years.  He  has had problems with drugs and drink all his life  from 9 years of age on..  yep   .. people  9 years of age..  Started smoking pot and drinking.. """,0
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I started Belviq on May 10th.  I have lost 20 lbs since, today being 8/5.  I wanted something to aid in my weight loss  being 200 lbs, 5&#039;2&quot;, 52 yrs old.  I asked about Contrave but my doc suggested Belviq because of patient success.   I had nausea and a headache for 3 days but that went away.  I also had  a nagging cough for a couple months but that went away, also.  The only other notable symptoms are occasional sluggishness and brain fog.  I take two 10 mg pills a day.  I know when the first one&#039;s wearing off  because I do get hungry.  It does curb my appetite really well and I have to force myself to eat. I have the most success when I work out, too and cut down on sugar and food intake which Belviq aids in.  I love it!""",3
Adderall,ADHD,"""I have been taking Adderal  for 2 years now (3 of the 30mg tablets a day). It&#039;s a great way to get your work done in school and anything else you may need motivation to do. It also makes me more social and interesed in things I wouldn&#039;t normally be interested in.
The bad thing about it is that if you go even one day without it you eat 3 times more than you usually would and you feel irritable and agitated.

overall- coudlnt live without it""",1
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have tried taking lithium twice - when I was a teenager &amp; as an adult. Both times it didn&#039;t do much for me. I still experienced mood swings &amp; I gained a lot of weight. I also developed thyroid problems &amp; had very bad tremors. This is not a medication I would recommend. If you do decide to take lithium make sure to get your your doctor to give you blood tests regularly, so you can check on your liver, thyroid, etc. It is very important.""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I love this pill I take a whole pill every morning. I have lots of energy! I started 3 days ago and I have lost 7 pounds since then. It curves my appetite all day until about 5:00pm then I normally eat a piece of grilled chicken and drink water! But I would definitely say that you need to work out along with it because I think that&#039;s how mine is dropping so fast! My doctor told me that if he doesn&#039;t think a patient is losing what they should, he stops prescribing it.""",3
Duac,Acne,"""Prescribed by the doctor as after coming off the pill I broke out in spots. First time I used it I had a severe reaction. I felt a burning &amp; tight sensation on my face, looked in the mirror &amp; it looked like I had been burnt. I took an antihistamine straight away. Nothing changed after 2 hours so attended the hospital who advised me that I had received the worst allergic reaction they had ever seen. """,4
Citalopram,Depression,"""Citalopram has felt like a complete and utter blessing in my life. I feel like a normal person for the first time in years! It started working for me after two days. At first I felt really happy but now I just feel level and happy like any other person. I was so ashamed about my anxiety and depression and tried to cope with it for years. I am so glad that I finally went to my G.P for help. I know now that I can cope with my thoughts/life. Nothing has really changed practically but I now have a positive outlook. I can cope! Friends and family can see the difference and I am no longer suicidal. I don&#039;t mind the side effect of yawning plus I can still drink but don&#039;t crave it as much. If you are depressed and reading this I&#039;d say give it a go.""",5
Fentanyl,Pain,"""I injured my back about 6 years ago.  I was put on all kinds of medicines until I met the best doctor in the world.  The doctor put me on the patch and it was the first time in 6 years that there was no pain at all.  But now the doctor is gone and no one else wants to write a prescription for the patch so I was left to suffer withdrawal for the first time in my life.  Great medicine but it will make you go through withdrawal and trust me it isn&#039;t fun. Many doctors are afraid to write the prescription for this medicine.""",9
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m a middle aged woman.  Along with my first hot flash about 10 years ago, came the weight gain.  Since 2008 I had gained about 50 lbs.  Then, in the summer of 2016, I was in a clinical trial for Dasotraline. By the time Phase 1 had ended, I had gained 30 lbs, now weighed 225.  I&#039;ve tried every combo of diet and exercise through the years,  I threw in the towel and was basically waiting to die. About 3 weeks ago, my head popped out of my butt and I decided I deserved to be happy and healthy.  Back in the gym, clean eating, and no diet soda.  The scale did not move. I had my physical.  Doc prescribed Qsymia.  Insurance did not cover.  My 1st weeks was reduced to $60 not free!!  I&#039;ve been on for 3 days.  No changes yet  I&#039;l keep you posted""",3
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I am 23 and have had extreme anxiety/panic since around 20.  I am super sensitive to meds/ side effects.  I have tried so many AD and none have worked.  Recently I have tried Remeron but had to switch due to drowsiness- I have hypersomnia.  Lexapro by far has taken away my worrying mind more than anything which is amazing.  The first month was pretty horrid besides that though.  Constant nausea, yawning, worsened anxiety at first, headaches.  I still have some nausea and now I have noticed extreme drowsiness again. I really love how it helps my anxiety, but (like always) the side effects really bother me.  Try it out, get thru the 1st month. If you don&#039;t have bad side effects its the best anxiety med I have ever had.  Good luck!""",7
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Depakote does wonders for me but have heard it&#039;s not well for others. I don&#039;t get many of the side effects except for the weight gain. But let&#039;s face it, why am I gaining weight? Because I&#039;m not as stressed out anymore. I try and use it to my advantage being a weight lifter/exercise nut. Which is also a good thing for someone dealing with anxiety and depression by the way. I do have to say when I want to read something I can without having to go back and read it over again because I just had 33 1/2 things run through my head during the last sentence. I&#039;m not saying it is for everyone but for me it is life changing. I hope this helps in your quest for finding the right script. I know it can be hell working it all out, but trust me you will get there!""",6
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I started with the the sample in may 2016 I&#039;m on my 5th week on it at 3.0. Until now I didn&#039;t lose weight at all but I did lost my appetite.  I have PCOs that I control with metformin and pre diabetes that I control with diet and exercise. Right now I am having a pretty severe side effect as I am tired all the time and my period stopped. In the beginning I had nausea, vomiting, dizziness slow digestion and sensation that something is in my throat at all times. Going for a doctor appointment soon to assess if it&#039;s  worth to keep using it.""",3
Ambien,Insomnia,"""When it works, it works well with no next day grogginess.  I am a long time user, beginning in 2001.  I have pretty much stopped, after using it every night for 9 years.  I have tried Lunesta and I sleep two hours even with double dose.  Rozerem had no effect.  I may be trying Seroquel next.  I had night-time events with no memory of them. I typically had one event every few months, but some were potentially deadly.  Yes, I too cooked all the time with no memory of it.  I would wake up and crack eggs in the sink and food on the table.  I also (VERY IMPORTANT), would go on line, send e mail that was highly damaging and/or embarrassing and have no memory of doing it until I got responses. ALSO NIGHT DRIVING WITH NO MEMORY of the event.""",0
Aczone,Acne,"""I had cystic acne on my jaw line and cheeks from almost 2 years. Have been using many medications like benzoyl peroxide creams, salicylic acid and over the counter creams. But nothing was working out. 2 months back I went to another dermatologist and she prescribed me Aczone cream to use 2 times a day. 
It really worked for me.  Within 2 weeks I can make out the difference. New acne almost stopped appearing and even the acne that is trying to come out is clearing up fast. I am so happy that my skin cleared up pretty soon. But if I stop using it for few days, acne start coming back again. Also the scars are still there. I think they are fading a little, but still not completely. I am happy my doctor prescribed me this.""",4
Percocet,Pain,"""I take this for the bad days of my chronic pain syndrome that my doctor won&#039;t give an official diagnosis, but basically the symptoms are like those of fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndromes.  We&#039;ve ruled out everything else!  Anyway, I also take it for migraines, as I unfortunately don&#039;t tolerate the typical medicines for those.  As long as I really moderate how much and how often I take it, the pain is much more tolerable.  Not gone, but much better than it would otherwise be without it!  The downside to this drug (like all of the other opiates) is that I&#039;ve built a tolerance to it over the years.  Fortunately have never become physically dependent on it!  I find that it is better for me than Vicodin or Darvocet because it has less gastrointestinal side effects.""",9
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on 200mg of lamotrigine for 5 years. I also take 50mg of seroquel at bedtime which also helps immensely with my insomnia. And yes, it took a moment to pull that last word our of my brain and I do goof up words sometimes, but so do all the other alcoholics I know and love. I self medicated for many years and it worked even better after quitting 2 years ago. I still am a little manic, and vaguely depressed under stress, but this treatment has been a lifesaver. I highly recommend giving it a try if your unhappy with your current regimen, but you&#039;ll have to give it time. It took me about 6 months to get the full benefit.""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;m a 35 year old male with a BMI of 40, healthy blood pressure and no diabetes. Last year I was diagnosed with Binge Eating disorder. Cognitive therapy and DBT has been extremely helpful with my condition, but it&#039;s not 100%.  Contrave has provided that extra bit of a safety net that I need when I&#039;m struggling.  It doesnt make me less hungry, but the Naltrexone blocks the positive feedback from my overeating,  stopping the cycle and helping to break my unhealthy associations with food.  I&#039;ve never experienced nausea while on the full dosage.  The main drawback for me is that Contrave is expensive since my insurance does not cover it.  Considering asking my doctor if we can titrate me on a similar dose of generic Naltrexone and Bupropion.""",2
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve just switched to Klonopin from being on Xanax for almost 11 years. It worked WONDERS for me. I never abused it and take it responsibly, but I did develop a tolerance to it after so long on it. One of the best things about Xanax is that it kicks in pretty quickly, which is a must for panic attacks. It&#039;s very hard for me to let Xanax go because it&#039;s the only thing that really worked for my anxiety and panic attacks.""",7
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""Bipolar 2 with psychotic features (voices/some visual when it&#039;s real bad) Week 3 of Latuda now on 120mg to replace 800mg of Seroquel. Last dose of Seroquel will be this Thursday. Taking Lithium, Lamictal (I like this one too), Topamax, several more psych meds as required, and asthma meds. Latuda is GREAT! My mood is slightly on the manic side, but sleep is perfect, so a little (safe) fun is just fine by me. Everybody around me has noticed the change. I&#039;ll let things settle for a couple months and ask the psych to drop the Topamax some (I think it messes with my memory at 300mg). So far no weight loss on the Latuda like the rest of you seem to have noticed, but the rest is so great, I&#039;m all in.""",6
Butrans,Pain,"""It works pretty well for me until it starts to wear off on the 5-7th day. I think there should be 5 patches given a month instead of 4 per 28 days. Or the manufacturer needs to improve the quality and lasting power of each patch. 

I do have to admit without this medication, i would be unable to have a normal life. My pain level would be about an 8 on average without it, and thank goodness I was referred to my doctor by my orthopedic surgeon. I occasionally have a little itch under the patch when it gets wet. I hate that it is not more waterproof. I believe this is part of the reason they lose their strength. I do have Norco to supplement my pain relief, but if the patches would hold their potency, i wouldn&#039;t have to use the Norco.""",9
Tramadol,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been on tramadol 50 my 3x day for 7 years now for arthritis. It&#039;s a very good pain relief it also helps sleep good an helps with my anxiety issues. But my tolerance level started to get high after a year of taking it. It stop working good so I had to start taking four a day, then ended up finding out I&#039;m having withdrawal symptoms which is VERY TERRIBLE thing to go through. I suggest if anyone taking this... *WARNING* if u feel like it not working anymore and you&#039;ve been taking it for a long period of time stop taking them that means your getting addicted. Or just take a break from taking them for a bit. Went through hell with the withdrawal from those.""",9
Sonata,Insomnia,"""Started on 10mg for 1 week with little results. Woke up twice every night, seems like it took forever to get back to sleep. Doctor increased dose to 2 
10mg per night-it&#039;s been a month now and I&#039;m still waking up at least twice each night. I have tried taking both capsules around 9-9:30PM, or 1 at 9:30PM &amp; the other around 11PM, same sleep interruptions.  I decided to just get up at 4AM-when I&#039;m awake the second time and stare at the TV or fix my husband&#039;s lunch.  I&#039;m still not feeling as if I&#039;m getting a good night&#039;s sleep-find myself tired and grouchy during the day and early evening. Feeling very frustrated.""",0
Vicodin,Pain,"""Over the past two and a half years since I had major shoulder surgery the recovery has been slow. I&#039;ve recently been diagnosed with arthritis and C6-7 cervical degenerative disc disease with C5-6 and C6-7 narrowing of the neural foramen. I was prescribed naproxen at one point which helped a little. I was taken off of it due to the amount I was taking a day. Up to 3200mg. I was also prescribed ambien because I couldn&#039;t sleep because of the pain. I started to sleep walk on four different occasions where my wife found me elsewhere from where I went to sleep. I called my doc and he took me off and I was prescribed hydrocodone and acetaminophen combo. That was the best thing that could have happened for me. I&#039;m no longer in constant pain.""",9
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""I have been on this medication for over 15 years. I can tell you that this is the absolute best medication for panic attacks, the problem is that I never had any panic attacks until I quit taking the pill after a year of use. I was prescribed this when I was 18 after being hospitalized as the result of several traumatic events. I started on 32 mg and eventually was bumped up to 150mg and then 225 mg. I weened off and survived the withdrawals and felt amazing seriously felt like the best moment of my life but about a year after I stopped taking it, the depression came back twice as bad. """,7
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;m in my 30s and got cystic acne due to beauty medical treatment that stimulated my pimples. Spoken to my cousin who is a Dermatologist suggested me to use Tretinoin cream at night which I tried last night 22.11.17 however I have tried and used so many products already and almost gave up until my Mom&#039;s friend advised me to try crushed aspirin which I apply as mask on areas where I needed it and its a blessing coz its the only thing that actually works.""",4
Solodyn,Acne,"""My close friend&#039;s very healthy 12 year old daughter was on Solodyn for what I would consider mild to moderate acne.  A few weeks ago she started having significant stomach pain.  They thought it was lactose intolerance, then maybe gluten intolerance.  The pain worsened.  Then she became severely constipated.  The doctors did all types of GI testing.  She began vomiting uncontrollably for days on end.  Only upon going to the ER did they find after some blood work specifically checking for liver problems, that she had elevated enzymes.  Scans showed liver enlargement.  They took her off of the Solodyn.  A few days later her liver is showing improvement and she can eat a bit.  Official diagnosis was drug induced liver damage from the Solodyn.""",4
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had severe insomnia for years and have tried everything from diphenhydramine (Benadryl), Ambien, temazapam, and trazodone.

Honestly most of the above work except I have to rotate every few weeks between them.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT, the one sleep aid that works the best for me is a strong dose of Benadryl.  I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep and Benadryl is the one tried and true medicine that works all night. Because of other meds I&#039;m now on, I can&#039;t take it any longer and have to take a prescription sleep aid.""",0
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started phentermine on 7/24/15 at 379.5lbs. Today I weighed in at 363. For a total loss of 16.5lbs in 7 days. The first day I was extremely nauseous, highly energetic, cranky and had dry mouth. The dry mouth and crankiness went away after the first day. I generally eat 2-300 calories and a 300 calorie protein shake with 52g of protein. I supplement with various vitamins and work out. I am hoping to lose another 10 in the next month. Overall I am not even slightly hungry although my disgust for food is starting to wain. Example of meal: Half a piece of cheese, one turkey slice, half a cracker; then I am done. Hoping I can tolerate 2 protein shakes by next week. Working great so far.""",2
Carbamazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Before this, I&#039;d been ineffectively diagnosed and treated for ADHD and recurrent depression. I&#039;ve taken this medication for only four days following a bipolar II re-diagnosis, but despite this, I feel much better than I had on Prozac. My combination of irritability, depression, lack of motivation, and suicidal/homicidal ideation (in the form of intrusive mental images) has vanished, and I find it much easier to talk to people and look them in the eye again. I&#039;m taking 200mg tablets twice a day and initially noticed mild dizziness, headache, and sleepiness, but these quickly vanished. The only persistent symptoms have been hardly perceptible ringing in the ears and lowering in the pitch at which I hear sounds, esp. familiar songs.""",6
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Dissolves very quickly compared to other sub-lingual tablets that I have taken - tastes horrible though! I have experienced no negative side effects, and it has definitely elevated my mood and taken away the &quot;shadows&quot; and some of the &quot;noises&quot; that accompany my diagnosis....overall seems to be much better than the last two meds I was prescribed (Lamictal and Abilify). I give it a ten!""",6
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""This medication is amazing!! Be patient and try it! All ADHD medications (like any other medication for anything) have side-effects but I have learned Concerta&#039;s do go away once you let your body do the talking: push through the 1-6 days of anxiety/depression/hyperactivity, etc., and be open to what it can do for you once your body gets used to it. I am 21 years old and I am on 54mg AND I take a side-effect medication called INTUNIV XR (2mg) that cured the anxiety side-effect which I found to come about half way through the day and when the Concerta was wearing off. This side effect comes about because Concerta is not a gradual release but 2 releases of the medicine- it drops off and may cause anxiety for a short time during the day.""",1
Bupropion,Depression,"""I have major depressive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. I&#039;ve taken Prozac, which made me feel &quot;weird&quot;, Lexapro, which made me a zombie, and then I finally went to a psychiatrist that prescribed me Wellbutrin. The only bad side effects that I have is increased worry/anxiety. He prescribed me Xanax, which only makes me sleepy, and I still have that worried/dread feeling. I went today and he prescribed me clonazepem and told me to try that because it has a longer effect than Xanax. Overall, Wellbutrin has definitely been the best for me as far as my depression goes...I&#039;d rather be anxious than sad.""",5
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had it for two year now. It works great, I haven&#039;t had any surprise pregnancies... But, I have gained 40 lbs since  then despite exercising a 3-5 times a week and controlled eating habits. The first few months I felt really fatigued and got a lot of large acne flare ups and my appetite increased like crazy - I was never satisfied/full. I gained 10 lbs those first few months. I&#039;ve had no bleeding at all, which was nice. Those are my only complaints. I will be getting off the shot bc with all my physical activity and limited eating, I still gain weight :(""",8
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""My sleep doctor prescribed this for me (I have sleep apnea) because I kept waking up at the slightest noise or movement from my husband. I take 100 mg before going to sleep and I can say it has changed my life for the better.  I can sleep for a solid 7 to 8 hours with little drowsiness in the morning.  In addition, it has helped my depression symptoms, although it may also be the better quality of sleep I get.""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Hi I started saxenda on July 27,2016. In those 5 weeks I lost 13lbs. Starting weight was 229.  My common side effect is nausea and a little constipation. I would recommend this drug for anyone that trying to eat healthy, exercise and lose weight to get back on track. I was on dosage 3.0 for a week and had to drop back down to 2.4 because I was so nauseated. It does decrease your appetite but you still need to eat and make sure you drink plenty of water.  I don&#039;t like the fact when you injected the medicine in your upper thigh is leaves a bruise, never have a mark on my stomach. Good luck""",2
Abilify,Depression,"""For the past 20 years I have been on antidepressants, longest being Remeron. Along with the depression I have had periods of intense anxiety, unbelievably intense, to the extent that I could not stand to be here. In December of 2011 I was in the throws of anxiety and my psych doc suggested 2mg Abilify (in addition to the Remeron). My anxiety was GONE in a day and it has stayed GONE, My depression is gone as well, My pharmacist has told me that others have had a similar experience and are as amazed as I am. I can&#039;t say enough about this medicine, amazing, just amazing.""",5
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I am a 53 year old Mom with an 11 year old daughter. I suffer with lower back pain from L4 disc surgery in Sept &#039;16 and fibromyalgia. Advil just does not touch the pain and it also triggers acid reflux. Hydrodone made me severely nauseous. 
Oxycodone is the ONLY pain medicine that gives me relief. It does not make me sleepy or cause acid reflux. I DO take a stool softener on an every other day basis to prevent constipation &amp; that works. Previously I had been on it for 2 years prior to surgery for sciatic nerve pain. After surgery I had NO problem weaning off. If you wean slowly, 1/2 pill reduction at a time, it&#039;s not an issue. It has been a lifesaver for me.""",9
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My 8 y.o. was prescribed this medication to help with her aggression and hyperactivity. It did not help her, at all. I feel she had actually gotten a little worse while taking it. She had a lot of trouble falling asleep.. she would wide awake at midnight, when 1am some nights. Besides the trouble sleeping issue, she only seemed to experience one other side effect, which was nausea, but only on the first night. I gave it one month and then told her Psychiatrist that it wasn&#039;t for her.""",1
Prozac,Depression,"""I&#039;m 16 and have been on Prozac for about 3 months and I must say that it&#039;s a great antidepressant. There are very few side effects for me including an upset stomach, feeling anxious, and few others which kept improving over time. This medicine really helped me to deal with my depression. Many symptoms like inability to maintain concentration, panic attack, losing control, brain fog, hopelessness, extreme negativism, fear of death improved within 2 weeks and kept improving onwards. I&#039;m still on it and I just love it and I think it can help anyone with depression. With the pace of time, Prozac really helped me stay positive about everything. Sometimes I feel like I have already overcome my depression. It&#039;s really helpful.""",5
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""On week 2 of saxenda. I am down 5 pounds. No real side effects, other than starting to get a mild headache, which I struggled with before the drug. I am not a person who eats out of hunger, but rather out of boredom, so I was a little skeptical. I can honestly say, wow.. I am not ever really thinking about food. When I do have a snack, it is about a 10th of what I use to eat. So we will see how this goes. Good luck on our journey""",2
Alprazolam,Depression,"""I have taken Xanax for many years at a safe daily dose. I started in 2004 with 0.25 mg three times daily,  having severe anxiety attacks while my dad was losing his battle with cancer.  As the years progressed and I realized I have a big social anxiety issue, I stayed on Xanax. I couldn&#039;t function socially without it. Last year I was diagnosed with menieres disease which causes daily vertigo spells and constant roaring in my ear. My doctor increased my Xanax to .5 mg three times daily, as it helps with these symptoms.  Not long ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression.   I was put on Celexa but am hating the side effects. I took myself off Zoloft twice in the past because of the side effects.  Xanax has truly been a life saver for me""",5
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I took 10mg Belsomra for a few days and quit because it made me feel drugged and very sensitive to light. Besides that it never worked to make me fall asleep.

Also, after about 20 minutes of taking it I got a panic sensation and increased heart rate that lasted about 1-2 minutes.

Belsomra is a joke. 

I went back to Ambien. At least it works and it doesn&#039;t give me side effects.""",0
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I just recently started on vyvanse, and it works very well! So I&#039;m 21, and in the past I&#039;ve been on adderall, Ritalin and strattera. But none work as good as vyvanse. Adderall worked but left me feeling jittery, and Ritalin when it wore off I became angry. And strattera that&#039;s a whole nother story! But the main thing I like about vyvanse is I still am me. I don&#039;t feel jittery or like a robot. I&#039;m me just with everything at a more calm controlled manner. The only downfalls are that it takes 2 hours to start working and only last 6-7 hours when I was told it would be 14 hours. But other than that it gets 2 thumbs up and 5 gold stars!""",1
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""This med is amazing. 23 year old christian college grad with every type of anxiety for the past 2 years. Could barely go to class or the grocery store, felt dissociated, distant and terrified of people (including friends). Was scared to try any drug but after losing my job and needing to go out and interview I decided to try something. 3 days in and I feel totally changed. No anxiety. Clear head. Feel like I could even move countries to work and I&#039;ve been out more in a weekend than I have been in 3 months combined. I take 5mg and 25mg of hydroxyzine to balance out the side effects (blurry vision, headaches, muscle spasms etc). Don&#039;t be scared just try it. I regret not going on this sooner.""",7
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Worst time with this medication. Nightmares, sleep walking, severe headaches, vomiting, didn&#039;t help me sleep at all, I would wake up and sleep walk into different rooms knowing I was sleep walking but so disoriented I had no idea where I was.  On night I walked to a storage building and stripped and fell breaking my arm. I was there until the next morning because I couldn&#039;t get up and didn&#039;t have a cell phone. My father had tried calling but with no answer he finally drove up and eventually found me... I hated the hangover effect.... I hope others benefit from it.""",0
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I began taking Concerta at the age of 13 to treat my ADHD. I&#039;m now 22, still taking 27MG of Concerta daily. Overall it has been helpful with managing my ADHD symptoms, I&#039;m much less distracted and able to stick to one task at a time. It was especially helpful when I was in school because it was just so impossible for me to stay focused in class. As an adult it makes work so much easier for me because my job requires things to be done with a lot of precision. Side effects I&#039;ve experienced have been headaches (occasionally migraines), inconsistent appetite, restlessness at night, some difficulty sleeping and constant thirst. Despite the side effects I feel that my overall quality of life has improved with taking Concerta to manage my ADHD.""",1
Paxil,Depression,"""I thought I needed an antidepressant, so I tried a couple. Paxil for me had terrible side effects. I felt like I was on speed.  Had to eat every two hours. I could not go anywhere; always had to have snacks with me and I lost weight even with the calorie increase.  Insomnia was the worst.  I could not even take 10 mg.  I tried the medication for about 7 weeks and decided it was not for me and began a weaning off process.  Reduced to 5 mg for 1 week, this was the hardest and caused the most side effects which included vertigo, nausea and insomnia which lasted about 2 days.  Then I reduced to 2.5 mg for another week and a half.  Stopped taking it completely after this and did fine with no side effects.""",5
Zoloft,Depression,"""This is my second time on Zoloft.  The first time it was recommended and prescribed by my physician for Hep C treatment.  I had CRAZY side effects but back then I could not distinguish which medicine was causing this. I could not eat, trembling, sweats, etc.  Two years later and Hep C cleared (ya-hoo) I found myself anxious and severely depressed.  I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg and I have been taking it for two days.  I have lost two pounds cannot eat, sleep and my head feels likes it going to explode with worry and pressure.  I called my doctor but of course he was not in, so I got a professional opinion from a friend who told me to stick it out that the symptoms would subside.  """,5
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""This medicine absolutely almost ruined my life, to the point I was going to lose EVERYTHING.  It made me nauseous,  tired,  loss of sex drive , made me want to drink 24/7 all because I DIDN&#039;T CARE ANYMORE!  I lost 2 jobs, because I had no desire to function basically.  I have been off it for 2 weeks now now and the side effects from coming off this medication is not bad at all.  I feel happy again,  a little anxiety but omg I&#039;ll deal with it the natural way. ...exercise or just enjoy my family again.  """,7
Cymbalta,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had Frozen Shoulder for 8 months.  If you aren&#039;t familiar with frozen shoulder, it is not only inconvenient because of the inability to move your arm, it is terribly painful.  It takes usually about 12 to 24 months to get over it, and I&#039;ve been on Vicodin, Tramodol, Advil and other pain killers for this, while doing physical therapy.  I also have a topical prescription compound for my pain.  I was at my wit&#039;s end when my doctor came up with the idea of Cymbalta.  It seems to have been a great idea.  I have a little dry mouth, but I am about 80 percent pain free.  I still can&#039;t &#039;Move&#039; my arm, but with physical therapy, that will come in time.  It used to hurt (REALLY HURT) 24/7!""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started Adipex on January 15, 2013. I am 24 years old  5&#039;5 and my weight during that time was 259lbs sadly. Today it is April 23, 2013 and I have lost 38lbs! I have tried many other diet pills but never had any luck. I have tried to exercise and watch calories without the help of diet pills but it just wasn&#039;t working for me. Yes, there were side effects high blood pressure/high heart rate (WATCH FOR IRREGULAR HEART BEAT), If so call the doctor that gave medicine. As long as I drank a lot of water the side effects decreased and was tolerable. I would recommend this to anyone who has a hard time sticking to diet and exercise. This pill has worked great for me. Drink only water, get rid of sugar. Walk at least on mile a day.""",3
Mirena,Birth Control,"""One of the worst things I&#039;ve ever done! Was excited to get it as no longer had to worry about contraception but I was wrong. I had it inserted in October which was not very painful. Felt OK then in the middle of November started bleeding constantly. Checked with the dr and she said it would ease, I bled all the way through to mid February when I finally got it taken out. I was so depressed. So was really happy I had it removed and thought it was over until I started getting the most severe pain and ended up in emergency with an infection. I ended up on 3 courses of antibiotics. It&#039;s now the following November and am only just feeling like my normal self.""",8
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I honestly have not had too many problems with this. I have had it for almost 5 months now and at  first I did get migranes and gained about 20 lbs but after about 2 months the headaches went away and I am just now getting my period for the first time since starting this birth control. It is lasting over 2 weeks though. So I guess the most helpful thing I can say is a majority of the side effects will be temporary and are usually just your body adjusting and that it is a very effective form of birthcontrol! Don&#039;t let certain reviews scare you because everyone has a different experience!""",8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""At the age of 30, I still dealt with breakouts. After trying all sorts of over the counter products that just hurt me I went to the doctor. We took the steps of prescription washes and antibiotics. Still had breakouts. So decided to try Accutane. I&#039;m currently starting my 5th month, and I haven&#039;t had a breakout or a single pimple in over 3 months. My side effects were dry peeling lips ( nothing Carmex can&#039;t fix), dry eyes, very sensitive skin (though working in a hospital doesn&#039;t help) so far I am so satisfied with this medicine. Yes, it is a hassle to get but worth it.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""After a bad break up &amp; a hard time at work, put on 40 pounds over 7 months but then I went from 314# to 219# over 2 years. Then things got crazy again and I went from 219 to 259 on 2/17/17 when I got weighed at the dr&#039;s office. He knew how hard I worked to drop those original 96 pounds &amp; wanted to get me back on track. Started Phentermine 37.5 on 2/20, it has been 5 days &amp; I&#039;m down 8.6 pounds. Suppresses my appetite, don&#039;t want to snack or crave junk food. I have to literally make myself eat -- unfamiliar territory after my gluttony these last 7 months! Drinking 128 oz  of water a day. Meals are lean &amp; around 800 calories. Side effects: Insomnia &amp; mild constipation. Hoping it continues this way -- would love to drop 30 pounds at my 1 month mark!""",3
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I have been on Belviq for just shy of 10 months. I started at about 288 lbs. I got an Eat Smart scale the second week on Belviq. I was a 54 year old male. Today, I weighed in at 226 lbs. That is 62 lbs. lost in almost 10 months. The week I started, my A1c was 6.6. My PCP has been having blood work done every 3 months. My A1c is now 5.3 and I am no longer taking Metformin or Simvistatin. Side effects are very minor, compared to how it has changed my life. And the second best thing is, I sleep much sounder. If I do wake up at night, I fall back asleep right away. When I make it to my goal weight, I will probably talk to my doctor about continuing Belviq at a 1/2 dosage.""",2
Topamax,Obesity,"""This is an early review as I just started it on 10/16/16 but the food cravings are gone, it takes less food to satisfy me, soda tastes terrible, cigarettes taste different and bad  (which is a surprising good side effect!) and I just feel better with less food in me. I have tried phentermine with no luck and usually had good success with natural weight loss until being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and needing a knee replacement that keeps me from working out too much. So so far, I am impressed. I&#039;ll be back in a few weeks for a weigh in review. No side effects like others have had with mental fogginess or tingling. 25mg 2x day. Here&#039;s hoping my 235 can become 155 again!""",2
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I&#039;m a 40yr old mother of 1, struggling with weight loss. In the beginning of the year, I entered a biggest loser challenge. From January to March I lost a total of 14lbs by diet and exercise. I started off and 214lbs and by march I was 200lbs. I did lots of cardio using a beachbody at home workout called &quot;Cize&quot; with Shaun T. Well I plateaud and got discouraged. I also started to go back to me old eating habits. Guess what I gained it all back by August. Weighing 213lbs
On August 29 I started phentermine 37.5. I take my pill at 5am and I&#039;m currently down 5lbs in one week. I also  do at least 45 min cardio, drinks lots of water and watch my calorie in take. The side affects have also subsided. I can sleep now""",2
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I tried this because hey, who doesn&#039;t love 5 year birth control that you basically forget about? It was absolutely awful. The insertion experience was excruciating for me. I passed out on the table and vomited. 
I gained 35lbs in 7 months despite counting calories/working out. I had extremely bad anxiety/depression, I would walk into a place and immediately start pouring sweat. I got terrible acne all along my jawline &amp; back. Extremely low sex drive &amp; I was so emotionless I felt like a robot. I was on the IUD for about 7 months then decided I couldn&#039;t handle these issues anymore. 
The removal was easy, I didn&#039;t even feel it. Since then I&#039;ve lost weight, acne cleared up, sweating went away, and I have emotions again. Would not recommend.""",8
Citalopram,Depression,"""Among other diagnosis, I have major depression, and for the past 25  years have been prescribed many antidepressants.  Previous to Citalopram, I took an antidepressant that began to positively affect my frame of mind.  However, after a month of use, and increased doses prescribed by the Dr., did not help.  With Citalopram, after one month of miraculous mood improvement, I suddenly got dropped back to where I felt a month ago.  I have yet to see the Physician to inform him.""",5
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""Having been diagnosed with primary chronic insomnia at the age of 13, I have spent my life dealing with the condition.  After serving for 20 years of active duty I found that my condition worsened as time went on.  Now, in my mid-40&rsquo;s, my condition has come to the point where, without medication, I can, and do, stay awake for 3-4 days on end without difficulty.  Using quetiapine in combination with another medication had turned out to be the only combination that gives me 6-8 hours of solid sleep.  I take 100mg along with my other med and within an hour I am tired enough to go to sleep.  I have had nights where the combination had no effect, but there have been only a dozen or so in the last 5 years""",0
Symbyax,Depression,"""This drug combination has literally saved my life 3 times. I suffer from comorbid spectrum anxiety disorders: OCD, Severe Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I also have Major Depression.

This combination worked so well, I took it for 3 years straight in my early 20&#039;s. Went back to school, got a job, felt like my old self.

The only drawback is the major weight gain, a mild tremor when waking, and some orthostatic hypotension. 

But if you take it easy, and watch your weight, you will feel better. I hope other people who feel hopeless see this, that is exactly how I felt. It is a great combination. Best of Luck!""",5
Benzaclin,Acne,"""This stuff works fantastically well.  I am a 30 year old female with adult onset acne. I have been struggling with cysts, nodules, and pustules for eight months, exclusively on my chin.  I was using a Retin-A 0.025% product but it wasn&#039;t enough.  I started taking Benzaclin around the same time as Yaz (birth control) and Minocycline (antibiotic) and the combination cleared me in a month.  The Benzaclin stands out in my regime because it single-handedly dried up all of my large pimples upon first use (I noticed a dramatic improvement the next day, and then every day after that).  It will take a bit for all the current pimples to heal themselves (and some may surface over the first two weeks) but you should notice improvements right away!""",4
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 15 year old girl and have been taking 18 mg in the morning for 4 days now and 0.1mg of clonidine at night. I had a mild, lingering headache the first day, was able to focus a little more on songs I was working on the 2nd day, lost emotion and had to fake laughing and smiling with my friend the next day, and today I was able to focus a little more than usual and get some vocabulary words done. I&#039;m more motivated, but my attention span isn&#039;t improved much. Also, I can sit still. My psychologist doesn&#039;t think I&#039;m hyperactive but my usual constantly-moving legs and fidgety hands are still.  I&#039;ll have to give it more time to work, and increase the dosage once my body is used to it, but I think it&#039;s doing okay for only 4 days on a low dose.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have always thought of trying out a weight loss pill, but the only option seemed to be accepting being jittery. My psychiatrist started me on Contrave and have been taking them for three months. I&#039;m down 40 lbs. I also noticed within the first two weeks that I didn&#039;t want to smoke cigarettes as much. It&#039;s actually listed in the safety info that contrave is also used for smoking cessation, so doctor said this made sense. I have had NO negative side effects, I love the Scale Down Program and couldn&#039;t say enough to outline all of the reasons I love this medication so much!!""",2
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I tried Ambien but the only thing it did was make me stumble through the house like a drunk but not sleep well at all. But from the first time I took Lunesta 3mg it gently put me to sleep and I sleep the best I have slept in a long time; and after 2-3 years it still works well. Plus I wake with no feeling like I even take something to sleep. I am finding the need to take it to get sleepy more now, so my tolerance for this may have increased but I still think its a wonder drug for me. I think different people need different medicines to help. I think I&#039;m lucky this works so well for me. Good luck everyone! I hope you find something that works just as well for you!""",0
Lithium,Depression,"""I have to say Lithium has change my life for the good. I started taking this med, just 5 days ago and it&#039;s like I got my life back. I have paranoid schizophrenia and major depression and borderline personality disorder. The past 8 years were literally like hell on earth for me. I&#039;ve tried so many different medication and nothing really worked for me. The first time I took my Lithium I felt like more in tuned on what&#039;s going on. Now I&#039;m on day 5 and my racing thoughts are pretty much gone. My depression is vanishing. My voice&#039;s are at a minimum. My anixiety from going out in public has been getting better and better. It actually boost&#039;s my confidence. My energy level has gone way up. I&#039;m generally more happier and more at peace.""",5
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve always had trouble falling asleep and making my brain &quot;turn off&quot; even if I am exhausted. I have used lots of OTC sleep medicines but they just weren&#039;t cutting it anymore with some added stress in my life currently. Finally broke down and went to doctor for sleeping pills. Was a little scared at first because even without any sleep aids when I do sleep I have been known to sleep walk/talk in sleep/etc.  Normally hard for me to fall asleep but once I&#039;m out I am out cold and don&#039;t wake up. Anyway. No need in worrying about the side effects for me because I did not get a wink of sleep the first night I took it. Tonight is night #2 and I took it at 9:30. It is now 1 am and still here wide awake. Useless.""",0
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Well I must admit I was skeptical when my doctor offered this Belviq. I have tried everything under the sun without much success. I figured the first 2 weeks are free so why not? I lost 7 lbs in 2 weeks which for me is great! No side effects like the other medicine I tried. I got my next prescription which I had to pay for. My doctor has to fill out some medical necessity form for my insurance to cover it. Looking forward to losing more weight. Again no side effects! Wow!""",3
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""Definitely improving my life. I&#039;m less stressed at work and life with the kids is easier.  Some social settings (crowds) still bothersome, but I&#039;m getting there. One of the pages I read warned about caffeine intake, they weren&#039;t kidding. I cut out caffeine and it lessened my mood swings.  Please read about interactions with other medicines when you start something new, it makes a difference!""",7
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I can&#039;t recommend this pill. It&#039;s only been two days and my IQ has gone way down, I promise it wasn&#039;t always this way... Anyway, within two days of taking this pill my mind became incredibly forgetful, I forgot my own phone number, and it took me 5 minutes to be able to recall it again. I made multiple big mistakes at work, mistakes that I&#039;ve never made in my whole 2 years there. I was mortified, but thankfully my boss was really nice about it.

Also, I gave a girlfriend a ride home and she told me I was driving awfully and it kind of scared her. Normally I&#039;m a very cautious driver, and she told me that she&#039;d never felt that way before with my driving.

I can&#039;t continue taking this pill because it destroys my good work performance.""",6
Nubain,Pain,"""I have chronic migraines and am on all types of medicine for them. Sometimes every month or so I get one that&#039;ll last a week. Yes a week. And I go to my primary doctor and he give me Nubain. It really is a wonderful drug for migraines I have been using it for three years now. It&#039;s completely non addicting. And it takes away my severe migraine in just 15 minutes . Weeks of pain gone after one shot .""",9
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Here&#039;s the thing iv always had painful very painful cramps. I would know for certain that I would not be able to do anything 1 day out of the month. I was just lay in bed in extreme pain. No meds would help my pain it was the worst thing ever. But then I got nexplanon. And omg I was so happy when I got it my cramps went away I had no pain i felt like the luckiest girl in the world. But then I got my period ... and weeks later I was still on my period.. then months.... then a year. Get my point ? I will be taking this out very soon. It sucks having to buy pads and tampons every day for years.. and being sexual active ? Haha yeah right. This help my cramps but bleeding for 3 years straight. I can&#039;t take it anymore""",8
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was diagnosed for OCD 20 years ago, went on zoloft, prozac, paxil and celexa, none of them worked in a long run. So I stop taking meds, but at times, I would get depress for no reason for weeks. I have constant thoughts running in my mind, mostly I am sad, and small things can make me angry, sensitive to sound(phone ringing, door bell, people talking). Now I was diagnosed as Bi polar,and was put on Lamictal 25mg and after 2 weeks increase to 50mg and than 75mg. Thoughts process was gone and was feeling happy. Anger and sensitivity to sound were still there.
        But 6 weeks on Lamictal, I had sore throat and than running nose, sneezing, flu type symptoms and than I notice rash on my chest, so I stop Lamictal. anyone with similar experi""",6
Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I started taking Pristiq about 5 weeks ago.  I was experiencing some nausea at first, but after about two weeks it faded.  About three weeks in I forgot to take the medicine for three days and completely plummetted into a dangerous pool of emotion.  I have been on one other medication, Celexa, and what I like what Pristiq is that I am still able to experience a wide range of emotions. When I was on Celexa I was a little bit numb to things and wasn&#039;t able to cry, at all.  With Prisiq I am more focused and I am happier.""",7
Belviq,Obesity,"""I am a woman in my 40s and I weighed 290 lbs. when I started taking Belviq in Sept. 2014. Now I weigh 206. I still have a ways to go. The weight loss was fast in the beginning, but now, it is slow, but steady, which my doctor says is the best way to lose weight because the faster you lose, the faster you regain it. Unlike most diet drugs, Belviq has no side effects whatsoever. It doesn&#039;t entirely suppress the appetite, but helps you eat sensibly. I&#039;ve heard others who take Belviq say that it works best for people who live alone and aren&#039;t tempted by what family members, who aren&#039;t on a diet, are eating. I highly recommend Belviq, but only for those who are committed to losing weight.""",2
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Parents putting there kids on this stuff, yikes, man I just feel bad for your poor child. You realize you&#039;re giving them pure amphetamine right? I would avoid taking amphetamines until your brain has finished developing. Age 21-25. It&#039;s just absurd that something like Vyanse is prescribed to children. That said, for adults, this stuff is wondrous. Has changed my life. I&#039;ve been taking 60mg Vyvanse for 3yrs straight with zero issues. Zero break.  Zero tolerance. I&#039;m 32. Male. I&#039;ve literally tried it all (Dex, Desoxyn, Addie, Provigil) &amp; nothing comes close Vyvanse! If you truly have ADHD as an adult, this drug will alter your life in such a positive way! Adults only though!!! Common parents, you&#039;re totally screwing your kids over.""",1
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have used Ambien for 6 years. It worked very well all the time before they introduced the generic brands. The generics are NOT the same as the original and do not produce the same results. They leave me hung over and each manufacturer has his own brew thus are unpredictable in how they will perform. I have offered to pay the difference to get the real Ambien but with no success. Sure wish this wasn&#039;t so expensive.""",0
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I have not had a good nights sleep for over a year. Woken up several times a night. I have been miserable due to lack of sleep. It is really starting to show on my face - deep dark under-eye circles. Yesterday, my doctor prescribed Lunesta. I slept so good last night. Only woke up twice, but went right back to sleep. I do not feel any grogginess. There is a &quot;yucky&quot; taste side effect. But, I will take yucky taste any day for a good nights sleep. I am really excited to get a good nights sleep again tonight. Hope it works the same again.""",0
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have a friend who had taken ambien for years without any problems. For whatever reason he had an episode where he took his pill and then remembers nothing until he was at the police station. He had drank three beers (which he only knows because that&#039;s all that was in his frig) then proceded to drive (!!) and ended up crashing into another parked car. This is scarey stuff, eh? It works wonderfully, but I surely wouldn&#039;t want to have a blackout and end up driving. Is there any class action suit against this drug? I&#039;ve heard of the other stories -- walking naked in the winter cold, eating while sleeping, and then my friend&#039;s experience.""",0
Vicodin,Pain,"""Diagnosed with Carpel Tunnel Syndrome, my physician prescribed two Vicodin a day for pain relief.  For the first couple of days I was drowsy after the noon tablet but now my body seems to have acclimated itself to the drug and I&#039;m no longer drowsy, and I&#039;m reasonably pain free.  It isn&#039;t perfect, but I gave it an eight out of a possible ten!  I don&#039;t expect to be on it long enough to worry about addiction.""",9
Celexa,Depression,"""I have suffered from depression off and on for years and have taken Zoloft in the past. This time it didn&#039;t seem to be working. I also was hit with overwhelming anxiety because of my husband&#039;s job difficulties. The doctor prescribed Celexa a couple of months ago. After 3 weeks, I was ready to give up on this because it took longer to kick in than Zoloft. I also had terrible dry mouth and food just didn&#039;t taste good. But the Doctor bumped me up to 60 mg and that really did the trick. I only have dry mouth when I first wake up in the morning and food tastes good again. My hubby said that on Zoloft I was more &quot;flat emotioned&quot; but on the Celexa, I have the normal ups and downs that everyone else has. The only negative is that I am on the tired side, but not terribly bad. It is a lot better than wanting to jump in front of a bus. I urge everyone to give this a try and stick with it. Good luck!""",5
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 46 and recently diagnosed with ADHD.  Straterra is the first and only medication I&#039;ve tried for this condition.  I&#039;ve been on it for 2 weeks and notice profound improvements in my ability to concentrate, absorb material, and complete tasks.  That is what I had hoped to achieve with Straterra.  However, I am experiencing some unpleasant side effects, including difficulty urinating (very slow flow and the sensation that I&#039;m not finished after my bladder is empty) and &quot;frothy&quot; ejaculations during sex that occur without any sensation of orgasm.  For now, I can accept the trade off, as I am much more productive at work.  But I&#039;m really hoping these side effects disappear or diminish.""",1
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I am back on this birth control after not being on anything for a few years but my periods were becoming such a nuisance with my busy schedule (9 days of heavy bleeding and clots). Due to my migraines with aura I can&#039;t take anything with estrogen in it. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m an anomaly or why there are such terrible reviews as I no longer have periods at all. It completely stopped my cycle but I have to make sure to take it at exactly the same time each day. I still feel like myself - without the mood swings or crying. I am slightly more fatigued at night and fall asleep earlier which might be a good thing. My vaginal discharge is thicker. I&#039;ve actually noticed my acne improving and haven&#039;t noticed any weight changes.""",8
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I had been on Strattera for 8 years. It did great but within last year things seemed to change. I thought it wasn&#039;t working due to my memory and concentration but now being off for about a month realize it was doing a lot. I am now having headaches lack of motivation loosing temper easily etc. My family and friends see a significant change in my behavior. (Negative change). Concentration and focus have always been an issue on and off medicine so I just have to work harder with it. Also realize it takes more than this medicine to really have success.""",1
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve tried several different sleep medications for insomnia and while attempting to get used to the CPAP machine for sleep apnea. Ambien CR works great, I can get a full nights sleep, however go to bed within 1 hour of taking the medication or you will feel a bit drugged. I don&#039;t recommend taking every night, it is addictive (try not to take more than 3 nights in a row). It is more difficult to wean off from than regular Ambien. Overall, if needed this is a good medication if taken responsibly.""",0
Pregabalin,Pain,"""I have just started on this medication, it is hard to say if it is working for me yet. I do notice the dry mouth and yucky aftertaste. I have been dealing with an unknown condition for many years nobody can figure out what is wrong. I have been sleeping a bit better since I have been on Lyrica. I am also on about 14 other medications so not sure which one is doing what haha. It does help to see so many people. Have heard such great reviews of this treatment. It is hopeful for me to look for in the future.""",9
Adderall,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in the first grade and was put on many different ADHD medicines like Ritalin and Cycler to name a few and had bad experiences with both so in the 5th grade I took myself off of them and my grade dropped to d&#039;s &amp; f&#039;s and I dropped out in 9th grade. Recentley I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was put on Depakote and Seroquel recently my doctor wanted to try me on Adderall and it has worked wonders for me. It has helped me stay focused and am able to sit still and it has helped with my bipolar disorder and I am no longer tired all day to to my pain management medicines. I highly recommend this medicine for anyone with ADHD and bipolar disorder. The only side effect is teeth grinding. Awesome medicine.""",1
Aczone,Acne,"""I have dealt with acne off and on my entire adult life.  Finally became fed up with the constant bumps and dark spots, I visit a dermatologist. I was asked to try the Aczone (Dapsone) along with Doryx and at first it seemed to work, but now it does nothing for me. I would rather try something less expensive that will be effective versus something that cost a lot without insurance. Sorry but Aczone is not for me.""",4
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I have been on Cymbalta for almost 5 years after a very difficult 4 years of PND/PSTD. Other medications got me to a point of about 50 percent improvement. This was far from ideal/adequate. Cymbalta worked for me like no other antidepressant. My anxiety reduced to the point where I can function at a pretty high level. I still have bouts of anxiety and occasional dark moods but they pass and even now are fewer and further between. I have tried to come off of it a few times but at 30mg the cogs begin to turn faster and I can feel my anxiety levels significantly increasing. I am concerned that my emotions are a bit blunted and like someone else said, I cannot cry, which I miss. I used to like a good, therapeutic cry. I also have no sex drive.""",7
Morphine,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been on Kadian for 8 months (car accident 3 years ago, suffering from extensive postural and disc and recently diagnosed PTVS symptoms since). I&#039;m 22 and started feeling able to live my life again after taking Kadian (10mg 2 x day) and it seemed to make my mood better. It no longer works at current dose and doctor won&#039;t move up a dose, and doesn&#039;t believe in short-acting medicines. First 6 months it really did wonders and gave me a lot of my life back. Constipation is brutal with this medicine - I take Miralax daily with some relief. Withdrawals are horrific.""",9
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""This November 2015 I will have had implanon for 3 years. The only thing I guess I could say that was bad was that I had a period for maybe most 2 weeks after a year of having it. After that I haven&#039;t had any period since. I get cramps rarely, no spotting. Very effective against pregnancy, very effective for stopping implantation if anyone was wondering because I know I was when I got it. I plan to get implanon again when it&#039;s time to remove it. I think I&#039;ve had an overall positive experience and I hope the second time around is good as well!""",8
Strattera,ADHD,"""Strattera is a wonderful ADHD medication if you know how it works for you. For me it takes a solid 8 weeks before the full effect of the Medication kicks in to full potential. When it does. I have a superb memory through paying attention. My Dr. Increased it from 40mg when it worked well but not well enough. To 80mg. Then I had to restart the 8 weeks. Like the 40mg,  I started noticing a difference in 5 weeks. After 6th week it&#039;s a perfect mix. Superb focus that seems to get better week after week. I&#039;m glad I gave the Statterra a chance.""",1
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""This drug literally saved my life. Before I started taking it, there was no quality of life left. I would get so nervous around people I couldn&#039;t go out into public at all, had severe panic attacks all of the time... I&#039;ve dealt with this my entire life, and it took me 17 years being put on every anti depressant/mood stabilizer/even anti psych meds except anti anxiety meds (because doctors are too afraid to prescribe them...we have a lot of junkies here) I finally found a doctor who understands me. I take 1mg xanax 3 times a day and 1,200 mg of lithium a day. This medication has changed my life. I no longer struggle with my life, I feel like for the first time I have total control and it feels great.""",7
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""It seems to be helping, but still some depression remains.  I have Bipolar Type 1, so I have struggled with mania, hypomania, mixed mood, and depression.  I do notice I&#039;m more &quot;even,&quot; which is what the medicine intends to do.  I take a combination of meds, so it could be difficult to tell which medicine is doing what.  All I know is that I have no side effects, which is good, because I requested a mood stabilizer that will not make me gain weight.  Overall, I&#039;m satisfied with the way things are going (thank goodness, because Bipolar could be hell).""",6
Paroxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve just started on paxil. Doctor said take in morning but I&#039;ve been horribly groggy and depressed. So I switched to taking it at night and there&#039;s an amazing difference! I&#039;m energetic and I feel good this far. I can organize My thoughts and anxiety seems to be down abit but like I said just the begenning.

Weight loss- paxil curbs my appetite!! It&#039;s great because I need to lose a lot of weight. I&#039;ve lost about 6 pounds so far but I am also dieting, exercising, and actively trying to lose weight the appetite suppressant affect just help me a lot!""",5
Zoloft,Depression,"""I&#039;ve always experienced social anxiety growing up. I thought this was normal but it became clear to me during college that I shouldn&#039;t be feeling so shy all the time. I was afraid to be myself. I was constantly going back and forth between anxiety and depression for years. I tried meditation, yoga, running, a different diet... But nothing seemed to be working good enough! Enough was enough! I researched zoloft for a few weeks and finally decided to try it out. WOAH! Other than the initial side effects such as decreased appetite and restlessness, this medication changed my life!!! I feel very comfortable talking to people in social settings.. I could finally be myself! The biggest thing is being patient--- it works!!!!! Good luck everyone!""",5
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m taking Geodon 20 mg in the morning and evening now. The first night was AMAZING, it was the prime of my existence. I felt so calm and present and able to think of one thing at a time. I requested to take it in the morning too. The second day I got an anxiety attack in the middle of the day and I&#039;d never had one previously so I didn&#039;t know what to do with myself. The next few days the restlessness got better until it was gone. I thought it was over but today I got a weird feeling of uncoordination and discomfort, I couldn&#039;t write either. But every time I get a strange side effect, I nap it off. Seems to work. After napping, I&#039;m golden. Tomorrow will be my first completed week of Geodon.""",6
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""For years, I have had L1-L2 pain from a compression fracture and moderate disc degeneration. The pain relief from this is so much better than anything else I have taken, and I can go about my normal life without feeling drugged up like Oxycontin or other narcotic pain killers.  Not 100% relief yet though.  I&#039;ve only had it for a few weeks and my doctor and I are still working to find the right dosage.  I&#039;m on 15mg every 8 hours at the moment and will probably move up to 20mg soon.  It&#039;s very promising though.""",9
Seroquel,Depression,"""In October 2010 I had a psychotic attack.  It appears that my old medicine escitalopram (taken since 2004) has failed to treat my ongoing depressions. Since have transferred onto this medicine about six months ago by a psychiatrist. Taken with escitalopram I gained 1.5 stones in weight. No longer taking escitalopram the weight has dropped off of me. Now taking a dosage of 200 mg daily this medicine is not working on either the hallucinations or the depression. May need a stronger dosage and/or take in combination with an antidepressant.""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 18 year old college freshman and started taking Vyvanse 10 months ago when I had finally gotten medicated for my severe ADD.  It has significantly changed my life for the better. For as long as I can remember, my teachers always told my parents that I was very bright but I just would not &quot;apply&quot; myself but after taking Vyvanse my grades have skyrocketed. I can finally pay attention in class and actually absorb the information. I feel energized, motivated, and more organized to do things.  My days will be filled with productivity and I feel like it boosts my mood in general. My side effects include a slight anxiety because I feel like I should ALWAYS be doing something productive so sometimes its hard for me to relax.""",1
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""When I first started taking this at 5mg twice daily (10mg daily total) for generalized anxiety disorder, I was an absolute zombie, especially in the morning after taking my first dose. I was dizzy and unable to think straight. I was useless and confused at work, making my anxiety worse. Once I cut down to 2.5mg at bedtime, it was perfect for me. The ability to sleep well helped me to make better food choice, exercise more, and think more clearly. If I had more severe anxiety that needed stronger management, I don&#039;t think this medicine would have been appropriate for me, but it was great for my situation. I discontinued use during pregnancy but plan to revisit it as an option once I finish breastfeeding.""",7
Viibryd,Depression,"""I had depressive episodes even as a teenager.  They seemed to get worse every third month.  I&#039;d been on every known medicine for twenty years without any help.  I took Valium for panic attacks several times a day every day for twenty years.  I&#039;ve been on Viibryd for five weeks and finally found help.  The only side effects have been diarrhea only in the morning the first few days and dry mouth.  I wake up feeling very good each day.  Thank you.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Today is only my second day on this medication, and so far I am very pleased! I only have 20lbs to lose, but was stuck and needed help getting there. I took my first 37.5 pill yesterday at 630 and had the most euphoric happy feeling! I was not jittery, just hyper. Not the sick feeling you get from caffeine. (I am not a caffeine user). I did experience some hot flashes, but only for an hour. I was very satisfied with a ViShake for breakfast and lunch. I ate a 1/2 cup of broccoli and 6oz of venison for dinner and was stuffed! I couldn&#039;t finish it! I did get the dry mouth they talk about, but as for the insomnia, it never  happened. I actually was tired and went to bed and slept my usual 7 hours! I will update in a few weeks! Love this pill!""",3
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I lost 46 pounds. I went from a size 20 to size 14 and then my dr put my on this.  I mentioned I had extreme irritability-like I have zero patience for any and everyone!  
My Dr. told me it wasn&#039;t relevant but after reading other reviews I know I&#039;m not alone. It hasn&#039;t helped me lose any weight.  It costs me $142 a month for hopes wishes and dreams.  This is crazy.  I don&#039;t like taking a drug for seizures when I have no problems with that.  I&#039;m seeking a second opinion and hoping I can get phentermine for 3 months and be done with this.  
It really is the worst feeling to be so angry and irritated and pissed off with everyone when I&#039;m the one doing this to myself all in the hopes to lose 20 more pounds.  Ugh!!!""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I took phentermine for a month and lost 28lbs. IN A MONTH!! Talk about killing your appetite. My family was getting worried because I never wanted to eat. I had to remind myself to eat at 6:00. I told them not to worry because this is what I wanted (to not sit around and think about food all day). People are talking calories this and work-out that, but on phentermine, you automatically exercise because you have this amazing amount of energy that just keeps you going and keeping your mind off of food. It works and I love it.""",3
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""My Saviour, Suffered severe anxiety panic attacks constantly for the last 4 wks heart racing trembling stomach, tried numerous meds citalapram, sertraline, prozac etc which all made my anxiety much worse. My dr prescribed 5mg twice daily of diazipam, morning &amp; night I take 2.5mg in the evening a quarter in the morning &amp; the other quarter in the afternoon so 5mg in all daily. It has instantly been a. lifesave and a wonder drug for me.  I don&#039;t plan on over doing it or staying on it for very long. but if anyone is suffering badly I would say there is no harm in giving it  a try. If you can -  the side effects from other meds I&#039;d tried was horrific &amp; with diazepam I&#039;ve had non.  I hope this helps""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""When I was put on Lisdexamfetamine within a month of first taking it everything has improved. Things I would not normally do. I did my daily tasks, showing interest in things,  my impulsiveness movement has slowed down,  my thoughts slowed down and I can sit down and talk to people and hold a conversation with people.  A big thing that this medication has is the fat ingredient so I am now 11 stone as I was previously 9 stone so a big improvement. Within a month in everything as a person so this medication is a big thing in my life and feel the doctor has made the correct choice. I would recommend it to anyone who ADHD like me and if they are on it you will see improvement like i have big time!.""",1
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I was on Diane 35 for seven yrs (15-23 my skin was amazing) What I didn&#039;t realize was that Diane Caused me to gain a lot of weight, I put it on almost immediately (age 15) and struggled with weight issues and an eating disorder. When I stopped Diane at 23 to have kids, I quickly lost about 15 lbs (5lbs of water) and my insane appetite as well.  After children I wanted to go back on Diane for nice skin. I promptly gained the weight, eating issues returned! So I quit and decided to try spiro. 25 mg once a day. My skin started clearing immediately but Within 3 weeks I had weight gain, aged 5 yrs, along with other horrible side effects! Since quitting for two days I feel myself again! I&#039;ll stick with Skin Ceuticals Acne Kit and zinc supplements!!""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am 39 and weigh 191 . I had a surprise &#039;its not really menopause - its a baby&#039; 7 months ago. I lost 20 out of the 25 lbs I gained being pregnant. Then in November I had a partial hysterectomy. And gained back what I had lost in 2 months. That sucked. So today I went to my primary care Dr and asked for adipex...most drs won&#039;t prescribe it but she agreed I needed to lose weight. I&#039;ve taken phentermine before in my 20s with great results. Wish me luck on losing! I&#039;ll update again in a week.""",3
Oxycodone,Pain,"""Oxycontin is the best drug I have ever had.  I suffer from a prolapsed disc L5/S1. I also have a lot of shoulder pain due to a work accident where I had a bad fall. My dosage for Oxycontin is 120mg twice a day.  I also take Panadeine Forte 200mg twice a day also Oxynorm 10mg 1-2 times per day for breakthrough pain.  I also wear a patch called Fentanyl Durgesic 75mgr. I also get injections every 2-3 months, I also take a lot of depression medication. Overall with this combination my pain is under control most days but some days I cannot even get up and I lose my balance a lot.  I have to rotate my movements regularly during the day and night I cannot sleep properly due to the pain.""",9
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""Other then feeling numb on geodon (partly I think my antidepressant too) I love it. I&#039;ve been on geodon for a little over a year. Honestly I&#039;ll probably die taking this drug. It has saved me and brought me back to reality, after a mania-induced psychosis a year and a half ago. I&#039;m almost never paranoid anymore, I can function in my day to day life, I am stable. I&#039;ve even been able to cut down dramatically on how much I take.""",6
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Can&#039;t adequately give enough praise to Belviq.  My friend said try it there&#039;s a free coupon.  Other stories said it doesn&#039;t work, don&#039;t bother.  Lowered my expectations. Used it for two weeks, lost ten pounds and quit smoking.  Good grief!  What?  Used to smoke 2-packs a day for 25 years. Tried other smoking medications but felt like hell so quit those but not smoking.  Belviq and phentermine makes me feel 20 again. I drink more water. It&#039;s over a year later.  Without Belviq?  I&#039;d still be smoking and suffering through weird food diets. I do anything I want and enjoy life all day long with this, every day. No willpower needed. Don&#039;t get hungry, don&#039;t miss smokes, and no exercise necessary.  Haha.  Miracle. Grateful.""",3
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I like Abilify a lot because I used to be extremely irritable. I also couldn&#039;t ride my bicycle when I was manic because I would not focus on my safety. Luckily, I now only get hypomanic episodes thanks to Abilify. I feel like I am free to get off of my emotional roller coaster and explore the world outside. The only few problems it gave me were akasthesia and weight gain. I&#039;m 14 years old, and I don&#039;t know whether I gained 40 lbs from growing, the medicine, or both.""",6
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I entered the beginning stages of menopause and my mood changed dramatically.  I was getting very concerned as I had never felt so sad and hopeless.  I could not stop crying and things that  normally I would not let bother me were becoming huge issues.  I did not recognize myself.  I am known as glass half full kind of person so the change was dramatic.  I was put on 35mg of Effexor and wow - what a difference.  Surprise, surprise my hot flashes stopped, ( I have since read it helps with that)  mood back to normal and strangely my joints don&#039;t hurt so much and I have more energy.  The few negatives are I yawn a lot and though I still enjoy sex I can not have an orgasm.  I consider both minor due to feeling so much better.""",5
Buprenorphine,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been on narcotic pain relievers for 10 years. I have a connective tissue disease causing major joint pain, herniated discs l4- s1, collapsing deteriorating discs. I have bone on bone contact left knee. Torn miniscus. Osteoarthritis both knees. Bursitis both hips. Sciatica. Neuropathy. I have always been on ms-contin for 12 hr relief with assistance of dilauded or oxycodone. After transitioning of those meds I was put on 20mg of suboxone. My new Dr put me on 10mc/h butrans patch. It does nothing for my pain I had to double up to 20mc/h. It mildly helped. But I have a very high tolerance. I also do not like the sticky residue it leaves on my skin. Buprenorphine. Is used to detox drug addicts.  Not effective for people in severe pain.""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I just took my first pill, literally 5 minutes ago.  I have to say I&#039;m terrified of the side effects, but at 56 years only 5&#039;1 and 230 pounds, I&#039;m at my wits end with my weight.  I hope to be able to report back that I&#039;ve had no side effects and that it&#039;s working.  Reading all the reviews has helped.  Fingers crossed it works!

So after one week, I&#039;m done.  I can&#039;t take the jittery feeling, almost fell at work yesterday, I was walking like I was drunk.  Trying to get a normal sentence out was difficult, my mind was just not right.  I lost 3 pounds but I don&#039;t think it was the contrave that did it.  No other side effects though, just feeling like I was higher than a kite  :(""",2
Bupropion,Depression,"""Pros: 

- 14 days on it and haven&#039;t THOUGHT about eating(lost 29 pounds). 
- haven&#039;t thought of smoking a cig. 
- I&#039;m suddenly outgoing and happy. 

The Cons: 

- have not slept more than 3 hours for 14 days. 
- I am severely on edge from day 9-14. Had a panic attack going to work and yesterday was foaming at the mouth in a road rage incident where I became almost homicidal. 

For a minute, I thought I found a miracle, but I realized today that I can&#039;t handle this extra anxiety. Supposedly it goes away after a few weeks, but I don&#039;t think I can handle a few more weeks of this.""",5
Ativan,Anxiety,"""I have been on ativan for 15 years%u2026 started at 1mg and was gradually increased to 4mg. The medication only numbs things the anxiety never went away, and after I started taking I started getting other symptoms like OCD, social anxiety, depression and others 

I should never have trusted the Dr and should have researched the drug before taking. I will never again just take anything without researching it. I am slowly tapering it off, the withdrawals are a nightmare but staying on this medication which should be banned is not an option. This medication was never intended to be prescribed longer then a few weeks. Drs and drugstores are completely to blame right beside the drug companies. They all know it%u2019s poison.""",7
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""Overall, I would rate 7.5mg of Mirtazapine two hours before bed as an awesome remedy for severe to extreme Insomnia, with little to no side effects.

I had tried all kinds of sleep aids ranging from ambien to benzodiapines, with no effects. I am non to limited responder to Ativan and other benzos.

Mirtazapine works great for me, I get 7-9hrs of sleep, but only when I use the 7.5mg orally disintegrating tablets from Aurobindo. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT use the regular tablets. They had very limited effect on me. 

Mirtazapine will cause some drowsiness if I do not get the full 9 hours of rest, or have to get up early. This is easily mitigated by vitamin b12/C powder. 

Mirtazapine sleep feels natural and refreshing.""",0
Wellbutrin SR,Depression,"""I have been on 150mg of Welbutrin SR for a little over 2 years. If I could go back and do it over again I never would have started taking it in the first place. It wasn&#039;t until I was taking the medication for about 4 months that I really started noticing hair loss. It slowly started to get worse. On top of that I noticed ringing in my ears. The first few months were great, I had more energy energy, I lost weight, and I felt great. I have been trying to wean myself off of Welbutrin, however it&#039;s been extremely difficult because of the horrible withdrawal symptoms. Even tapering off a little has been extremely difficult. I wish I would have done more research on the side effects and possible withdrawal symptoms.""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""Yesterday, my dental hygienist asked me how I got my skin so clear. I almost cried because no one has ever complimented me on my skin before. My skin was the source of a great deal of unhappiness, anxiety, and stress in my life prior to Accutane. Thank you, Accutane, for giving me back my confidence and life.

As for side effects: very minimal. No changes in mood. Biggest pain in the butt was iPledge and monthly tests. I&#039;m a very busy person, so finding the time to run out of work in the middle of the day was difficult. But so worth it. Don&#039;t focus on all the negative stories!! I wish I would have ignored the naysayers and gone on this drug years ago! Good luck :)""",4
Nucynta,Pain,"""My Pain mgt. doctor switched me from Demerol to Nucynta for break-through pain of chronic migraines.  Surprisingly, I found it to be effective, but I noticed from the start that it greatly diminished my language skills:  reading, writing, and speaking.  As per doctor&#039;s orders I stayed in bed while under the effects of Nucynta so this weird side effect didn&#039;t cause me any issues.
     Until...After using it for 15 months, I found my language skills to be extremely loopy, creating comments from friends and neighbors, DAYS after taking Nucynta. That scared me and my doctor immediately took me off this medicine when I finally advised her of the language problem it presented.  I could be reading a sentence and forget a word&#039;s meaning.""",9
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I started having frequent panic attacks and anxiety spikes and my doctor suggested Lexapro. I had really bad nausea and lack of appetite the first week and had to force myself to eat to ease the hunger pains. After that subsided, I had a lot of muscle tension and soreness. It felt like my whole body was vibrating as if being electrically shocked. I was fidgeting all day, sitting in unusual postures, mistyping far more than usual, and knocking things over on my desk. After four weeks the panic attacks had stopped and my anxiety had improved slightly, but the muscular side-effects had me even more worried. I called my doctor and he switched me back to Sertraline. Tapering off Lexapro made the vibration and tension go away almost immediately.""",7
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been prescribed ability and loxapac for a manic episode on May 19th for slightly more than three weeks. It worked well but early June I started to feel unable to sit  still at some places. Around June 10th I had terrible anxiety and panic attacks, it was pure torture, so back to the institution. Had to wait two days until a doctor showed up , gave me something that stopped it all and removed the two drugs. It might be loxapac. Fact is, since then, there is another torture. Akathisia in the form of wanting to walk all the time. It&#039;s been one week now and thanks god it stops at night. I want to live (I&#039;m not even 20) 
I pray it stops fast  l&#039;ve suffered enough.
I really hate Abilify or Loxapac""",6
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I had nexplanon for almost 2 years after having my son. It was great from 18 months or so with no bleeding but noticed lack of sex drive, mood swings, and extreme exhaustion with no ability to sleep at night. I had it taken out weeks ago bc I bled 3 wks out of the month for a few months with horrible breast tenderness and cramps like never before. I still have all the symptoms but shirt periods frequently instead of long ones. I can&#039;t say I wouldn&#039;t recommend bc everyone is different but I&#039;m not ok with any extra hormones in my body anymore.""",8
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am a 23 year old female. My entire life I have tested highly, been in advanced classes, had a full scholarship through college, but my grades were always a struggle. I felt like I had to work so much harder than everyone else just to keep my B grades. I was disorganized, forgetful, irritable, and pretty desolate. I felt like I was drowning.
I have taken medication for depression and anxiety since I was in high school - everything from Wellbutrin, to Xanax, to Prozac. I graduated from college in four years with a mediocre GPA, but with many awards. Finally my new doctor actually listened when I spoke, and she agreed that we try a course of medication for ADHD. I am on my second week of Vyvanse and am a new, happy, functioning person.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I am a 6&#039;3&quot;, 37 year old white male (not sure what risk factors that lands me higher in, but it seems certain portions of the population are more prone to certain issues than others). Diabetes, heart Disease run in the family and I have asthma and a shot lower back.  Recipe for obesity. Long story short. 2.5 months ago I was 322lbs. 2 weeks ago, I was 284 lbs. Shoot hoops once a week, and stick to 1800 calorie a day diet.  Beyond that, no special &quot;restrictions&quot;.  Oatmeal for breakfast, chicken/tossed green salad for lunch and whatever fits under my remaining carb window for dinner.  Only complaint is Ohio only allows 3 months of use.  No side effects after week 1.""",3
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I wanted to update about my medication.  I am now 20 mg.  of Ritalin twice daily and 50 mg.  of Zoloft generic once daily.  Having suffered bipolar depression, PTSD, ADD/ADHD throughout different periods throughout my life.  I also Borderline/Mild General Learning Disability a labeling in terms that is least offensive to Mild Mental Retardation or Borderline/Mild Intellectual Disability.  In my case the GLD is extremely least severe in slightest degree.  Ritalin actually works very well for me while Zoloft treats the anxiety, depression, and some mild obsessive compulsive behavioral thoughts but nothing extreme severe or seriousness.  In some people depending DNA, generics how medication effects the individual might be very different, etc.""",1
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Ive been on nexplanon for about 7 months now after being on the depo shot for 4 years. The application of the nexplanon was easy and fairly painless. The biggest issue I have with nexplanon is the bleeding I&#039;ve been having for 6 out of the 7 months on this. And I&#039;m not talking spotting, I mean bleeding moderately heavy everyday for 6 months. Finally after I couldn&#039;t take it anymore I went to my doctor and she gave me a second birth control, the patch in hopes of stopping the bleeding from the extra estrogen and it worked!!! Ive been using the patch for a month now and I havent bled at all. I will probably stay on this for a while and eventually go back to the shot.""",8
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I have been on Phentermine for 66 days, take 37.5 mg/day, and lost 10 lbs. However as of tomorrow I will stop taking it. It has caused a very negative change in my thoughts &amp; personality &amp; causes huge mood swings. After being on it for 2 weeks I started noticing I was super sensitive, however blamed it on PMS at the time. It hasn&#039;t gotten better though. I have been irritable, angry, restless, &amp; just general feelings of sadness. The past couple days I also have been noticing &quot;flashes&quot; of something dark on the floor out of the corner of my eye but when I look in that direction nothing is there. When I read these are rare side effects I decided I need to stop taking it.""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I wrote a review before when I was a couple weeks into taking phentermine. I am 5&#039;4&quot; and I started on May 1st, 2016 weighing in athe 236 pounds. I was postpartum 1 year after my second child. Today is July 10th, 2016 and I weigh 200 pounds and still losing by the day! I&#039;ve noticed lots of changes I&#039;m going to share with you all. For starters, I did experience the dry mouth side effect for the first month. I also experienced lots of energy which was a huge thing for me. Now that I&#039;m about 2 1/2 months in and the energy really subsided. Also, in my second month there were days I would not take my medicine because I honestly just missed eating. I also noticed I could continue healthy choices w/o the med. I&#039;ll check back in!""",3
Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for about 6 months now, taking 50mg for about 6 weeks then bumping up to 100mg after that. I have noticed a huge change in mood. I don&#039;t fixate on little things and let them bother me for the whole day like they used too. I feel much more confident now and I am actually smiling lately. Some side effects I have noticed are the occasional headache (I find if I take it the same time each morning I don&#039;t get a headache), drymouth, and if I miss a dose I get absolutely WILD dreams and my anxiety comes creeping back in. Also, I notice it makes me ramble on and on when I talk sometimes which can be a little embarrassing especially in work situations. Overall though, the benefits significantly outweigh the side effects!!""",7
Quetiapine,Depression,"""First of all, for all the people writing reviews that haven&#039;t been on this drug for AT LEAST 4-6 WEEKS your reviews are almost invalid, this drug is as two-faced as many make it out to be and for those people they just aren&#039;t giving it enough time to see both sides of it. I have been on and off Seroquel for a few years now and currently taking 150mg at night for the past 3 months. It helped with anxiety and sleep which was great! I was less intimidated and anxious at school and with friends. However, it seriously affected my mood, constantly shifting from agitated to blunted, my concentration, my dreams, weight and eventually, over the course of about six weeks, caused one of the most serious relapses in my depression in years. Be careful!""",5
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for 2-3 months.  I had been taking 30 mg. a day, but my doctor told me I could try 60 mg.  a day, i.e. 30 mg. twice a day, and since I&#039;ve been taking 60 mg., which is about a month ago, something weird has happened: I feel ecstatic all the time, and as though I&#039;ve returned to my &quot;true&quot; self, i.e. ways I used to be, and liked, decades ago, but have been out of touch with for a long time. I&#039;m much more productive and creative, and don&#039;t feel overwhelmed the way I used to.""",7
Citalopram,Depression,"""I started using Celexa in 2005 following the death of my best friend and other things that I could no longer cope with. I had suffered from depression on and off since I was a teenager. 
Some of the side effects I initially experienced was fatigue and dry mouth - that went away...then the excessive sweating started. After a while, I tried to go off it because I thought &quot;well I&#039;m feeling normal, and I&#039;m tired of constant sweating&quot;. I started the slow weaning off process and bugger all, I felt myself getting more and more withdrawn and the excessive moodiness and depressed thoughts were coming back. Went back on it. 
It&#039;s helped me immensely, but like any pharmaceutical - doesn&#039;t have the same effects on everybody. It&#039;s working for me!""",5
Doxycycline,Acne,"""Monodox is awesome. Not only did it only cost $10 with their savings card but also works so well. I had taken Doryx before but couldn&#039;t tolerate it at all! I got a rash and extreme nausea (150mg) but now I started taking 100mg of Monodox in the evening with dinner and not only do I not have the rash or nausea but I also don&#039;t have the photosensitivity. Plus the Doryx pill was HUGE. These capsules are so small and easy to swallow. If you take the Monodox 75mg you can either spread the dosing or take it all at once, whatever works best for you. But for me the 100mg is perfect. I should note I also started using Ziana at night as I couldn&#039;t tolerate any of the benzoyl peroxide topicals. And starting tonight I will also add Aczone as a primer.""",4
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal has done so much good for me, especially now that it&#039;s being combined with a low dose of Zoloft. I&#039;m not depressed, I&#039;m not manic. I&#039;m just content with life now. My only complaint is that it can reduce the effectiveness of the birth control pill. The risk of pregnancy is a non-issue for me right now, but in the future, I really don&#039;t want to take that risk. But overall, I&#039;m very happy with it.""",6
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""My experience has been terrible.  I am 42 and an educated woman who works in a high capacity job and I can&#039;t function.

I finally had to go out on medical leave.   I am in the process of discontinuing all psych meds as they are ruining my life!!!""",6
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I sustained a severe concussion several months ago and could not sleep afterwards due to the injury to my brain.  It would take hours to fall asleep, only to wake up every 90 minutes and have another hour to fall back asleep.  Since the brain heals while you are sleeping, my concussion symptoms (stuttering, speech/language problems, memory loss, headaches, dizziness/vertigo) kept getting worse.   My Dr prescribed Belsomra, and gave me specific instructions: take it 1/2 hour before  bed, no screens for an hour before bed, no heavy meals after 7pm.  I started with 7.5 mg and then moved up to 10 mg a few weeks later.  My sleep is amazing, and I started to heal.  Had some funny dreams but didn&#039;t mind.  Down to 3x/wk. I am so grateful for this medicine!""",0
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""Was prescribed this medication on Friday, August 28th of this year.  So it has only been 5 days since I first started taking it .  I have never been on any anti-depressant medication before.  Didn&#039;t know I was depressed until the doctor said that I was.  I went to him with complaints of stress (mostly work-related, some personal), weight gain (seems I focus on food and cravings a lot more these days, not to mention that I had a car accident on 4/03/09 and broke my neck, had to wear a halo for 3 months so that could also explain my weight gain of almost 30lbs), and difficulty falling asleep.  Side effects so far have been; insomnia, no changes really in appetite, and failure to have an orgasm! """,5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking this medication with a doctor&#039;s supervision for a month now and have lost nearly 20 lbs! This is certainly a kick-start and I feel hopeful, having 80  more to take off. I do feel full and energized while taking it. I still have an appetite, but am able to control it much more successfully. I drink a lot of water and chew sugarless gum to help with the dry mouth issue. I have minimized my carbohydrate/red meat intake and eat much more fruit and veggies. No more diet soda/artificial sweetners. I do use small amounts of raw olive oil for vegetables and salads. I have also found that when dining out, I am now only eating half of the portion. I am a bit more irritable but will deal with it, so happy with the result!""",3
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""My son is 8yrs old and has asperger&#039;s with an emphasis in anxiety. When the doc prescribed Lexapro at 10mg he had a manic episode, but when decreased to 5mg MY SON SMILED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2YRS! For a mom there is no greater feeling. We have to occationally use an additional anxiety medicine durning periods of intense stress but for maintenance therapy it&#039;s great. I only gave it a rating of 7 due to the severe WEIGHT GAIN he has experienced. Good luck to all who suffer""",7
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 40 year old male who didn&#039;t have the benefits of medications when I was in school. ADD wasn&#039;t as well known back then. I was diagnosed with hyper dyslexia. I always thought that it was strange because I didn&#039;t see letters backwards but I just accepted it. I was officially diagnosed with ADD in my mid 20&#039;s. I have taken most of the medicine options over the past 12 years including Concerta, Strattera, Adderall, Ritalin and Ritalin LA. Couldn&#039;t sleep on Concerta, I was out of my mind with Strattera, Adderall was like popping caffeine pills and Ritalin was too high maintenance as it neutralized after 2-3 hours. Then I found Ritalin LA. It&#039;s not the magic bullet but it&#039;s the best that I have found so far. It costs me 10X generic but worth it.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking these pills last Thursday. Six days later and I have already lost 9 lbs..... My appetite is pretty much non existent I have been eating 1 meal per day and and I usually have a protein shake as a meal replacement. The first 2-3 days I didn&rsquo;t sleep at all now the only symptom I have is dry mouth. I plan on taking this medicine for as long as my doctor will allow me to. SW 238, CW 229 ,GW 170""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started phentermine  6 days ago. The first 2 days, I felt like I was in a fog. By the third day, the feeling passed. My starting weight was 273. My weight today is 266. Over Easter, I never had the urge to indulge in candy, or desserts! 10 years ago I had Lap Band surgery, and lost over 80 lbs. Since that time, I have regained about 40lbs. This medication is exactly what I need to jump start my weight loss. It suppresses  the feelings to over eat, or binge eat.""",2
Victoza,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on it for a month and I&#039;m up to 3ml. I had a lot of trouble during the month with eating, and I was very nauseous in the beginning. I was eating about 1-2 times a day but that started to wear off the 2nd week at 3ml and I&#039;m back to 3 meals a day. I&#039;ve lost 12lbs this month and I have to admit I was not as diligent with my nutrition and exercise as usual. If this works as well with partial doses and a diet not nearly as clean as usual, this gives me hope. Looks like I can finally reach my weight loss goals!""",3
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Sooooooo sick that&#039;s my main issue with this medicine I throw up daily, and I&#039;m constipated. I&#039;ve lost 12 pounds in less than 2 weeks. Started at 286 now 274 in 1.5 weeks. No diet or exercise happening. I sleep nonstop, have no energy, I&#039;m always thirsty and dehydrated.  Plus side I&#039;m never hungry, and I lost weight quickly.  I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be able to continue if the side effects are unyielding.""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""Spironolactone changed my life. I was 32 and had been battling cystic acne since 19, been through 3 dermatologists and every acne product on the market and had completely given up. I was at my annual gyno appointment when, out of the blue, she looked at me and asked me how I felt about my face. I immediately started to cry and told her how helpless and ugly I felt. Knowing that I was not interested in having kids, she put me on Spironolactone. It took a few months but once it kicked in, it was like someone had given me new skin. I am now 37, still taking 100mg of Spiro per day and my face has never looked better. It&#039;s soft and smooth and the redness is gone. It gave me my self esteem back. I only wish I could have found out about it sooner!""",4
Flurazepam,Insomnia,"""Yes - dalmane is very effective at putting and keeping you asleep.  I was prescribed it for four years before the dangers were known. By blocking neuron transmissions, mine were not communicating next day. I had a career that required thought, concentration and problem solving. I no longer could do any of that.  My professional, domestic social and economic life fell apart insidiously over that time. I became agoraphobic and withdrawn, dependent on others who told me what to do.  Recovery of my own mind took well over five years, many of them in a spin. I had been made very very ill indeed""",0
Seasonique,Birth Control,"""I usually don&#039;t write in these forums but after reading a few post, I realized that I needed to share my experiences to help someone else. I&#039;m on my 8th week of Seasonique. 
Of course I started taking it because I was attracted to the 4 periods a year. The first side effect I started experiencing was headaches, backaches and stomach cramps. It either went away or I just got used to it. 
Secondly, I noticed my face breaking out along the jaw line. This has been a problematic area for me before but never quite this severe. I get once a week facials and there was absolutely no explanation for this. 
Lastly, I&#039;ve had these non-stop hysterical crying episodes. """,8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the nexplanon back in May 2014 after I had my son. From the moment I got it I&#039;ve broken out in hives every single day. I&#039;ve been told to take allergy medicine to help. I breastfeed my son so taking all that medicine wasn&#039;t an option for me. I&#039;ve had a period for 5 months straight. No breaks no nothing. It&#039;s a great form of birth control because no sane man wants to have sex when you&#039;re bleeding all over the place. I&#039;ve been hormonal and having emotions all over the place. I&#039;m literally a ticking time bomb. Great mood when you&#039;re a mom of a toddler. I seriously can&#039;t wait to get this thing out!!""",8
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""OK so it has been exactly 2 weeks and 2 days since I had the Skyla put in. I have read multiple reviews before going with this procedure and wish I would have read more. You definitely want to take at least a  day off of work. After I had it done I was ok for about 2 hours then it just got worse. Your body really needs to relax afterwards, Think of it, you are having a device/drug put into your uterus for 3 to 6 years permanently?! Any ways I figured after a couple days cramping would stop.  I had it put in on my last day of my period FYI. On the 5th day (I&#039;m traveling for a wedding so I&#039;m on a plane) I started cramping so bad""",8
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I I&#039;ve taken Ambien, and now the generic, for 10 or 11 years. I usually took it only when sleeping away from home. The last month, or so, I&#039;ve needed it every night to fall asleep. I always try to fall asleep on my own first but it has become increasingly difficult. I have absolutely no side effects and never have had. I never get out of bed during the night and feel totally refreshed when I wake in the morning. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do without it.""",0
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I am 50. I have taken clonazepam 0.5 mg every night for 10 years. It gives me beautiful sleep. I have never needed more. I have been insomniac all my life with mild GAD. It kills the sex drive and so I try just half a tab a couple nights a week. I don&#039;t sleep very well with half tab. With all the hype about how bad it is long term, I have tried weaning back, but with poor sleep I become depressed and irritable. My estrogen is high, my testosterone has been low ever since I started taking it. I&#039;ve always wondered what connection it has with hormones. It is a wonder drug in so many ways for me. Maybe when I am finally done with menopause I will consider weaning off.""",0
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""It&#039;s been about 6 weeks on Latuda. During this time I experienced joint pain, severe anxiety and panic attacks. I have asked for advice from pharmacists, doctors and other sources. I have Ativan to help with the akathesia. Lamictal started helps with the panic and anxiety but helps the Latuda built up a wall between my brain and body.   And Latuda - I can only sleep a couple hours each night.  No drowsiness here. What I really want is to be titrated down to 20 mg and see if the side effects are negated. Otherwise looking towards seroquel...help!""",6
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""Ativan is great for anxiety flare-ups; especially when breathing or alternative methods won&#039;t cut it. However, certain manufacturers make their pills slightly differently and some seem to be more sedating and then I feel out of it. I wish there wasn&#039;t a price war for the least expensive medication so the pharmacy would stick to one brand. Even the generic isn&#039;t working to control my anxiety right now. When my pharmacy carries the right brand, it works perfectly for those fear and flee moments that I can&#039;t get under control.""",7
Cymbalta,Depression,"""I LOVED Cymbalta, I felt wonderful, no aches and pains, no depression, I had my life back. I was paying $90 for a 3 month supply... THEN it happened, my co-pay went to $1000 for a 3 month supply! I want to cry, I obviously can&#039;t afford that so I got switched to Venlafaxine, I now have a constant slight headache and it makes me nauseous, my anxiety is back. Dr. switched me to Prozac yesterday, we shall see but what I would not give to have my Cymbalta back.""",5
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Yes this drug has really bad side effects of severe headache . I suffer from migraine and I didn&#039;t know how much more of this side effect I could handle, but for me losing weight was more important than anything. 1st month everyday severe headaches but after that things got better after about 6 weeks I felt normal. Its been 6.5 months and I&#039;ve lost 40lbs. I eat extremely healthy and exercise everyday. No sugar no carbs. Its not a miracle drug you have to also change yourself. I would do it all over again. Definitely recommend it.""",3
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 19 and I started taking 100mg Vyvanse a day when I was 17. Before Vyvanse I took Focalin. I love Vyvanse except for the fact that it doesnt last for the full 12 hours. When I first started on it, my senior year in high school after I had my daughter. I had never felt so confident. I made high honors and was like smart for the first time. I was capable of being focused of what was only going on in the classroom and didn&#039;t have to worry about anything besides school. I just really hated when I would crash because then I would get tired and then didn&#039;t feel like really doing anything. I do notice side effects but other then that I think it&#039;s worth taking.""",1
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I gained a lot of weight after having my 1st son and a failed IUD. My doc prescribed Adipex 37.5 and I took it 5-6 days per week for 5 months. In the beginning it gave me extreme dry mouth and it was hard to fall asleep because of the energy boost but it suppressed my appetite A LOT and if I ate to much it made me vomit.  I started working out slowly a few times per week and by the time I stopped taking it I was working out 5 days a week. I am 5&#039;8 and my start weight was 195 my end weight was 137.After my 2nd son I lost the weight easily and got back down to 140 but after my daughter I gained and could not lose anything, my energy was low and I could not control my appetite.  As soon. As I am done breastfeeding I will be taking Adipex again""",3

I have DDD, DJD, arthritis, muscle spasms, chronic pain, COPD, asthma, CFS, and nerve damage.  What can I say.  My mind never turns of.  When I tried to get help, I was told it could not be done.  I was on a muscle relaxer and my insurance wanted me to try something else, so now I wake-up in the middle of the night.  I am also on Oxycontin 40mgs for pain, trazodone has been a life saver.  I just wish I could find away to stop pain.  Just don&#039;t know what will happen.""",0
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I have been on diet pills off and on for more than 15 years Phentermine and Bontril. They have just lost there effectivess with my body from just prolonged use.

I weighed in at 260. 06/04/14 I checked my weight this morning because I just felt so much better and I&#039;m weighing in at 255.2. It&#039;s so encouraging to see the scale go down instead of up. I know the first week or so of weightloss is usually water weight but I&#039;m still encouraged..Will keep you posted of my progress my goal is to weight between 175-185 for my height and body structure that is what my doctor recommends.""",2
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Had started to experience insomnia about ten years ago after a shoulder injury, even after that healed I had a horrible time getting to sleep, I could not turn my mind off. I was prescribed this medication and had some initial side effects but the medication works for me. I think I have became addicted to it, there have been some days I did not take it or could not afford it and when that happened I could not fall asleep. Ambien gives me a good night&#039;s rest and I wake up feeling refreshed.""",0
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Took this drug because my antidepressant was causing horrible mood swings. It works well and quickly, and side effects are not awful. Only problem was I would have really intense episodes of heavy breathing/heartbeat, with twitching and then I would barely be able to move for a while. Hopefully as I get used to it, this should go away. But great medication, really helped my mood and mental clarity!""",6
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Latuda 40mg since January 2012. I was prescribed it to help me sleep because I suffer with a severe case of insomnia. I had tried many different types of medicines to help knock me out. My Dr had tried Saphris but I was experiencing all the severe side effects. So my Dr discontinued that medicine and started me on Latuda 40mg. The medicine worked very well with my mood swings and insomnia. It wasn&#039;t until the past couple weeks that I haven&#039;t been able to sleep anymore. So my Doctor decided to increase my dosage to 80mg. I&#039;m on night one but its 4:30am and still not sleeping. I&#039;m also on Depakote and Lexapro.""",6
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Of all medications I have taken for mental illnesses, Seroquel has been the most effective. It started working almost immediately. At first 25mg nightly, then 50mg, to 75mg, to 100mg only at bed time due to the drowsiness that accompanies it. I now take 150mg at bed and 25mg with breakfast and 25mg at lunch time which is keeping anxiety at bay. It required an increase monthly for me until now. The biggest benefit was treatment of insomnia, which in turn helped me manage my days better. It hasn&#039;t been effective in preventing or even reducing the effects of mania which is why it didn&#039;t get a full 10/10 from me. The worse side effect has been the constant weight gain.""",6
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Retin-A is great. It helps a lot. It was september 2014 when I decided to go to a dermatologist. She recommended Glycolic Soap (Use night and day), Clarifying Toner in the morning, Clindamycin (night and day), RA Gel every night, and Skinlite cream in the morning for the scars. Last march 2015, My face is already smooth. People were saying that it looks great. Now it&#039;s June 2015 and I&#039;m still using RA Gel and Clindamycin, just to maintain my skin. Reminder: Please when you start using RA Gel, do not stop. The pimples will come back... Worse!""",4

My doc did say that the weight usually melts off of people, so we will see!
I took phentermine a few times. The first time I lost 15 lbs in a month, but it made my heart rate faster and it gave me very bad anxiety. I&#039;m glad there&#039;s another option that doesn&#039;t have the bad side effects. 

I do know that the cost is astronomical for Saxenda, so my doc is giving me samples for now. My private insurance doesn&#039;t cover it at all.""",2

That was what the Dr. recommended. Did not sleep at all. Next day I tried 20 mg. Ever hear of sleep paralysis? Well 20 mg I got sleepy. I was impressed. I started to dose off and the sleep paralysis started to hit me. I got up and made some coffee and I won&#039;t take them anymore.Google sleep paralysis and you&#039;ll find it is not pleasant to say the least. And they wanted $300.00 for 30. Ended up with 10 for free with a coupon. Got 8 1/2 left and will not use the anymore.Took it 4 hours ago.Zolpidem beats this belsomra by far. I rate belsomra in the negative 10.

After trying Neurontin for break through pain I have high hopes to replace the Morphine with the Neurontin, which has recently been approved to be used in the pump by the FDA. After staying on the Neurontin slowly but surely all side effects were gone. Just the dry mouth continues but that&#039;s okay.""",9
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started taking adipex 6/30 and it&#039;s now 7/4. My weight has not changed. I&#039;m having side effects like chest pain,  shortness of breath, extreme fatigue -no energy at all. I still pushed myself to workout and eat right. My weight at weight loss clinic was 228 but when I got on scale at public it said 232.  Because of pills serious side effects I have to stop taking pills. Best of luck to you all.""",3
Ambien,Insomnia,"""People, be careful with Ambien. I was put on Ambien 10 mg back in late 2014, I recently stopped the medication told turkey. It&#039;s been a week since I quit, I have been having severe withdrawal. Nightmares, night sweats, and frequent urination are the most occurring symptoms I have been dealing with. Doctors seldom tell patients about drug withdrawals, which is why I am suffering from these problems. So, be careful before you take a new prescribed medication.""",0
Lidoderm,Pain,"""Had a spinal fusion back in 2000 and over the years on and off I have used the Watson Lidocaine 5% patches.  Last year my insurance sent me Mylan.  What a waste of time and money.  Who thought of manufacturing plastic patches for the skin.  They not only pinch the skin but also don&#039;t stick, at all!
I can&#039;t imagine if I was walking in the summer and had one on. Shame on you Mylan, a call to customer service was to no avail.  The cost of the Watson Brand (which I loved) is so expensive now. 
I won&#039;t be ordering them anymore.  The point is Mylan&#039;s co-pay was affordable but didn&#039;t stick and Watson co-pay is too much.""",9
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had insomnia for twenty years. I&#039;ve tried everything and only Ambien works for me. Knowing this, my doctor suddenly wants to to try Belsomra and gave me all the free samples- 5, 10, 20 mg. they all give me nightmares. Not just standard nightmares- like the worst possible nightmares, vivid and frightening nightmares for hours straight. Then I would wake multiple times and be wide awake. I threw all those pills in the trash. I would not recommend Belsomra to anyone for insomnia. It&#039;s a total marketing scam. And here&#039;s the kicker- the company knows that this medication causes nightmares and doesn&#039;t list it as a side effect. Sad.""",0
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I love Xenical. It is basically making me scared to eat rubbish because of the oily poo side effect,  with a very urgent need to &#039;go&#039; it is making me look at food in a different way. If I see a family size chocolate bar, which previously I would have eaten within 2 minutes, I just see it as a slab of fat. It has changed my attitude towards food.  I now eat healthy food because I know what the unhealthy food will look like as it comes out and I am disgusted that all of that unhealthy fat was going into my body, into my arteries, around my heart.  It has been a visual education in healthy eating.  I am losing weight and it&#039;s thanks to Xenical. """,2
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""Excellent for anxiety, especially if you start with the minimum amount, 0.25 mg and only take more if needed. I say this because I was prescribed 0.5 mg 3x daily and don&#039;t need that much. Try to take the least amount and if that works don&#039;t take more since you can build up a slight tolerance over time. My only concern is will I ever be able to be off of medicine. I just wish there was a natural cure for anxiety. I hate being dependent on this.""",7
Voltaren Gel,Pain,"""I was diagnosed with  neuropathy in my right knee down to my foot. This pain started when I was pregnant with my first son 23 years ago. It has gotten worse over the years. To make matters worse, I tore ligaments in my ankle from a fall at work. Finally after worker&#039;s comp. only with my ankle, I was referred to a neurologist. They did many tests and indicated that it was a sensory  nerve injury. He gave me a sample of this gel and told me to apply it 4x a day. It worked wonders. Pain was gone! I hope it continues to works this well in the future.""",9
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I am a chronic worrier. I wake up in the morning worrying about something. My doctor prescribed Alprazolam about 3 years ago, up to 2 x 0.5 mg tablets a day as needed. I do not like to take medication, but Alprazolam takes the heaviness out of my chest and breathing is easier, and I feel relaxed. It is amazing. No side effects. It helps me at work if I have meetings, or have to talk in front of a group. I wish I did not need it, but thank God it is there at this time. 10 out of 10.""",7
Bupropion,Depression,"""This medication is very activating without making me anxious. I take it for depression, but I also have general anxiety disorder, and OCD. I was a little worried about taking it at first because one of the side effects indicated that it could make anxiety worse, but I didn&#039;t have that problem at all. It definitely helps with depression and lifting my mood. It&#039;s not a &quot;happy pill,&quot; but it is good with getting and keeping you going and not letting depression ruin you and keep you from doing what needs to be done and living your life.""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started contrave on Feb 2 2017, since then I am down 14lbs. I only eat when I am hungry and I stopped craving foods. The only side effected I experience was crazy dreams. I stopped smoking 2 years ago and gained all my weight, not only am I losing weight, it stopped cigarette cravings. It has made me more alert of my surroundings plus making healthy decisions. I&#039;m now taking 4 pills a day and I love it. If you have struggled to lose weight I highly suggest that you give this a chance.""",2
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had horrible acne, including a ton of cystic pimples all on my cheeks and a few on my forehead. I also have chest acne and back acne. I started taking doxycycline hyclate about 2 months ago and at first I felt like giving up and stop taking it. I didn&#039;t know the pill made you feel nauseous and I took it with a full glass of water and felt sick. A friend of mine told me she was taking the same pill and her doctor said if it makes you feel sick take food with it. So I did and I still take it today along with erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide. My skin has cleared up so much and I&#039;m not constantly breaking out anymore. My skin isn&#039;t perfect but it is much better and it is slowly getting better. I will continue to take this antibiotic, I love it.""",4
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""For the past month I have been taking trazodone 25mg for my chronic insomnia. It has simply saved me. Before if I could get about 3 hours of sleep I would be happy. Since I have been taking trazodone I sleep about 6 hours every night and I&#039;m able to function normally during the day. Before I was completely exhausted all the time and I would be scared of the thought of going to bed. Now this insomnia anxiety has completely gone away. The only negative thing is I do tend to have big mood swings. But I&#039;m not sure whether it has anything to do with the medicine itself or simply my life situation. Overall - it cured my insomnia but not my depression.""",0
Xanax,Anxiety,"""The fastest acting anti anxiety medication I&#039;ve ever been prescribed, and by far the most effective.  The anxiety I experienced prior to medication was crippling, I would stay in bed all day and not want to leave my house to go to school, or anything that involved other social interaction.  This medicine got me up, happy, and willing/wanting to do the things I could not do before.  However, through prolonged use of this medication I have as a result become addicted, as when I do not receive my scheduled dose I feel withdrawals.  Overall - this medication has done so many good things for me I would be content taking this until the end of time, for the pros outweigh the cons, tenfold.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been using phentermine for 3 weeks and I&#039;ve lost 13 pounds with no exercise that being said I don&#039;t just sit around all day either. And I have not changed what I eat at all but it just makes me eat so much less and not be hungry. Also listen to the label when it says eat afterwards. Days when I took my pill on a empty stomach I felt tired and sluggish all day.  But once my stomach shrunk and I&#039;ve gotten used to my new eating habit I have no problems other then the dry mouth gives me bad breath so I&#039;ve been brushing like three times a day. Also I&#039;ve been told that when you stop if you are not on a good diet and exercise schedule you will gain it all back.. Just something to keep in mind...overall great product!""",3
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression. It has worked wonders when I start to suffer. I take 1 mg in the morning and I feel like my old self again. However, I&#039;m starting to wonder if it is causing some of my depression. Once the medicine wears off my mood crashes. I get very emotional, anxiety creeps up, agitated, and very depressed. I pop another one and my mood stabilizes.
Another thing, it is very habit forming so don&#039;t stop taking it abruptly. Consult your doctor first for a plan.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking phentermine 37.5mg on May 5 and I have changed the way I eat but mainly just portion control and no sodas and a lot of water. I don&#039;t eat after 8pm and I have lost 6 lbs so far. However I am not experiencing the energy or the appetite suppressing that everyone says. I seem to still feel hungry even after I take the pill. I&#039;m not going to give up - I will give it at least 3 weeks.""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I began taking phentermine three days ago. The only side effect I have experienced has been dry mouth. Biotene mouthwash and mouth spray have helped along with lots of water. My appetite is suppressed greatly, which is wonderful. My biggest issue has been snacking late at night. My nights have not been filled with thoughts of restaurants and gourmet meals. I&#039;m not much of a sweets eater; I love good cooking. I didn&#039;t even crave anything for the past couple of nights. It&#039;s been two days, and I&#039;m down three pounds already. I weighed in at Weight Watchers today, and I&#039;m exactly 270 today. I&#039;ll update in a week. Feeling excited!""",3
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""So far I have had the paragard for about 4 months and I can&#039;t complain. It&#039;s good for 10 years and after recently giving birth to my second child I love the long term option. It&#039;s been effective so far. But there are some down sides, heavy bleeding definitely is a factor is deciding if you want it. When I say heavy I mean changing a tampon almost 6-8 times a day. But in my opinion it&#039;s worth it. Also the cramps are not great. They feel like mild contractions, again to me it&#039;s worth not getting pregnant again. Insertion was not bad compared to the reviews that I read before getting it. I believe having kids factors into the amount of pain there is. Basically it was a minor pinch and that was it! That day I forgot I had even got it.""",8
Restoril,Insomnia,"""For months been having severe insomnia. Waking 3 or 4 times during the night, never getting more than 4 hours of sleep. Twice in the span of a week and a half no sleep at all. Always feeling tired but not drowsy. I was given prescription for 10.-15mg of Restoril by an ER doctor. Took half a dose one afternoon and slept for 3 hours. Took the other half that early evening and knocked out after 20 minutes and slept for 6 hours. No side effects. Feeling better. """,0
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""This is a great birth control method, at least for me anyway. I&#039;ve seen a lot of negative reviews that scared me into getting it. I&#039;m so happy I decided to get the Nexplanon. The insertion was nothing. Just a little stinging from the needle they numb your arm with. My arm bruised pretty bad but they are yellowing now. Sometimes when I move my arm a certain way I feel a slight pinch but I imagine it&#039;ll go away eventually since the area is still sensitive. So far no side effects. I lost a lb, no acne, no headaches and I haven&#039;t bled or spotted. Try it ladies! Don&#039;t be scared. Remember most people take the time to write negative reviews.""",8
Minocycline,Acne,"""I went to dermatologist because of some minor adult acne on my chin and was prescribed minocycline 100mg one a day. Well come Nov 1 will be 1 month in, and the very couple of acne I had on my chin has tripled plus I now have it on my cheeks, which I never had a problem before. Plus I have had some side effects as well, including dizziness, nauseas and yeast infection. It was prescribed to me for 3 months. I will stick with it for another 2 mths and see what happens. As of right now I am disappointed, but am hoping to see positive results in next 2 mths.""",4
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I found Xenical to work very well. True it did have side effects, but that was a good motivator to make healthier food choices. When I was food wise, I didn&#039;t have any problems. I lost 10 pounds in 1.5 months walking 10,000 steps per day and eating healthy.

I did get the headaches associated with the side effects, but they weren&#039;t as bad as my normal sinusitis headaches, so it was do-able.
I would recommend this to anyone in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise. Exercise is a must, because this does not speed your metabolism up.

Have faith, stay strong and you can do ANYTHING you put your mind to.""",2
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was very hopeful when starting Saphris, but it didn&#039;t take long for my family and I to see this was NOT the medication for me. I asked doctors to take me of this but I kept on being told to give it more time. I would sleep over 12 hours a day and if I could SOMEHOW manage to stay up with the use of coffee and energy drinks, I was a shell. I would sit there confused, unable to really talk or take care of myself. I took it twice a day once in the morning and once before bed, and rather than give me my life it was robbing me of what little I had.

It also didn&#039;t help with my delusions or paranoid thinking. I even still saw shadows and things of that nature from time to time.""",6
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am a 15 year old female. I started taking Vyvanse around 5 months ago. When I first started taking it I saw a difference immediately. I was always on 50mg. It made me very irritable and emotional the first times I took it. Currently, I&#039;ve been taking this for a few months and it is starting to become less effective on me. I am now starting to double up my doses taking 50mg to 100mg a day. It gets me through the day and keeps me awake. Not to mention excellent grades in school.""",1
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I got my implant about 4 months ago, since then I&#039;ve had really long and heavy periods, spotting for maybe 2 weeks then I might stop all together for about a week, start spotting then have the heavy, prolonged period. I haven&#039;t had any other side effects such as the nausea and head aches like it said I would. I am getting more acne than I&#039;ve ever had though. I&#039;m just worried about these never ending periods.""",8
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""Started Qsymia in Sept. 2013 weighing 198 lbs, I&#039;m 52 yo, 5&#039;5&quot; female with 3 kids, have lost 45 lbs to date.  Only side effects were tingling in toes occasionally, but not any more.  I&#039;m very active around the house and yard but do not exercise, keeping daily calorie count below 1200 with healthy foods and plenty of fluids.  This was my last attempt at losing weight - AND IT WORKED!!  And it does NOT make me crazy and wound up like other meds did in the past.  Have been spreading the word to friends and family since first seeing the results!!!!!""",3
Dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 46 and was diagnosed with ADHD 2 times when I was a kid but never took the medicine. My life&#039;s always felt out of control and emotional roller coaster. I tried Adderall first but it made me to jumpy. I switched to Dextroamphetamine and once I got past the first week and up to my 20 mg a day everything became so much easier to deal with in life. Less stress, better sleep at night and makes me feel &quot;normal&quot;. Best medicine in the world but the cost is absolutely ridiculous as I have no insurance.""",1
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""Ok as a first time user I&#039;m going to give my honest answer based on usage for 3 days now. So my doc prescribed me these because I have developed anxiety disorder. Well, I decided to take these when I start to feel panicked. After 20 minutes or so. I&#039;m easy. Thoughts simmer down. Mind stop racing and negative thoughts seem to push to the back and not to the front as usual.  They make me feel mellow and laid back..Mind you. I&#039;m not a drug user of any type so that&#039;s probably why they work so well for me. I keep them with me all the time. They don&#039;t make me drowsy. However, if I&#039;m relaxed. I can definitely dose off. I recommend these if they are the only medicine you are taking.  It seems to work best in my clean system. Hope this helps""",7
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I was put on Klonopin about 8 months ago...My bp would not come down with lisipril so the Dr put me on Klons, Valium, and Lexapro to stop whatever was going on... She stopped the valium but im still on the lexapro and klons...Im prescribed 90 klons 1mg a month and 60 10mgs lexapros a month...Well those didnt work but the lexapro and klons did with my anxiety  but now im on Azor 10/40 again to try to get it down...Anxiety sucks and I dont wish it on my worst enemy... Well maybe...lol""",7
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I usually don&#039;t give reviews but for Adipex is necessary that I share with you. I started on 3/4/14 at 215 pounds, today 4/7/14 I&#039;m @ 198lbs. In only 33 days I&#039;ve lost 17 lbs. I&#039;m eating healthy and small portions, cause I don&#039;t get hungry.. I don&#039;t crave nor look for fast food restaurants. I&#039;ve added more fruits and veggies into my menu. I&#039;m staying away from sugar and bread. I&#039;m thirsty all the time, water, water is my best friend. If you are reading this I was just like you 30 days ago reading and trying to find out if this would work, and my answer is &quot;YES&quot; it does. Just take it day by day and eat right and exercise. Will give my next update at the end of April.""",2
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Ambien is a wonderful sleep aid.  For people who have trouble staying asleep, this is the medication for you.  I&#039;ve been taking it for at least 10 years and I&#039;ve not built up a tolerance to it yet.  Don&#039;t get out of bed after taking it as it does pose a risk of falling because it works very quickly and will make you very drowsy and perhaps dizzy.    It helps me sleep for 7-8 hours without any hangover effect.  Unfortunately my &quot;nanny&quot; prescription insurance has just informed me that it will not pay for my opioid pain medication and ambien together so I have to choose which medication I want the insurance to pay for.  I&#039;ll just pay the $54 for it myself as the 2 alternative drugs my doctor suggested have quite scary user reviews.""",0
Prozac,Depression,"""Horrible experience with Prozac! Started taking it on  a Thursday, and by Saturday had a buzzing in my ears, a full feeling in my head, and couldn&#039;t sleep. On Sunday, I completely lost my appetite, and became very jittery. I was barely able to work on Monday, and called off Tuesday because of generalized anxiety, not sleeping or eating.  I ended up taking three total days off of work due to side effects.  I literally had to force myself to eat a single slice of toast for breakfast... and barely got it down! I finally went off of it on Wednesday and went back on paxil.  By Friday, I am feeling like my old self again.  Plus, I had startling dreams.  I won&#039;t ever take this drug again!""",5
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I am a 23 year old female and have suffered from mild/moderate acne since the age of 12 my main problem area is my chin. I have tried every path to clear this including diet/skin care(several different brands)/water/exercise to clear my skin but the only thing that ever works and I find myself going back to is Doxycycline. I have taken it on and off for over 10 years. I wish i could find a more natural path to clear my skin but Doxy is so effective for me and it works within days. I have zero side effects.""",4
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien on and off for 8 years for severe insomnia, mostly related to anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder. Over time my body has built up a dependence and a tolerance. I will lay awake till 5 am if I don&#039;t take it miserable and exhausted for days. The generic doesn&#039;t seen to work as well and since I have been on it so long I usually have to take 20mg to get a full nights sleep, but with certain generics I still wake up at 3am and can&#039;t go back to bed. It has been a God send over the years as I tried everything else. I was treated for depression but those medications made it harder to sleep. At some point I would like to stop being dependent on the medicine but every time I try to quit I go through weeks of with no sleep.""",0
Butrans,Pain,"""Was using Butrans 20 dose.  Chronic joint pain since childhood.  Was using  Hyrdocodone and Gabapentin.  Patch was amazing at controlling pain from day 1.  Lost 5 lbs due to stomach uneasiness, loss of appetite.  I had no marks at patch sites.  At 7 weeks every spot where a patch had been used erupted in blisters.  It was very odd and now 2 weeks later the red spots are finally receding.  Pain control 100%, stomach and bowel issues manageable.  """,9
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""So far I am on day three of taking Duloxetine and I already want to be off of it.

I have been taking the drug at night as I read that it can cause serious drowsiness. Since I already felt drowsy before taking the drug, I didn&#039;t want this to end up being worse. I get up every hour and each time, I am wide awake. This has been the second day where I have gotten up at 3AM and haven&#039;t been able to go back to sleep. 

I have never taken steroids, but after all I&#039;ve heard, I feel like I&#039;m on one. I&#039;m starving all of the time. Right after I eat, I feel like I haven&#039;t eaten for hours. My muscles have been tightening up, my jaw clenches and I grind my teeth. The worst part is that I&#039;m easily agitated and angered by the smallest of things.""",7
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I take 300mg of XR, have for about two years now: 150 before bed and 150 midday (300 before bed was suppressing REM sleep). It has managed symptoms such as severe suicidal impulses/ideation, however overall I find that it barely sedates me. So I also take 10mg of Maximum strength Melatonin which seems to work in conjunction with the medication to allow me to sleep.
Overall it seems to be somewhat effective, although I would like to take a higher dose or switch to another medication, however my doctor wants to eventually taper me off of it completely. Previously I have been unable to afford my medication and went without for 32 or so hours, the withdrawal was HORRIBLE, I felt sick then tried to sleep and couldn&#039;t due to severe spins/vertigo.""",6
Duac,Acne,"""Well I&#039;m a bit confused. I started using this 2 weeks ago and the other day I commented to my husband that my skin had really cleared up and I was feeling much better. Yesterday I came up all red and blotchy and itchy and today it looks even worse. Not sure if I&#039;ve used too much or should have washed it off about an hour later or what but I look absolutely hideous - now plastering my face in E45 and hoping it goes down soon""",4
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I&#039;m a 68 year-old male and I&#039;ve taken this drug for almost 10 years and it has helped me enormously. I have had no side effects yet my doctor now says he wants me to get off it. I asked why and he said Ambien is dangerous. After 10 years now it&#039;s dangerous? I now am cutting down to 1/4 of 5mg and it is not working. I asked what options do I have and he said &quot;natural sleep is best&quot; Thanks, doctor.""",0
Dalmane,Insomnia,"""I have only been on Dalmane for a few days, actually only have needed to take it like three times (not in a row) because it is so powerful that Im actually tired in the morning, but a good kind of tired....    Restoril I would wake up between 3-4am wide awake like I slept for 15 hours when it had only been 4 hours!  I like the fact that I do not need to take it everyday which is an added benefit for me! and I agree with the previous posts, it does give me a calmer effect in the mornings.  I actually SLEEP throughout the whole night, and I do not have a &quot;blackout&quot; effect that I have with other sleep rx&#039;s   where I do not remember what happened during the night if I did anything....   not my thing!!!    I had no idea it was an old medication.""",0
Oxcarbazepine,Anxiety,"""This has been the most amazing medicine for major depression and chronic fatigue. It has literally changed my life. I have lived over twenty years with severe Major Depression and nothing has ever come close to giving me the quality of life that this has. A very long story short this medicine has helped myself, my son and my husband. I will never again go without it.
I must stress that you have to take the time to figure out the dose that&#039;s right for you! I doesn&#039;t happen overnight.
Good luck to all of you in your struggle.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""As far as the birth control working, it does. I got it in May of 2015 and I have not had a period since then and didn&#039;t get pregnant. It&#039;s convenient. 

I had it removed because I delevoped HORRIBLE acne it&#039;s never been a problem until the birth control. Also I couldnt seem to loose weight before the pill I lost 70 pounds and I couldnt seem to loose any weight and did what my nutritionist and personal trainer told me. Once getting off my face cleared and I&#039;m finally loosing my weight again.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I agree this product will make you drop the pounds. I took it a few years ago to lose weight after having a baby. In 6 weeks I lost 17 lbs. I have gained that wieght back plus more. I&#039;ve decided to try it again. I have so much energy I can&#039;t sit still. The down side is I can&#039;t concentrate. I&#039;m very moody. I can&#039;t fall asleep for at least an hour after going to bed. Sometimes I can feel my heart beating to fast. If I don&#039;t start showing serious weight loss I may stop taking it because of all the side effects.""",3
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I really like doxycycline. I have had mild acne since I was 11, however once I turned 19 I began having more frequent outbreaks on my face and severe outbreaks on my neck and chest. At first when I began taking this medicine it literally made me feel like my skin was on fire and caused excessive feeling. I then realized that the cleanser (clean and clear) that I was using along with doxycycline was causing this to happen. This makes your skin EXTREMELY sensitive, so be careful not to use anything too harsh on your skin or anything that will dry it out too much. Other than that, I love it! I have mild stomach discomfort, but it doesn&#039;t bother me too much. I was on it for six months and my face had cleared entirely and my back almost entirely!""",4
Zoloft,Depression,"""I love, love, love my Zoloft.  It&#039;s been a life-saver.  I&#039;m on 25 mg and I did have some insomnia and jitteriness for the first two weeks but that has subsided.  Doctor tried to &quot;up&quot; my doseage to 50mg but side effects came back and I was happy at 25mg so I went back down in dosage and I&#039;m content.  For the first time in my life I feel like I have some self-control and not constantly on the verge of a meltdown. I feel put back together and I can enjoy my family. I am a 35 year old female who works full time and have two children.""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Mirena inserted 2.5 years ago. The insertion was slightly painful but I&#039;m good with pain. It wasn&#039;t till I left my doctors that I felt sharp cramps, which only lasted a day. At first I loved Mirena. I honestly can&#039;t take anyone&#039;s experience with Mirena less than a year seriously. That&#039;s because the first year of me having it I too thought it was amazing. No having to worry about the pill everyday, no bleeding, no pregnancy ! It was amazing, until about 9 months in. I started to get severe hormonal chin acne, mood swings, hair loss and dryness. I got my first BV infections, and the worst yeast infections. My sex drive is non existing anymore so that birth control within it own! Biggest factor was how crazy it&#039;s made me.""",8
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I initially was prescribed this a few months ago at 10 mg 3xd, but it made me headachy and almost made my anxiety worse, so I quit taking it. I cannot take benzos, and recently am having more problems with anxiety, so I&#039;m trying it at 5 mg 3xd. Now I see what others have been talking positively about. It&#039;s very subtle, but apparently I was just taking too much for my system before. So far, so good.""",7
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I first got Implanon in July of 2011 and a month later I had my period for about a week, maybe a little longer which was strange for me because it usually only lasts a few days. It was very light though. I did get some acne due to the Implanon but after a couple of weeks it went away. I also still get the mood swings, but that could just be me..Now its been 2 months and I was scared because I haven&#039;t had my period at all but with reading other reviews I guess its normal. I absolutely love Implanon and I recommend it to any girl who is thinking about it!""",8
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had sleep issues for years and after having multiple sleep studies done as well as nasal surgery to fix deviated septum, I tried a dental sleep appliance and a c-pap machine and nothing worked. I was finally given Doxepin - OMG LIFESAVER...6 drops per night and I am out like a light wake up around 5 hours later but refreshed and not tired. However, if I go off routine, as in different time-zones, late nights, it does take a while to get back on track...I&#039;d be in a mental health institution if I hadn&#039;t found this as I was at the end of the rope and couldn&#039;t cope anymore being constantly exhausted.""",0
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""Cymbalta worked somewhat on my obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression better than other medicines. However, I felt like I couldn&#039;t do much. I had zero energy even though I took my dose (60mgs) at night. It became too tiring to even make myself something to eat. I did not want to go anywhere or do anything because I didn&#039;t have the energy. 
At higher doses (90 mgs), I had stomach upset and pains if I did not take my dose with food. I would also have diarrhea/loose stools at the higher dose. 
Sexual side effects were decreased interest and desire in sex. Could be attributed to just not having the energy to enjoy it. 
It did help with my OCD and lowered my anxiety but did not help my depression.""",7
Accutane,Acne,"""I&#039;m eighteen, and I&#039;ve had bad acne for all of my life; constant zits around my mouth, on my chin and forehead, and lots of blackheads on my nose, and my skin type was really frustrating; oily and greasy, yet dry all the time. Wash your face with water as hot as you can stand it for a while, or try steaming it, then slap some of the Lady Soma &quot;Antioxidant Berry Masque&quot;; it&#039;s incredible. 

It will dry on your skin;  then wash it off.  If you have red irritating pimples, you&#039;ll notice a change overnight; and if you use it every night, your skin will rock. The cool thing is, Accutane also shrinks and minimizes the little pocks that zits leave in your face; I used to have them really bad under my eyes, they&#039;re almost non-existant now.""",4
Abilify,Depression,"""I was prescribed this medication after I  already tried lithium and seroquel. The lithium helped me a lot &amp; the seroquel gave me bad headaches. So they put me on abilify. I could not sleep no matter what I took to help, I was restless , I threw up , my body temperature switched from hot to cold rapidly. I couldn&#039;t stand without being dizzy. It was the worst experience. My depression was better but my anxiety was insane. Definitely not worth the side effects""",5
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I have been taking this medicine for a little over two years, but I recently stopped. It is a WONDERFUL medicine for doing what it&#039;s supposed to do: making you sleep and stopping your racing thoughts. I don&#039;t regret taking it, because I badly needed it at the time. However, this medicine has HORRIBLE side effects. For me, they outweigh the benefits. I developed an intestinal problem, high blood sugar, and gained over 30 pounds that I could not lose no matter what I tried. I also feel like my mind is slower, and I can no longer retain as much information. I would not recommend taking this medication long term. There are also other negative effects that I was lucky enough not to experience.""",0
Mirtazapine,Insomnia,"""For years I suffered from anxiety attacks, depression and severe insomnia. I was prescribed many different drugs in the past but nothing helped me sleep. I was started on 30mgs at bedtime. It helped me sleep a bit better but still not all night. After 1 month of taking 30mg of Remeron my doctor decreased dosage to 15mgs. Amazing. A full nights sleep. Waking near sunrise! What a gift! The increased appetite was much worse on 30mgs. Since the dosage is now 15mgs the increased appetite is not nearly as bad. My anxiety attacks are few and far between and I don&#039;t feel groggy when I wake now. In the beginning I did. I have been on the medicines for about 4 months and am very happy with it. Just wish a doctor had prescribed it to me a long time ago. Best of luck!""",0
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""It has been a miricale!! I have been on several medications and nothing has helped. I have continued to bounce from depression to mania, with little sleep. I&#039;ve been on this medication for five days WOW is all I can say. I feel wonderful. I&#039;m sleeping again. No racy thoughts, none of the symptoms that I suffer from. I just hope it last. The cost is a problem but the company is working on helping me with that!!""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""Female age 40 height 5&#039;2 305lbs. Started Contrave on 3/29/17. Week 1 I lost 6lbs!! Now 299lbs. I am pre diabetic and my doctor put me on Metformin. This was a BIG wake up call for me. I feel mentally ready to do this. So far symptoms have been nothing bad a few stomach cramps, food taste blah, a little nausea but only when I don&#039;t drink enough water. I do go to the bathroom more often about 4 times a day. I don&#039;t have cravings and I feel full. I have changed my diet big time, no carbs, fish and lean meats, lots of eggs, tons of water and small snacks throughout the day. I feel good, no tiredness like others that I read. I will continue to update weekly, I feel this will make me accountable and it may help someone who is like me struggling.""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been taking Victoza for about 7 months now.  I have lost almost 50lbs and I feel great.  I had gastric bypass 10 years ago, lost almost 100lbs and regained it due to a medical issue.  I have taken and participated in countless other weight loss products/programs and have found that Victoza as produced about the same amount of weight loss as with having the gastric bypass.  The side effects were minimal, nausea for the first two months sporadically, but I took it with a grain of salt, realizing that it will pass.  Again, I&#039;d Say Yes to trying Victoza all while under the care of a physician.""",2
Methamphetamine,ADHD,"""MUCH BETTER than Adderall, Vyvanse, or Dexedrine, or Ritalin.  IT is more effective for performing my scores on tests and learning.  It is better for the social anxiety component of ADHD. It is neurotoxic so you may not want to stay on it for the entire year, however, IT DOES have medical value at low doses if used by RESPONSIBLE users for several months out of the year. IT IS very effective for controlling treatment resistant depression and appetite problems as well. However, appetite would return to baseline when stopping Desoxyn.  I think this medicine should be strictly controlled, but should be available to patients who could truly benefit from it.  It has helped me get through a very difficult year, but my doctor took me off it. """,1
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I have been taking 4 of the 40mg for about two years, because it works better than anything else I have had, and that is every other narcotic, for my spondilolisthesis. It kills the pain and I can work like a 20 year old and do everything I want, but without it, I feel like the 48 year old I am. I highly recommend this pain medicine to anyone with chronic pain. I would much rather take these than have bone fusion surgery. """,9
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Ok sooo I started taking Belviq on July 11,2015. I took 1 pill at 9a I started feeling like I was intoxicated, dizzy &amp; very tired for like a 1/2 an hour. Then my  muscles began to feel alil achy  in both arms,my cheeks on my  face started feeling achy like I had been smiling for 2hrs &amp;lil lower back pain. It all was just  alil discomfort nothing too  alarming that I needed any  pain meds for. After a couple    hours it had passed &amp; so did my appetite. Once I noticed the  time it was 7p so I made                 myself eat a salad &amp; took the 2nd pill. I didnt like the 2nd dosage because it made me feel dizzy &amp; like I just came from a bar.

Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m a 26 year old female and been taking Straterra for 2 weeks for ADD and I love it. Straterra has been a miracle for me.

I am experiencing some of the side effects, dry mouth, chills weight loss and I don&#039;t eat near as much but I needed to lose weight and ate to much before taking the drug.

Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been on Victoza since Jan 9th. I am impressed with how well things are going. I was diagnosed as insulin resistant and am overweight and would like to lose 70 lbs. I have lost 20 lbs so far. I modified my diet and faithfully use a fit bit daily to log my activity, diet and glucose levels.

Since taking Provigil I have moved forward and been able to complete and follow through on projects and not get frustrated and anxious. Have had no side effects, nor have I experienced a come off effect. I&#039;m stable as she goes all day long. It has not effected my sleep either.""",1
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I have been taking gabapentin for about 6 years now.
I have 2 collapsed discs in my sacroid spine which have been causing chronic pain for 9 years .
I take 500mg 3 times a day but can increase it when the pain becomes unbearable.
On the higher doses I do get drowsy, but in my normal dose it doesn&#039;t affect me. It just helps reduce the nerve pain.
The only side effect I get is a dry mouth.
At the moment I am suffering from shingles and it is a godsend.
I have had shingles previously and wasn&#039;t taking gabapentin at the time and the neuropathy pain was awful.
I also find it helps a bit with my fibromyalgia.""",9
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I have used many types of birth controls from the patch, the pill, the ring, and now the shot. I would always forget to take my pill so I decided to make the switch to depo. Although I love that I never have to think about taking my birth control, the depo shot makes me spot, a lot. To me it&#039;s not worth it. I  always spotting and have ruined countless underwear. I knew there would be some spotting but the spotting has not stopped. I would rather take the pill and have a regular period than have to spot every day.""",8
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I have been on every medication out there to help with my anxiety,/depression.  I was taking effexor which worked at first but I noticed that my head was just filled with unnecessary garbage to say the least.  My Dr took me off of the effexor and replaced it with brintellix and saphris which really helped my moods and depression.  But my anxiety was still affecting me to the point I thought I was having a stroke.  He prescribed my 1 mg of Xanax 3 times a day and wow!  The difference is night and day!  I am actually able to function normally and am so relieved.  I&#039;m still scared to be taking it because of the addiction that can come with it,  but with my Dr&#039;s guidance I am feeling better about this medication.  My anxiety has subsided! Grateful!""",7
Skyla,Birth Control,"""In May of 2010 I went into labor at 20 weeks but other than that I do not have any kids. I typically have a high pain tolerance but when I went and got the Skyla put in I started having contractions. This lasted for about 30 minutes and of course did not feel very good. I cramped for the rest of the day, but other than that haven&#039;t had any &quot;difficulties&quot;. I was on the depo shot for 2+ years and my periods had gone away. I&#039;ve had light bleeding with the Skyla and was told this was normal. I&#039;ve only been on it for a little over a month now but I&#039;ve noticed that past few weeks I have been SUPER hungry. I&#039;m not sure if this is because my &quot;periods&quot; are coming back or what, but I&#039;m hoping this goes away.""",8
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;d give 10 stars, but after 5 yrs on this med I feel as I&#039;m becoming dependent and immune at the same time. I take 400mg/daily and if I miss a dose by1 hr I get a horrible headache. Meanwhile for the past yr I feel as if I need to bump up the doses.  My psychiatrist said that 400mg is a very high dose and she&#039;s not comfortable exceeding. I take the dissolving tablets, which I found is a slow release and I&#039;m able to get thru my day more easily.  Also, because this is a brand name, is very hard to find it in stock! 
I definitely would recommend this drug, after trying numerous, this was the one that controlled my mood swings without side effects.""",6
Atralin,Acne,"""I am 27 and have always suffered from acne. I tried everything and was always disappointed as my breakouts continued. After a short stint with Spironolactone, my dermatologist said she wanted me on a topical and introduced me to Atralin. It took my skin a few weeks to get used to and probably 2 months for my breakouts to completely clear up. I haven&#039;t had a pimple in months. I finally feel comfortable enough to wear my hair up in public and can even go with no makeup. Great skin can really change your life!""",4
Effexor,Depression,"""I had tried a number of different prescription meds before Effexor, none of which seemed to help.  I can honestly say this worked the best, and with it I was able to get out of bed and begin to function again.  It really was one of those medications that did exactly what it was supposed to. I continued to take Effexor for three years, after which time I wanted to stop taking it and begin to manage my life without medicines.  This is when the problems began.  I can honestly say that it took me almost nine months to wean myself off Effexor.  I no longer have to take medication but would warn anyone being prescribed this that it is not an easy medicine to stop taking.""",5
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been taking lamictal for three years.  I never felt it worked in the first place, but the docs kept increasing the dose because it was not working.  After being on 200 mg for about 9 months, I&#039;ve decided that it was not worth taking a pill that does absolutely nothing for me.  I still get severely depressed.  I&#039;ve tried most drugs out there and am running out of options, but this is not one of them""",6
Minocycline,Acne,"""1 week After I delivered, I started to get cystic acne on my chin and jawline and cheek, nose, and even behind my ears. I know the cause...hormones of course! I tried so many prescription creams and over the counter acne cleans with no relief at all. Too depressing and embarrassing and I am not a big fan if foundation and facial cover ups. I was suggested Accutane but no, too many acute side effects. I tried minocycline 100 twice daily for 4 months. No side effects, got rid of all the acne and I had clear skin. The only thing I did not like is that such method of acne treatment took a long time (4 months is a long time for me) to work. Plus I was taking birth control so not really sure which helped me but the combo with the Epiduo cream at night helped!""",4
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I am 5&#039;4&quot; and started at 253. I stared Saxenda this past Tuesday. Still at the 0.6mg dose and this morning down to 246. Now i know darn well that that is probably a combo of water weight and just not. being. hungry.! I&#039;ve had a little nausea but that seems to go away by mid morning. Overall, i feel pretty good and whatever the action on the brain that this stuff is, I like it. I don&#039;t feel hungry and i have energy. Since i am seeing some reasonable results, I am not getting discouraged! I paid for this out of pocket for the first month, just to see if it would work. If you can get past the price tag (which is rather obscene and the only reason I did not rate a 10) this is definitely worth a try.""",2
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""Started on celexa 8 yrs ago.  It was tremendously successful at 60mg, so much so that I nicknamed it routine Xanax.  Then FDA directed lower dose to 40mg for senior citizens due to small possibility of dropping dead from altered heart rhythm.  So my shrink and I tried Zoloft(I felt zombified).  Lost two Drs. cause they transferred to different departments, then we tried adding wellbutrin to cover the side effects, but that simulated taking a strong stimulant, shakey and anxious.  Was was then carefully switched to effexor  SR.  Once completely off the wellbutrin and Zoloft, and taking Effexor  SR caps 150mg, I&#039;m now, after a few days, approaching benefits of celexa, with side effects decreasing or gone.  Will ask for 1 more slight dose increase.""",5
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Recommended by my endocrinologist, he gave me 3 pens as samples. Just started my third week into the liraglutide injections, had my first 1.8 last night. I&#039;m still experiencing a lot of cravings, and constant-ish hunger. My portions are smaller, not because I can&#039;t eat more, but because I choose to make smaller plates. So far I&#039;ve lost 6 pounds since October 7th (to October 22nd). I&#039;m not really feeling the weight loss, or many side effects (mild nausea very infrequently, and some constipation). Hoping the higher doses have a better effect.""",2
Copper,Birth Control,"""Do not get this! I got these in 2008 after the birth of my daughter. From the beginning I had heavier periods and cramping so bad I couldn&#039;t get out of bed for at least a day. I got to where I was bleeding constantly for a month or two at a time. I ended up having it surgically removed in 2013 because it shifted and stuck through my uterine wall. I have been TTC since then. Now instead of always having a period, I will go  months without one and still have not been able to carry full term (2 miscarriages).""",8
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I am 52 years old, 5&#039;5 and weighed 183 pounds.  Keeping my old eating habits and staying sedentary expecting this med to work netted a 5 lb loss over 3 months.  So I quit.  I restarted after a 6 month break with a new food &amp; exercise plan.  My weight is falling off this time!  My learning is that this med is exponentially more effective if I take responsibility for getting off the sofa and spending more time &amp; money in the produce dept.   I&#039;m down 10 lbs in the first 2 weeks back on it. I&#039;ve found some great recipes for vegetables I never thought I&#039;d eat.  My appetite us suppressed enough that I&#039;m perfectly satisfied with a 5 oz steak instead of my normal 16 oz.  I recommend Belviq but only as a supplement to healthier eating and exercise.""",3
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I went on Doryx about 2 weeks ago and I&#039;ve already seen a huge improvement. At first I thought the pills were really big, but they&#039;re not that bad at all (don&#039;t make it a bigger deal than it is!). You can take it at any time of day and watching the progress of your skin getting clearer is so awesome. I used this product with Differin and a prescribed face wash. I don&#039;t know if it will work for everyone but I do know it did for me. I didn&#039;t have much trouble getting a lot of acne so far. I think it just doesn&#039;t happen for some people. I&#039;m seeing improvement right away. 

RECOMMENDED!""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I was put on this birth control because the depshot caused heavy nonstop period and now that I have been on the nexplanon I have had on and off periods starting with it going for 2 months to stoping for 3months and put on weight and have now got gallstones from it hoping for my doctor to remove it every time I ask her to take it out and I tell her it&#039;s not working she won&#039;t do anything about it""",8
Dapsone,Acne,"""Worked great in the beginning for a month or so, but that was about it.  Even with my excellent insurance, this wasn&#039;t covered, but I was given a coupon which made it FREE. If not, it would&#039;ve been in the $300 range.
That aside, I used all the samples I got and I saw some results, so I filled the prescription. Long story short, I saw no lasting effects. The good about this, there was no burning, peeling, etc. Out of all the acne creams I used, which is a lot over the course of 10-15 years, tazoratene worked best.""",4
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""By far the best sleep medication I&#039;ve ever taken.  I take 400-500 mg approximately 2 hours before bed.  It&#039;s a very deep, restful sleep.

I was very scared to take this because I&#039;ve had bad reactions to a few other medications.  I took Remeron for sleep, and that would give me a very strange head the next day.  I remember I used to have a lot of false awakenings on that stuff.  Trazodone was similar -- I used to feel utterly horrible the next day.

Seroquel is good.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am 18, and alongside my ADD, I suffer from major depression disorder, objective defiant disorder, and major case anxiety. After an emotional breakdown on a school trip, my doctor started me back on my Zoloft and once I got that stabilized he started me on Vyvanse. We started at 40 and that worked while I was taking my Zoloft at night, but when I moved it to the morning, we had to up the dose to 60mg. I have experienced nausea, dizziness, increasing perspiration, and a little insomnia, but they don&#039;t last too long. I have also been struggling with weight pretty much my whole life. I started on May 2nd and I have lost a little over 20lbs.""",1
Bupropion,Depression,"""Over years have tried several antidepressants.....in my younger years Prozac, zoloft, Paxil, horrible side effects! Now that I am in my fifties I have been dealing  with depression? Menopausal related,stress ,life.....tried natural Sam e  and some others with no results but only side effects....Finally started Wellbutin and finally feeling black cloud lifting with No weird side effects....Hopefully continue and feel like my old self again:)""",5
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication saved my life! I had severe depression since the age of 12. I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta, Celexa, Zoloft etc. Nothing worked. Was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. On several occasions tried to take my own life. The last time I nearly succeeded, was on a 72 hour hold. The Dr. proscribed Lamictal at a low dose of 25mg. Gradually increased in increments of 25mg. I&#039;m now taking 150mg. at bedtime and I no longer have thoughts of suicide, hopelessness or despair. I&#039;ve been taking Lamictal for 2yrs. now, and I can honestly say that I enjoy life for the first time. Don&#039;t give up on this medication as it takes time to work. For me, it was about 2 months. I didn&#039;t have any side effects, but everyone is different. Good luck and God Bless!""",6
Fentanyl,Pain,"""Very effective for pain. Have been pain meds for 11 yrs. Tried many others ie. hydrocodone, morphine, Percocet, oxymorphone, several others, but nothing worked like fentanyl. However, I have had some serious side effects. First I froze at 78 degrees inside our home in southwest florida. Then my left eye started getting really hazy. I thought my glasses were filthy. By the way it&#039;s still hazy after going through almost four months of withdrawal.  Then my right leg felt like dead weight at night. My left leg felt like it was wrapped with a very tight sock from below the knee to my ankle. I felt like I was going to vomit any minute, my mouth started to get watery. My gut hurt like anything. """,9
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""This is the only med that actually helps me sleep. I had tried melatonin, zopiclone, lorazepam and temazepam, as well as every natural remedy I could get my hands on and then my doctor suggested quetiapine. I take 25mg about an hour before going to sleep and usually by the time I climb into bed I can hardly keep my eyes open. I&#039;m also taking bupropion (which is technically contraindicated with quetiapine) which may be why I feel so sedated on such a low dose. The only downside is that I don&#039;t fully wake up from it until I&#039;ve been physically awake for at least an hour and it makes me really thirsty. But that&#039;s a small price to pay for getting a good sleep after struggling for years. Also it makes orgasms less intense for me which sucks!""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""It&#039;s May 13 the 2017 I&#039;m in my second week of contrave, so I now take 2 pills a day I go to 3 pills for week 3.  I am a 53 yr old male, I started with a weight of 276 after 2 full weeks I&#039;m at 266. The scaledown program is absolutely great. I weigh every morning the scale sends a cellular signal through my phone to scaledown, they then send me a text to monitor my progress. They give me advise and encouragement. Really beneficial. I sure hope this continues to work for me, I&#039;m really tired of hearing the words morbidly obese!! Only downside is occasionally feeling nauseated, dizzy, mild headaches, but nothing I can&#039;t tolerate. And of course the cost, since my insurance Will not cover the medication my cost is $90 for a month supply.""",2
Vraylar,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have tried Abilify, Seroquel, and Saphris and this is by far the best medication I&#039;ve been on. I did have a good experience with Seroquel until I got sick, but I would sleep through a hurricane which was bad for my work. I went two years after I got sick not feeling like myself. TWO YEARS. No real joy, no passion, no libido, nothing. Also my anxiety was out of control and I was beginning to use a lot of Ativan. Then, my psychiatrist was unavailable so I saw his PA and he put me on Vraylar. I don&#039;t know if this is even possible but I swear I began to feel better in a matter of days. It was incredible. My anxiety was the first symptom I noticed began to improve, then I started to notice the &quot;pep in my step&quot; improve. I&#039;m happy again!""",6
Minocycline,Acne,"""I started taking this medication for a scalp infection/acne about a week ago. At 1st my scalp seemed to clear up overnight and I was so excited and my acne is feeling better too. However after a week the side effects kicked in and I am sick to my stomach all the time, it&#039;s weird, I have this full feeling in my stomach like I am full of liquid and the medication is floating on top near my throat. I am hoping it will go away...""",4
Skyla,Birth Control,"""Got it 3.5 months ago. First 3 periods were 2 weeks long (which freaked me out) but this past one was pleasantly brief--just 4 days and way lighter generally. I was also really worried at first because the period pain seemed more intense at first than before the IUD (and that&#039;s the reason why I got it in the first place), but that too has subsided. They say to give it a few months and let your body get used it...that is true. I suspect by month #6 things will be even better.""",8
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I was prescribed 50mg of Spiro a day with topical Tretinoin Gel (19 year old female here). I started noticing improvement in my acne after I introduced that topical gel into the equation (so I imagine that the topical caused most of the improvement). Two weeks after starting Spiro, I started noticing hair all over the sink and a ton in the shower drain. I experienced tightening of the throat on and off after a week (a subtle annoyance, not super severe) and didn&#039;t attribute it to the Spiro, but eventually I realized my voice sounded very deep, unacceptable as I&#039;m a singer. I had no idea this was a side effect until I looked up Spiro side effects and it explained everything. I stopped taking it after this and won&#039;t go back at this dosage.""",4
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""About 3 years ago I was on Lexapro 10mg, then I was off. Then about 9 months ago I was on Lexapro 10mg again then up to 20mg but my libido pretty much became non existent. I had weight gain, I tried working out but it didn&#039;t help the problem. It worked with my anxiety but after a while I felt like it was wearing off and I was becoming accustomed. I had lost my job and had no insurance so I couldn&#039;t afford my Lexapro, so I was cut off up until about 3 days ago. The withdrawals were INSANE, I had so many attacks and brain zaps I really wanted to crash my car into incoming traffic, I would have my mom come pick me up while I would park on the side of the road.""",7
Vraylar,Bipolar Disorde,"""Vraylar saved my life. I was diagnosed bipolar in my early 20&#039;s. I went through a 5 year stint of hard drugs nearly killing myself. After getting sober in 2010, I  took Depacot (made me gain a ton of weight) Lithium ( gave me intense tremors and I was always thirsty). So, I decided to go off meds. Relapsed on alcohol. Found myself in the hospital within a month for trying to commit suicide. I went to a partial hospitalization program where the psych Dr prescribed me Vraylar. I swear within 3 days, I was a new person. I had tons of energy, I was happy, and it&#039;s only been a week I am still only on the 1.5 dose. I am so thankful for this drug. I am usually extremely sensitive to psych meds and have experience no side affects.""",6
Accutane,Acne,"""So I&#039;ve been off accutane now for 4-5 months. My skin is still amazing. I had awful scaring and spots on my arms back chest and face before, my skin is now flawless. My Dermotologist said that once I stopped accutane My face would get inflamed however it didn&#039;t. I only get few spots now, only on my face which is great. I&#039;ve become less paranoid about my body and face. I strongly suggest accutane. All the side effects are worth it. I suffered from awful anxiety which accutane has resolved for me. I feel so happy!""",4
Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been taking Klonopin, on and off, for almost ten years now. There are so many varieties that I don&#039;t know which ones work for me anymore. The doctors all tell you it&#039;s the same thing. If that&#039;s the case, why have I stopped and started so many times? The most common reason is tolerance, i suspect. However, it has been my observation over the last 10 or so years, that the different colors, sources, and whatever &quot;fillers&quot; that are in some of these clonazepam, alter the effects too randomly. As sufferers of the horribly misunderstood disorder, we should have more resources to find out what is in these and  more insight into which ones favor our individual bipolar characteristics.""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got liletta in August, so it&rsquo;s been about three months. The insertion was terrible, I nearly passed out and had to lay and regain my strength for about fifteen minutes afterwards. And the cramps after inserting and for the next couple of days were excruciating. After 2 days my cramps did stop and I felt okay. My periods have been spotty and irregular and last about 10 days, but this month I haven&rsquo;t had one at all so far so I&rsquo;m hoping they stop all together. Only symptom I have from it now is pretty painful cramps but it&rsquo;s nothing a painkiller can&rsquo;t relieve.""",8
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I started Adipex 37.5 a week ago today 04-07-2016 and I have gained 3 pounds??? I don&#039;t understand why it&#039;s not working I&#039;m using my fitness pal to help track my meals but the most I get out of these is a headache and I&#039;m very moody. I called my doctor but today is Saturday to see why I haven&#039;t been so successful as the others that I have been reading about my start date was 268.5 when I weighed myself today and 272 I&#039;m so disappointed I paid $100 for the pills in Detroit, Michigan and my repeat visits are $75.
I am not hungry but very gasy. I eat 3 meals per day and have not worked out yet.""",2
Concerta,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve been taking Concerta for nearly five years now and just recently it hasn&#039;t been working as well as it used to. I was diagnosed with ADD in 6th grade and was then prescribed this medication. I&#039;ve been taking it ever since. But back in May, I started to notice that I was having a much harder time focusing. It was almost like I hadn&#039;t taken it at all. This was very unfortunate since at that time I was having my end of year exams. I&#039;ve also seen that others have been having the same problem. I&#039;m looking forward to having this sorted out because my ADD is very bad and makes it very hard just to function in everyday life.""",1
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking it for about 3 months now, and it works very well. I do not have those strong unrealistic negative scenarios anymore, no voices, no feeling like disappearing, all that is gone, and it minimized my unreasonable fears. I do have long moments of almost total lack of emotions, and I do not feel much in general (I used to be an enthusiastic person) but I do not mind for now, it was terrible not to be able to control inexplicable feelings. I did not gain weight (just a bit, but I also take Wellbutrin). My only concern is how I am going to be when I stop taking this medicine.""",6
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I took Neurontin (Gabapentin) for three months as a treatment for chronic pain following a herniated lumbar disc a year and a half ago.  Anti-inflammatories and other medicines such as Oxycodone, Tramadol, etc. had minimal effect.

After increasing my dosage over the course of three weeks, Neurontin completely eliminated the pain.  However, I gained weight rapidly (nearly 20 pounds in 2 months), retained a tremendous amount of water, to the point where my jewelry wouldn&#039;t fit and my shoes were very tight, and the constipation was awful and even laxatives didn&#039;t help.  Also, I was fatigued all the time.  Unfortunately, the side effects were just too much for me.  I still haven&#039;t found a good replacement medicine for the pain.  All the side effects!""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started taking Contrave the 3rd week of January, at first I did feel a little nauseous and light headed, but I drank lots of water and didn&#039;t take the pills on an empty stomach and those side effects went away after 3 days. The only side effects I am still experiencing are trouble sleeping if I take the second dose too late in the day and I can&#039;t stop clenching my jaw. However, I have lost 11 pounds! I also struggle with depression and I have tried all kinds of meds for it and NOTHING has made me feel as good as this medication does. I feel like I can enjoy my life. I rarely think about food unless my stomach growls and I can resist comfort foods and make better choices. I hope it continues to work this well.""",2
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I am a 52 year old male, an RN, weighed in at 330 lbs prior to starting this medication.  Poor diet, I could never get &quot;full&quot;.  I snacked between snacks, ate high carbs and fat.  I was taking BP med and low dose SSRI, Lexapro 5mg daily for social anxiety.  I started Belviq 10mg 2/9/15.  I also started a diet consisting of 800 calories/day.  I have eliminated all dairy and processed carbs, no bread, no pasta, no cereal, nothing.  I also minimize my fat intake. An apple and coffee for breakfast, a chik breast, apple and salad for lunch and dinner. My snack is 1 cup nonfat cottage cheese.  25 days later, I have lost 25 lbs, am rarely hungry, and feel GREAT with no side effects. Wait till I start exercising! This med is a true lifesaver!""",2
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I had a 23 week gestational premature baby. I was on severe bed rest with an existing compressed disk. My L5 ripped/ruptured and leaks fluid. The surgery to get my daughter out was very invasive and they gave me a spinal tap in my C7/8. They hit a nerve big time. So I am in constant pain. My daughter is fine now. However, I too take pain medicine, which I prefer not to. Vicodin, Norco, Percocet, tramadol and now Gabapentin. Which really works! Very well. Helps the anxiety pain puts you through. Helps withdrawal from pain meds. At first it gets you loopy but your body begins to adapt. But its worth not being on a narcotic for years.

Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My 8 year old daughter has been taking the medication for 4 months now and although we have seen a good improvement in her behavior, the weight gain has been substantial.  She has gained over 10 lbs in 4 months which is incredibly unhealthy. Her blood pressure has also been on the very low side.  Unfortunately for us we can&#039;t risk the bad side effects even though we have seen a positive behavior change.""",1
Etodolac,Pain,"""This drug is a lesser known gem.  I had taken various other NSAIDS and Narcotics and Etodolac is the only drug I have stayed with since IT WORKS.  No real side effects that I am aware of.  AND it is inexpensive.  I have degenerative discs, spinal stenosis and arthritis.  My back pain is constant without taking this drug.  While taking this, my pain levels are drastically reduced and I am way more functional.  I convinced two other family members to talk to their doctor about Etodolac and they too have had great results.  This is a no brainer to highly recommend.""",9
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I&#039;ve only been on it for a couple months but it seems to have kicked in. I distinctly remember the moment I felt it; it was a sort of euphoria that felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. After that, it definitely died down. It has helped with anxiety and agitation, but I don&#039;t feel like it has been doing anything in the way of depression. It&#039;s also flattened me out quite a bit in lieu of helping me feel more balanced. I&#039;m going to wait a little longer and then probably try something else.""",5
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I am 25 years old. Just started taking loestrin 24fe. Took it a week before my peroid. It&#039;s been two weeks since then. No period yet. Haven&#039;t done the deed yet so I dont know how effective it is. Started taking it due to being married soon (next week in fact). 
The problem Is I&#039;m having shortness of breath and pain in my knee (thought it was pain due to walking home from work everyday, now not so sure. Could be a possible blood clot. My calf is hurting as well. I&#039;m going to continue to take my pills but have compression socks on from now on to limit the clots if I have any.
I&#039;m healthy (except I have synthyroid) only 25, so I shouldn&#039;t be having problems like this right? I&#039;m keeping my legs over my heart as instructed to lessen the pain.""",8
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve only JUST started taking trazodone for Insomnia - so I honestly can&#039;t give a fair rating just yet...it&#039;s only been one week - but I have a question for those on it. The first week my doctor said to take 50 mg. My sleep was pretty good - only woke up once a night (usually around 4:30 am). I upped it to 75mg and then 100 mg (as instructed by the doctor)...the last two nights that I&#039;ve been on the 100 mg dose, I&#039;ve woken up 4 - 5 times / night. Anyone find that the higher the dose the LESS sleep they get? I liked the sleep I got last week on the 50mg dose but want to keep going with the 100 as per doc&#039;s orders but anyone here notice that the higher the dosage the LESS sleep?""",0
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lithium provides a ton of stability for ultra-rapid cyclers.  The drawbacks are it interacts with almost everything in certain ways and it is fairly hard on the liver.  My primary care physician and psychiatrist work together to try to provide options that won&#039;t affect my liver as much as a result.  Because of the amount of stability it provides, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be able to go off of it.  I may be able to lower it by trying changes to other things.  But it just works too well at giving stability.  I don&#039;t like when the pharmacist says it out loud because it&#039;s a dead giveaway of what you&#039;re taking it for.  """,6
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I have used Lunesta for five years now, and I am so glad. I have been a chronic insomniac for the entire time due to anxiety and depression from my husband&#039;s long illness and death (PTSS), and Post Menopausal Syndrome that hit the same time my husband died. Just ghastly. Most physical and mental symptoms are gone now, but I still can not sleep or rest without this pill and I have tried and still do practice all the recommended actions (like a cool room; don&#039;t eat after five in the afternoon, etc.). If your stomach is even half full at bedtime, it does not work nearly as well. I do not experience any adverse physical or mental symptoms, including any bad taste using this medication. Getting enough rest is so important to me.""",0
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I got switched to this because I get auras with my migraines.  It gave me menstrual migraines, and periods every other week. My periods were heavier, longer and a lot more painful.  I don&#039;t really have PMS, but on this drug, I get mood swings, painful constipation, acne and a sore genital tract.  The menstrual migraines went away after three months, the first month the period pain went away.  
Over the course of 18 months, my vaginal discharge disappeared.  It made sex so painful that it&#039;s impossible.  It also cause stress incontinence.  I&#039;ve been off it for six months and the lack of discharge still a problem because I&#039;m apparently not allowed to have any type of estrogen.""",8
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""Diagnosed with general anxiety disorder.  Would have obsessive thoughts non stop, losing sleep sometimes.  Started taking buspar 5mg twice a day.  Hands felt tingling and head a little cloudy but no other real side affect.  Increased up to 10mg.  Immediately saw improvement, no more obsessive thoughts that would normally slow me at my work.  Been on it for almost a year now and have no side affects.""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""DON&#039;T BE PUT OFF BY A BAD REVIEW! I took Accutane when I was 18, I held off taking it for a while as of all of the reviews. Me and my friend were both on it, she suffered with the dry skin and nose bleeds but its no where near as bad as it sounds. I never even noticed her dry skin and if you&#039;re good and slap moisturizer on you&#039;ll be fine! I threatened about the dry skin and I tell you I didn&#039;t have one side effect I just remember loving life! No more make up sliding off my face due to oiliness either. The side effects depend on your dose I was on 30mg but my friend was on 80mg and had side effects. You can take a lower dose but you&#039;ll be on the treatment for longer as you&#039;re given a certain amount depending on your weight.""",4
Diphenhydramine,Insomnia,"""I took this as a sleeping aid due to a very hectic schedule that was stressing me out. It did help me go to sleep and stay asleep but I noticed that I was somewhat dizzy at times during the day. Over a six week period the dizziness became worse. I went to an ENT thinking perhaps I had an ear infection that was messing up my balance. He told me to discontinue the diphenhydramine and try valerian root (I didn&#039;t want to use any more drugs) and it would take time for the drug to get out of my system. I&#039;ve been off the med for a week and still have some dizziness going on. This drug is definitely not for continuous use!""",0
Belviq,Obesity,"""The good:  I&#039;ve been taking Belviq for two weeks.  I have had a significant decrease in appetite &amp; desire to eat.  Even when I am hungry, I&#039;m really not interested in food.  I get up to find something to snack on, but find myself walking away because nothing looks good to eat.  I&#039;ve had a 7 pound weight loss, so I would call this a success.

The bad:  I have definitely noticed the fatigue, all day long.  My mood is pretty flat all of the time.  Not happy, not sad, just flat.  I have been dizzy, at times to the point of needing to sit down.  I also notice difficulty keeping my eyes focused on the screen.  Like my eyes are drifting without my being able to control it.  I&#039;m thinking about stopping or lowering dose.""",2
Adapalene,Acne,"""I tried this medication when I was a teenager but did not stick with it because the irritation it caused me was unbearable. I wonder if it because my acne was worse and my skin more sensitive at the time but I can&#039;t remember how long I stuck with it. I started my current try with it about nine moths ago. I had about one-two months of redness, itchiness and a lot of skin flaking but as soon as this wore off (which it did completely) as my skin adapted to it, I started noticed big improvements:
I have had almost no blackheads which were causing me lot of scarring.
For most of the month I get no spots and when I do, it&#039;s just a few and they are MUCH smaller, less painful and disappear quicker and my skin overall looks clearer and more youthful""",4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started Adipex on August 2.  I had my second (and last) baby almost 3 months ago.  I have an extra 25 pounds of baby weight on top of being 240 when I got pregnant.  I need to get the weight off as I am pre-diabetic. I am doing a 1500 calorie diet along with the pill.  I cut out all white bread, white sugar, white rice, etc.  I also cut out pop (even though I was only drinking diet pop).  I was down 7 pounds as of yesterday.  I hope to be down 10 pounds total by the end of this week.  I haven&#039;t started exercising as pregnancy also brought along plantar fasciitis.  As soon as my feet get better, I will be hopping on the treadmill.  I don&#039;t notice much more energy, just seem more awake. I still get hungry, it just takes a little longer.""",3
Vilazodone,Depression,"""This medicine increased my mood within a matter of days. However, when I increased my dosage from 10 mg to 20 mg in the start pack, I got violently sick, nausea then extreme vomiting with a headache. Worse than any hangover that I have ever had. The problems lasted for 2 days and eventually diminished to a headache. When I started taking the medication I notice that a numbness in my arms and shoulders at night and stiff joints in the morning. When I stopped the medicine the muscle stiffness and joints decreased. I was on the medicine for almost a month and still have the stiff joints and muscle aches.  I was an endurance athlete and this type of pain was different.""",5
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I have suffered from moderate to severe acne. My doctor prescribed me this medication the first week of July 2015. I literally saw NO results until after 4 weeks. I told my dermatologist that it doesn&#039;t look like it really works for me BUT, he told me It usually takes 3-4 months to really see the improvement. Also, a week after I saw him I did see a HUGE improvement. I had a lot of bumps on my forehead and all around my chin. My face is very smooth now, just have a couple of scars. Nothing good makeup can&#039;t hide when I have to head out. I also avoid the sun as much as I can. Bc I started to notice my skin was getting flakey but I use a good moisturizer to get rid of that. I take one when I wake up and one before I go to bed.""",4
Bactrim,Acne,"""I have horrible hormonal acne and Bactrim has been the only systemic drug that has helped. Problem is I took it for years, randomly when needed.  After years of usage, oddly I became allergic to it.  I broke out in large red spots that were extremely sensitive.  It&#039;s a serious allergy. I have permanent dark bruises all over my body and it has been years since I&#039;ve used it.  If you haven&#039;t tried Bactrim.  Try it. It will work for you.""",4
Hydrocodone,Pain,"""This drug didn&#039;t work as well as short-acting hydrocodone in lower doses. I had to take up to 20 mg of Tramadol per day for breakthrough pain on top of the 30 mg of Hysingla. It put me to sleep, made me unable to think clearly or efficiently, and didn&#039;t allow me to organize my day or complete my tasks as well as I previously had. I had to take it around 6 PM to avoid breathing issues when I laid down and as a result, by the time I got up in the morning I no longer received any pain relief from it - there is no way it works for 24 hours. I&#039;m now in the process of returning to Norco and while still taking hydrocodone am experiencing withdrawal symptoms from getting off the Hysingla. It is far more dangerous and addictive than it is promoted.""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I just got my Skyla inserted yesterday, and I, like most girls, psyched myself out beforehand by reading a ton of horrible stories about it. I went in with a bad mindset. I also got scheduled to have it inserted on the first day of my period, which is not what I wanted to do. They recommend insertion during your period, but usually not the first day. So I had absolutely terrible cramps to begin with. I have to say, the insertion process was definitely the worst pain I&#039;ve ever experienced in my entire life. I&#039;m 21, no children, and have been on the pill since I was about 18. If I could suggest anything, don&#039;t have it inserted on the first day of your period, if you have terrible cramps like I do. I got terribly sick and almost passed out.""",8
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""As of May 2015 i gave myself one year to lose the weight. I got up to 212( im 5&#039;8) so i carried it pretty well but i was not happy the way i felt, always tired, clothes not fitting. i was comfortable when i was 175-180. So after a whole year and Nothing on the scale changed, i went to my Dr and had blood work done hoping to find a reason WHY, blood work came back all good and clear. Noone likes Bad news but at the moment i was hoping to be given a reason i wasnt losing...what was i doing so wrong! He told me to try BELVIQ 2x a day. So here i am started 18 days ago n im down to 200.i had a slight headache for the 1st 3 days and now normal, i dont have the feeling to snack or over eat. Walk 2 miles 3x week too. Good luck!!!""",3
Accutane,Acne,"""If your face doesn&#039;t respond to over the counter products, you don&#039;t need to try everything out there.  ProActiv, SkinID, OXY, they are all the same!  Don&#039;t hesitate to try this miracle drug.  Pay attention to the side effects, of course, but this is not just a treatment, it is a cure.  I had severe acne from 16 - 20 and I tried everything!  Doctors were so reluctant to use this Accutane, keeping it as a last resort.  Once they were finally convinced I wasn&#039;t responding to anything else, and that I wouldn&#039;t just outgrow it, they finally put me on it, and the results were dramatic.  Within weeks, I could actually feel the change in my skin.  My skin finally felt normal, instead of greasy and painful.  I wasn&#039;t afraid to touch it anymore.""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""I want to qualify my comments by disclosing I have only been on Contrave for a week. My intention is to comment periodically as I am on the med longer.

I was very nervous about starting Contrave given what I had read about the side effects. I don%u2019t take meds very often, and I didn&#039;t like the idea of going on a recurring and long term pill. That being said, the first week on Contrave has been incredible. I will say I was food obsessed before. Thoughts of food ran through my head throughout the day, and the idea of eating was always there.

I had no idea how much mental energy I had been spending pushing those thoughts aside. Now, with Contrave, my head is clear. I no longer sit at my desk and watch the clock, waiting until it%u2019s a reasonable time to eat, or force myself to push on another hour before ultimately giving in and getting a snack.

When I do eat %u2013 and yes, I still very much enjoy the taste of food %u2013 I don%u2019t feel that same sense of urgency and elation I use to. Those feelings would often trigger binge eating.

I look forward to seeing what my future with Contrave holds, and more importantly, I am hopeful.

Again, for full disclosure%u2026 I did have mild nausea the first day I took the pill, but it was short lived, and has not recurred in subsequent days.""",2
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve suffered with insomnia for many years &amp; have tried various remedies including Yoga based approaches &amp; treatments using natural products like Valerian. Unfortunately, none of these has had any lasting effect. 
Usually, I will manage to get to sleep but will wake up three or four hours later &amp; then have a real struggle to get back to sleep no matter how relaxed I am. Consequently, I&#039;m absolutely shattered the next day and find it very hard to function properly. With Doxylamine, however, I usually enjoy a good night&#039;s sleep (6 to 7 hours) and feel energised the next day. I&#039;ve been taking them for over three years now and don&#039;t appear to have any side effects. I take about half a tablet each night and drift of to sleep about an hour later""",0
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I have been on ambien for years. At one period of time, not living in this country I was prescribed 20 mls a night. Back here in the US I have been put on 12.5 extended release. I usually take 1 and a half to get me to sleep with 2 phenergan. I crave sweet things after taking it. I run out Halfway through the month. I was getting a supply from India of 10mls too for 150 dollars but ran out of those this week. I was given to try Lunesta 3 mls I have been awake for hours after taking the Lunesta plus 2 phenergan and 300 mls of gabapentin. I have been to a sleep Center as well. They wanted to take me off all sleep meds except for Gabapentin and gave me A sleep machine. Totally useless, a lot of money. Ambien for me are way better than anything""",0
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I am a disabled veteran with severe headaches due to trauma from a combat injury.  Thankfully I am able to live a fully functional life because of this drug.  You&#039;d think people, especially doctors, would be more sympathetic to our returning veterans.  I have a steady job, a wonderful wife, and still when I was first being seen by doctors, they treated me like I was some pill-seeking addict.  Thankfully, I was able to get into a pain management program at the VA and have a wonderful, understanding doctor.  I take 5mg Oxycodone 4 times a day, and it has changed my life. It amazes me how paranoid medical professionals have become.""",9
Hexachlorophene,Acne,"""I used hexachlorophene before it was taken off the market.  I used it once and it burned my face so badly I had to see a dermatologist for months and repeatedly have my face scraped   and wrapped like a mummy. I wasn&#039;t the only one in my family to use it. Three of us used it at the same time. We all had a chemical burn but mine was worse because  my skin was much  lighter. The company then came out with Phiso-Hex. I  never used it, but I would suggest to use extreme caution or better yet find something without hexachlorophene in it.""",4
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m going into my second month using Trileptal and started at 600 mg a day.  My Dr just upped it to 900mg because it wasn&#039;t stabilizing my moods as much as I would like.  I also take Klonopin for anxiety and the Trileptal for my bipolar.  So far, no side effects like the Topamax with tingling but I&#039;m hoping it starts working better.  My Dr wants to throw in an antidepressant along with something for ADHD but wants to wait till this kicks in.  """,6
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""I have aspergers and ADD and started taking strattera when I was about 9 or 10. And in just two months I lost over 20 kg (44 pounds) I was so skinny but I didn&#039;t change because I had tried everything else and this was the smallest side effects I had so far. But after I quit just over a month ago (I&#039;m 17 now) I realized that the medication had caused me to have severe depression for all my childhood, I&#039;m really happy for the first time in forever. and the medication had made me more angry and restless than when not taking them.""",1
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I took it like I was supposed to for anxiety and panic disorder. it did nothing absolutely nothing. I&#039;m in worse shape now than I ever was. doctors please get a grip you can&#039;t treat us for just anything it&#039;s like trying to treat athletes feet with dandruff shampoo .We are people we know that you&#039;re not supposed to get attached to it.  the medicine sucks doesn&#039;t help sleep doesn&#039;t help panic disorder doesn&#039;t help insomnia doesn&#039;t help anxiety. I&#039;m not sneezing -  I didn&#039;t go in for an antihistamine.  Do you think that Google won&#039;t tell us everything. It didn&#039;t take long to figure out I mean nothing. write a  proper prescription""",7
Dilaudid,Pain,"""Went to the ER because of sciatic nerve pressure for severe pain and multiple muscles spasms that would not stop. 2 injections of dilaudid had no effect at all. Tried some 4mg oral dilaudid tablets and no effect at all. This is most likely a very effective pain reliever but this indicates that not all pain relievers work on me. Doctors don&#039;t believe me so I almost always refuse to take any pain medication. I think I need to be studied.""",9
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My son is 6 they started him off on Concerta he seemed fine we had minimal complaint the only downside is everyday around 7 he would be in moods over silly things, but it would pass. Now the Vayvanse had him in &quot;HULK&quot; mode as he would describe it. He was very snappy and angry and became aggressive with the kids at school, (which was never an issue before). I hated that stuffed. I&#039;m beginning to realize that finding the right meds is going to be a HUGE task.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I used to have moderate cystic acne - down my back, on my arms and of course all over my face. It was my greatest insecurity and the cause for my low self esteem. I would simply refuse to go outside without wearing layers of makeup first and would constantly pop my pimples in order to flatten them out and attempt to conceal them better with makeup- stupid, I know .
I have Accutane to thank for changing this about me. It has been my messiah. I won&#039;t claim to have picture perfect skin but after 8 months on this drug my skin is nothing like it used to be. Nowadays I don&#039;t wake up and pat my face for new breakouts , first thing in the morning filled with dread. 

Of course it is important to take this drug responsibly and keep your Derm informed""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the implanon inserted in June 2014, it was amazing for about 16 months.. no period and no side effects! Then out of nowhere I started getting spotting and mood swings. It&#039;s now been 6 months and I&#039;m getting a period every 2 weeks and severe mood swings, I feel like I&#039;m losing my mind. I decided to wait and see if it improved but as it&#039;s now been 6 months, I&#039;m getting it removed this week.""",8
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""My husband has ADD, and it really took a toll on our relationship.  He was originally on Vyvanse, but it suppressed his appetite horribly.  It didn&#039;t do enough in ratio to the side effects, so he decided to try Strattera.

So far, it&#039;s been working decently.  His main problem, however, is being able to urinate freely.  I bought him Urinozinc Prostate Formula, and literally the first pill he took, he was able to urinate much more easily.  Conversely, when he forgot a pill the other day, he noticed an immediate difference, and struggled to urinate.  The supplement has allowed him to stay on Strattera.

I note this stuff, as I have read that this is a common issue for men taking Strattera.  Hope this helps others.""",1
Clindamycin,Acne,"""I began to use Clindamycin PH 1% Gel and Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% and Sulfur 5% towards the end of the summer for 2 months for my issues with acne on my chin. I had bumps on other areas of my face but mostly concentrated in my chin. My acne its not severe but its always been an issue, and since I was 12 I always had black heads on my nose and chin. This gel did not work for I didn&#039;t notice any change on my face, the pimples, bumps and black heads remained the same, they became more noticeable. It was irritating on my skin and it made my skin extremely oily and since I wear  makeup it became an issue. The cleanser I do enjoy, it clears your pores and my skin has never been softer but the gel I do not recommend""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been using phentermine to lose the remainder of my baby weight. It&#039;s been 2 weeks and I have lost 14lbs I do exercise and already eat right but after I lost the first 50lbs, I turned to this for a plateau breaker it broke my plateau and its helping me get back within navy standards with nothing to worry about. I recommend this to anyone who fully understands the effects of this controlled drug and has a very good understanding of healthy eating and the importance of exercise. Please note that this is a temporary medication - it is not meant to be used past a 12 week period during this time you are supposed to learn how to make healthier lifestyle choices. """,3
Azelaic acid,Acne,"""I&#039;m 22 years old and have some hormonal acne thats often cystic and painful. I went to the dermatologist and she recommended Finacea and doxycycline (for the first two months until Finacea became more effective) I didn&#039;t have horrible acne to begin with but it was just annoying huge ones that would spur up from time to time maybe two or three at a time. Once I started Finacea I got little pimples along with cystic ones on my jaw line and chin area (where I had them before) but now I was also getting pimples on my cheeks and forehead. I am wondering if Finacea makes acne worse before it gets better or if anyone else has found a solution for this/had this experience""",4
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this pill for almost two years and it has been great. No weight change. My breasts got really sore at first and gained a cup size, but that normalized. I did feel like I lost a lot of hair and my acne flares up once in awhile, but drinking a lot of water helps the acne. My period was twice a month at first, but now it is every six weeks and it lasts seven or eight days.  Kind of strange, but I&#039;ve gotten used to it.  My favorite part of this pill is that I haven&#039;t experienced pms that my husband nor I can remember. We used to get in monthly fights... I highly recommend this pill for someone that doesn&#039;t want to take estrogen. My mom has blood clotting issues, so this was one of the only options for me.""",8
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""This medicine has saved my life.  I was on it for several years (300 mg) and felt it wasn&#039;t helping any more so I quit it on my own.  No problem quitting but a few months ago began feeling hopeless due to financial problems and could not do anything on weekends but lay around in bed and sleep my weekends away.  I couldn&#039;t get anything done and put important things off that needed to be done.  In just the last 2 days I can tell that I already want to get out of bed and do housework and get a shower. I didn&#039;t realize what Wellbutrin XL did for me but I do now and am grateful I am back in it!""",5
Magnesium salicylate,Pain,"""I strongly recommend that everyone uses this product. I am a very skeptical person when it comes to putting anything in my body, which is why I am so paranoid when it comes to many products. DeWitt&#039;s Pain Reliever though is handled by a 100 year old company though and that gives me a sense of security. For the effectiveness of this product, I can&#039;t give it anything less than 5 out of 5 stars because it has become my new aspirin. I use it for headaches and soreness all the time!""",9
Clonidine,ADHD,"""My 6 yo tried this after Intuniv failed. It made him constantly tired and irritable, and actually made his impulsiveness worse since he just seemed cranky and emotional all of the time. It also constipated him to the point that ended up with fissures.

It never made a meaningful dent in his ability to concentrate or sit still, and he became more argumentative in school and less willing to comply.

I&#039;ve yet to meet anyone that these work for, but it sure would be nice if there were a non-stimulant that worked. We&#039;re on stimulants now and still haven&#039;t found a miracle there, either.

I will say that it didn&#039;t affect his appetite, which was nice.""",1
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""To be honest, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do if this drug didn&#039;t exist. Yeah, it&#039;s certainly got its risks, but if you&#039;ve got sleep onset insomnia and the trazodone, antihistamines, and everything else you&#039;ve tried has failed, don&#039;t be afraid to give Sonata a try. Even the smallest dose available helps me, which is kind of surprising, considering that doxylamine and hydroxyzine both crapped out after less than a month, trazodone barely did anything, and diphenhydramine always left me drowsy the next day and had a tendency to make me oversleep, not to mention that it takes 50 to 75mg combined with melatonin to do anything. Sonata works wonders for me. Just don&#039;t take it every night, since it can get less effective if you do.""",0
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I been on these medicine for a little over a month and I fell different.. a good different.  After dealing with PPD I was put on antidepressant medicines.

He takes .1 mg in the morning and we just increased evening to .2mg. The only trouble we&#039;ve had is sleep. He falls asleep but wakes up by 4am. And then, doesn&#039;t fall back to sleep until 6 but has to be awake by 7:30. So, right now, he&#039;s texting me to bring him coffee.

Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking this about five years ago for anxiety/OCD/extreme irritability (bipolar spectrum) and it is a great mood stabilizer. However, it seems all great remedies have their side effects. For me (40-something female) that meant some hair loss and memory issues. Also, I&#039;ve noticed that if I miss even one dose (I take 150 mg twice a day) I start to get really agitated and irritable, so I&#039;m afraid that it&#039;s permanently altered my biochemistry - guess I&#039;m stuck with it.

The teacher said she knew he knew the info but getting it out of him was like pulling teeth before. Now he is doing exactly what she wants him to do.""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My son has been on this since last year, from the start of school (2nd week of August) until the end of September he had 32 office referrals! I was at wits end and didn&#039;t know where to turn and as a Psychology major didn&#039;t want to use meds, but needed something. We talked to his doctor and she prescribed this and at first it was rough the first week his attitude became worse and my wife wanted to try something new but I stuck with it and from the time he went on the meds to the end of the school year he only had 1 office referral and that was because we forgot his meds. Now the he does play sports and has a great personality but the only problem I have is his weight. Since he has been in it now for 1 year he has lost 3-5 lbs.""",1
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Have been taking Belviq for two and a half months have lost 10 lbs.  First two days had a headache and felt weird, but then it went away and I have noticed I sleep like a rock (albeit I do have weird dreams).  I also have a lot LESS anxiety, so I am unsure what that is about?  I don&#039;t have any other side effects except that I am MUCH less hungry, don&#039;t really think about food like I use to.  It has been so much easier to stay on track and just eating like a normal human.  I feel GREAT and am very grateful to this drug.""",3
Alprazolam,Depression,"""I was prescibed Xanax and it works well for things like panic attacks. I do not like that it makes me loopy by taking my prescibed mg, and if I cut it in half I feel that it doesn&#039;t work at all. Xanax works very well for short term anxiety and if highly addictive so it is best to take it when you absolutely NEED it. A Prn that is supposed to work like Xanax but isn&#039;t addictive starts with a V so ask your doctor about that. :)""",5
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I wrote a few days ago on 11/13/15. I finally started feeling an increase in my mood over the weekend! It is still very early on, and I am only on Latuda 40mg, but this has left me feeling very optimistic! I got out of bed a little easier today, and when I got to work I had lots of energy. One of my friends texted me and I actually felt excited to text him back (most of my friends know that I&#039;m hard to get a hold of since I&#039;ve been so isolating). It&#039;s still early in the morning as I write this, and my depression tends to get worse toward the end of the work day since I don&#039;t know exactly what I will do with myself once I get home for the day, but I am feeling better and I can only hope things continue in this direction!""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started using Adipex March 08 weighing in at 332lbs. As of September 08 now 284lbs. Lost 48lbs in 6 months. At first had a little trouble going to sleep but that went away after a coule of weeks. I think that the pill is totally worth it. Now I have REALLY picked up my exercise routine and I am now very cautious about what I eat. Very little starch at all. Exercise consists of 3-4 miles on treadmill at 6-7 mph then 30-45 minutes in a sauna EVERY DAY. I would suggest taking the pill for 2-3 weeks then laying off for a week. This is what has worked for me.""",3
Tramadol,Pain,"""Ultram is the only medication I can take for pain that doesn&#039;t make me sick.  Lortab, Norco, etc. all make me sick at my stomach. Darvocet used to be what I preferred as it didn&#039;t make me feel sick, hate that it was taken off the market. But after hand surgery and being prescribed Ultram, it&#039;s nice to know there is a pain medication out there that works and doesn&#039;t make me throw up. Highly recommend.""",9
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started contrave in April, 2015 and I have lost 80 lbs. I weighed 260!  I am a firm believer of this medicine.  I had to stop taking it because they changed manufacturers from Takada to Orexigen and the price went from  $60 to over $90. I am on medicare and have no other insurance to help the cost. I wanted to lose about 20 more pounds or so, but since this happened I pray that I won&#039;t gain the weight back.  So far on Contrave I have not gained any on the weight I lost, but I can tell a difference now that I have stopped taking it.  It scares me, I don&#039;t want to gain weight!! Good luck to everyone, maybe we all can get together and contact this new manufacturer and get them to lower the price!!""",2
Kadian,Pain,"""Chronic pain associated with ulcerative colitls and multiple bowel surgeries. Had large intestine removed, now have permanent ileostomy. I have a ridiculously high pain tolerance, and after trying out the fentanyl transdermal patch (50 mcg every 48 hrs) and taking 10-12 Percocet 10/325 a day, my pain management doctor prescribed Kadian 30 mg every 12 hrs and Percocet for my breakthrough pain. Kadian has been amazing and is helping me get back to my day-to-day life.""",9
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I have been on multiple medications for the burning and tingling and shooting pains in lower legs.
Finally have found the most rewarding relief.  I seen a endoctronologist  and she ordered a nutriotional drug called Metanex.  I take 1 capsule twice a day and the Elavil 50 mg at bedtime.  I give thanks to God and that&#039;s it.  unbelievable relief in the symptoms I have suffered with for over a year.  anyone with these symptoms should look into getting there Dr to order the Metanex for them in conjunction with the Elavil.""",9
Yasmin,Birth Control,"""I just started taking this pill not yet through the first week, and already I&#039;m covered in acne which I never had using the IUD. I decided I didn&#039;t want the IUD anymore after the five years were up because it poked my partner and is something I can&#039;t take out myself. Anyways Yasmin has caused me crazy acne like teenager status (I&#039;m 25) and has caused me breast tenderness when I used to feel no tenderness at all. I read the reviews about gaining a cup size.. I hope that doesn&#039;t happen to me, I already have  DD&#039;s. We&#039;ll see how the next few months play out, but so far NOT IMPRESSED""",8
Xanax XR,Anxiety,"""I have daily anxiety and was on Ativan for a while and while I loved the Ativan I was looking for something longer acting - my psychiatrist tried me on Xanax XR 0.05mg. For me, this medicine is a God send. In the beginning when I first starting taking it I did notice some slight dizziness and &#039;weird&#039; feelings but I stuck with it and once it regulated in my system (about 3-4 weeks) I feel totally normal and calm on it with zero side effects. I have since upped my dose to the 1mg Xanax XR twice daily if I need it, but some days I only take one pill to get me through the day and deal with the anxiety at night since I&#039;m home and then take a pill in the morning like normal. My advice would be to start it on the lowest dose and work your way up.""",7
Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking Zyprexa for about 5 years. Started at 5 mg and am now at 2.5 or 1.25, depending on the day. This is for bipolar. I&#039;ve tried to go off it (because I felt dulled and had a preoccupation with food) a few different times and had severe depression/anxiety symptoms recur. I also take Prozac (20mg) and Lamictal (100 mg). I don&#039;t think the Lamictal does anything but the Zyprexa seems to be the &quot;glue&quot; that keeps me together. Weight gain was an issue but have recently lost 20 lbs through diet and exercise (and reducing dose). I would rather not have to take it but it so greatly improves my quality of life that I feel I should stay on it.""",6
Intuniv,ADHD,"""My son is 7 and just started Intuniv about a month ago. He has ADHD, BiPolar and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. He is currently on a lot of medicines. They started in on Intuniv because he was unable to focus at school and extremely hyper. With him being bipolar it is very hard for them to treat his ADHD because the stimulant medicines make him go crazy. He tries to hurt himself and others while on those. He is on 1mg on the Intuniv and we&#039;ve yet to see any good effects from it. He has never been able to sleep well, they told me this would help with that. But sadly it hasn&#039;t. He is on a sleeping pill as well. He still tends to wake up very early in the morning. Some mornings it&#039;s 2am some it&#039;s 4. They told us to go ahead and add another sleep aid.""",1
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I have been taking 30 mg of Temazepam nightly for about 3 months.  This is the 2nd time that I have taken it.  I took it for about 2 years and it eventually quit working so I tried both Ambien and Trazodone.  Ambien was all right until it quit working after about 4 months.  I couldn&#039;t take Trazodone at all because it made me very dizzy and caused me to have horrible nightmares so I am back on Temazepam.  So far, it has been working well but this time I have been taking it with 10 mg nightly of Melatonin.  I started with 3 mg of Melatonin and have gradually increased it to 10 mg nightly.  The combination of Temazepam and Melatonin seems to be working very well for me.  I go to sleep fairly quickly and stay asleep with no bad dreams.""",0
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had this inserted right about a year ago. I moved from the depo shot to the iud, i have also tried the pill in the past. The shot and the pill both gave me really out of control mood swings, so I thought this would be better. I will say that it is very effective, I have not had a period since I have been on it and have had no pregnancies. The major drawback for me is the mood swings and depression. The first six months were okay, nothing too noticeable. After that mood swings/depression/anger/anxiety hit me like a freight train. As for the birth control itself I would give it a 10/10 in effectiveness and ease of use. I&#039;m getting mine removed because I can&#039;t deal with the emotional side effects anymore.""",8
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""After being on 900mg a day of quitiapine and gaining 8 stone in weight, I knew something wasn&#039;t right. Yes I was stable but I was also numb and lack lustre. Tried a few other meds but none agreed until lamotrigine appeared. Hallelujah!! 5 stone weight loss over 4 months without dieting and I felt like me again for the first time in 8yrs. Took a while to get correct dosage as it was originally too high and made me vomit. I still have major down times but they only last days instead of months. Mostly I am energetic and full of life but not to the point of hypomania. My outlook on life is far more positive and I am more responsible and far less chaotic. I also take small doses of pregabalin and respiridone.""",6
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""last 15 tears of taking Klonopin have been a total improvement of my quality of life. and an improvement in anxiety to the point where I am like the friendliest guy in town so to speak. where as before taking Klonopin I had severe social  phobia . as a result the stress was definetly related to making me get cancer at 40 years of age. it works. buspar and all the other more popular anti anxiety meds did not work and I don&#039;t want to stop taking Klonopin.

Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""My Dr wanted to change my prescription of ambien CR. And put me on belsomra. Didn&#039;t sleep for more than 10 minutes at a time, then couldn&#039;t tell if I was asleep or awake.  Probably the worst nights sleep I&#039;ve ever not had.  On top of this, I also suffer from depression. If you do, DON&#039;T take this drug. The next day all my work colleagues kept asking me why I was so sad.  I know you are supposed to take it for a few days.  I can&#039;t take that risk.  I&#039;ll just buy ambien if I have to.  I&#039;ve been taking it for 10 plus years and have never had any side effects  just good night&#039;s sleep.  I can&#039;t believe how depressed I&#039;m still feeling. """,0
Dapsone,Acne,"""I have never written a review in my life but usually read other reviews for insight. I promised myself that if I&#039;ll find a single product to help my cystic acne - I would post my very first review. I just turned 27, never had acne as a teenager, started getting horrible,huge, cystic acne lumps about three years ago and it kept getting worse, really a nightmare. I was afraid to go to the doctor as they would constantly try to prescribe birth control, which I am very much against. Finally, in May I went to see a dermatologist and she suggested aczone. and warned me that it may not even help my terrible acne and if it does it would only start working after 3 months. She was right about three months, it took exactly 3 months until I started se""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Have been taking Adipex for almost 2 weeks.  The first week I did notice an energy surge, but now I&#039;m back to my normal levels. I have no appetite in the morning, a bit of an appetite for lunch, and have to watch what I eat for dinner.  I vigorously exercise for 60 minutes 5 times a week.  I have lost 10 lbs so far.  I am glad for the help with the appetite, but am always contemplating the pros and cons.""",3
Accutane,Acne,"""Accutane gave me completely clear skin after 7 months of using it and 4 years of severe acne. Even though people say they got horrible scars from the zits they had during their treatment, I have very few and they&#039;re small enough that you can&#039;t see them unless your face is right next to mine. I got a dry scalp, lips, and skin, but it was never enough to prevent me from wearing contacts like some people warn. To help with dry lips, get Dr. Dan&#039;s Cortibalm. It&#039;s the best chapstick out there. I got minor to moderate pain in my knees too, but it wasn&#039;t anything I couldn&#039;t put up with. And that horrible breakout that they tell you you&#039;re going to have when you first start? Mine was barely noticeable.""",4
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""NEVER HAD AN ANXIETY ATTACK AFTER LEXAPRO. I used to have very severe anxiety , and I had to go to hospital multiple times thinking I had heart attacks.  I had hot/cold flashes, chest pains, pounding heart, couldn&rsquo;t breathe, dizziness.... unfortunately I got off of it to take a pill for my Tourette&rsquo;s syndrome a few weeks ago and my anxiety came back and the new pill made me sick , so now my anxiety is back badly and I had to go to hospital multiple times thinking I had heart issues again... just got put back on lexipro a week ago hasn&rsquo;t started working yet I hope it kicks in :( I also took buspar with lexapro before it is a second anxiety pill and u can take them together .""",7
Bupropion,Depression,"""I have had mild depression for about 13 years and it got really bad once I got married, had a kid, bought an apartment, and went through financial crisis. I was always able to over look it and continue by dealing with depression, then I started having panic attacks and initially I was on Celexa which made me have the most horrible night terrors. Then I was just purely on Aderrall and Xanax which was a daily fix, finally I read about this medication and this is my second day and I have to say that this is the first time that I went through my day feeling &quot;normal.&quot; I am not feeling tired, unmotivated, down, etc. I sleep great so far and the medicine started working the first day!

Minocycline,Acne,"""Just wanted to share my experience on this drug. Within weeks, my skin went from what I would describe as &quot;nasty as hell&quot; to &quot;clear, with some residual redness&quot;. For my skin, it worked wonderfully.
HOWEVER. I am one of the rare few who&#039;s depression/anxiety was made 100x worse. Also I gained a dissociative personality, which basically boils down to: I had panic attacks BAD. All of the time. I was also in a constant state of not knowing what was real or not. Moments of not knowing who I was, where I was, having to force myself to ground back into reality because I wasn&#039;t sure what was real or not. My doctor never asked if I had mental health problems, and I am now on anti-psychotics.""",4
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking Saphris 10 mg at bedtime 2 months ago and I have never taken a medicine that is so powerful but without the horrific side effects of it.  My mother and I take care of 6 children and so I have a bunch of different personalities that are around me each and every day. When I started taking this medicine it took a great deal of heaviness I was carrying around with me off and that is exactly what I needed. The only side effect it gave me was the bitterness as it dissolves under your tongue, but that is well worth it for me.  I am on Depakote as well, I started Saphris about a month ago. I am getting off of Depakote and staying on Saphris - it is a miracle.""",6
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had the worst experience ever with nexplanon. I got my nexplanon in July 2014 and am happy to say that I am finally getting it removed today after 2 and a half years of misery. I bled almost Everyday! My younger sister had the same symptoms as I did but had hers removed before me. I have gained 25 pounds and had the worst mood swings that I&#039;ve ever had. Definitely review your options before getting nexplanon but also keep in mind it&#039;s different for everyone.""",8
Saxenda,Obesity,"""Started Saxenda 9 days ago today, initially weighed 301.2 and I&#039;m down to 291.2 lbs, SO TEN POUNDS! I am so excited, I&#039;ve been to the gym 5x this week, eating less than 1200 calories a day, have had no desire for sweets or sugary sodas.. which were my two main vices.  Really happy with my results thus far.  Have been lucky to not have any major side effects, some random stings at injection site, slight constipation and maybe 10 seconds of nausea here and there.  Just increased to the 1.2 dosage... ready to see where this will take me.""",2
Acanya,Acne,"""I&#039;ve struggled with acne since I was about 13. I&#039;ve used Proactive, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, AcneFree, etc. and every other acne system you can think of. 
This product gets rid of my acne in about 4 days; it is all I need now. It doesn&#039;t matter what face wash, or toners you use with this, because all you need is the Acanya gel. It&#039;s pretty expensive but one bottle (only put on problem spots) lasts me about 4 months.

Acanya has completely has kept my acne away for about a year now. As soon as you put it on, the next morning the size of the bumps reduce in size dramatically. About a week later, I had no acne. I didn&#039;t have bad skin, I just needed the right product.""",4
Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""The pill gave me aura migraines and mood swings and my period wasn&#039;t any better, in fact my cramps got worse, bleeding was still the same. I wanted to try the IUD but my doctor is an airhead and couldn&#039;t get it in, so I settled with the patch. I honestly couldn&#039;t tell if it was working the first couple of months because I had no side effects like nausea or headaches. And I was a little leery about hormones coming from a sticker you put on your skin...but 7 months later, no baby, so it must be working. I went off it for a month because my prescription refill got messed up and I went back on as soon as I got another box and I seriously could not tell the difference between having these on and not using any birth control at all. Loving it!""",8
Nucynta,Pain,"""I was prescribed Nucynta, Celebrex and a muscle relaxer due to a fall at work that resulted in a torn hip tendon. I was also in &quot;pool therapy&quot; for 12 weeks as well.  Nucynta saved my life! I took it 3x&#039;s per day and was completely functional while taking it and the other prescriptions.  I only needed it for 60 days but I was able to work as our company worker&#039;s comp did not pay for anything beyond 5 days of off time due to injury.  I highly recommend it but you prescribing doctor must adhere to the prescription writing protocol in place by the manufacturer. Nucynta must be the only medicine on the prescription form, the prescription is not faxable - you must present the actual prescription in person.""",9
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""This drug is pretty good. I like how 1 dose can last most of the day, but I was on 1mg klonopin after being on 2x2mg lorazepam a day and the klonopin doesn&#039;t seem as effective. I like it because it does not cause as much drowsiness as Xanax, but it does make me a lot more drowsy than lorazepam. You can take it once a day for simplicity, but like all benzodiazapines are addictive.

I started suffering bad panic attacks after switching, but I believe that was the mistake of my doctor by not converting the doses correctly.""",7
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had Skyla inserted in October of 2015. The insertion wasn&#039;t very painful at all. There was a pinch when they inserted it, but nothing more. I had taken 2 ibuprofen prior to the procedure. For about 2 months after the insertion, I had constant spotting, which was pretty annoying. Since then, my periods have been normal. Twice, I have gotten pelvic cramps after having sex, though I am not sure whether this is related to the IUD. Overall, it is more than worth it to have the peace of mind that I won&#039;t get pregnant.""",8
Minocycline,Acne,"""I randomly started getting bad acne on my cheeks and chin a year ago, after using epiduo it got a lot better. Recently at 18 I&#039;ve been seeing some flare ups so my Derm perscribed this antibiotic for me. After just a couple days I was pleased that the drug was preventing any new breakouts (it wasn&#039;t really clearing up the existing spots though). I started noticing that I would get extremely dizzy really easily, after a week on this pill I can not stand without feeling like I&#039;m going to throw up and My acne seems WORSE. I will NEVER take Minocycline again!""",4
Cymbalta,Depression,"""Three months on Cymbalta now and doing ok. I posted before that I started out on a very small dose and over 6 weeks got it up to 30 mg. I felt better than I ever had in my life! Then I tried to get it up further but suffered from horrible constipation and gas. Took me a while to know why, but now I am going back to 30 because I think that might be the right dose for me. It&#039;s all a bit experimental, but I do know that I couldn&#039;t bear to feel like I did before with no medicines. Just so anxious all the time for no reason, had to stop doing a lot of things in life, altogether so much less than I could be. Still grateful for this medicine.""",5
Trintellix,Depression,"""Does cause mild nausea at first and also when changing doses but I take it night and usually slept right through it, it only lasts an.hour or so. Other than that I love it. I was feeling hopeless, stressed, accussing my boyfriend constantly of being negligent. I was taking prozac before and it worked but made me tired and I blacked out when I drank. With brintillex I skip it if I drink and have plenty of energy and no issues. I felt good just a couple days after taking it but that subsided then a couple weeks later the &quot;cloud&quot; of depression just sorta lifted.""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I was on a 16 week course with 30mg/day the first month &amp; then 50mg/day the remainder of the time. At first it got a lot better, then it got a lot worse - which is to be expected. It took so long as to the 14th week to really see a big change and now I&#039;ve just finished the full 16 weeks and my skin is better than ever. There are still some spots that need to be healed but other than that I&#039;m amazed. 
My doctor explained to me that the medication keeps working in your body for 8 weeks after you&#039;ve stopped taking the pills &amp; when you&#039;re on them some people&#039;s skin is so sensitive it&#039;s like glass &amp; therefore for some people the pills really work its wonders after you&#039;ve stopped them. So DON&#039;T give up. Also, Aquaphor is lifesaver for dry lips.""",4
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""This is one horrible drug.  I was given this to help with insomnia as I weened off Clonazepam. I am already on blood pressure medication and the first week I ended up in ER twice with blood pressure reading up near 200, hyperactive, blurred vision, and the shakes.  My pressure has continued to roller coaster all over the board for the past two weeks. My regular doctor and cardiologist didn&#039;t seem to care so I switched and went to a different health provider.  He now has me tapering me off the Tarazadone and is confident my blood pressure will return to normal.""",0
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Best thing to ever happen to me!  I love this medication and will recommend it to anyone and everyone. Been on it since 12/15/16 and down 15 lbs.  Its not as much as the majority of other Contrave users have lost within 5 months but that is my fault.  I still eat what I want, just less of it and I don&#039;t work out.  I&#039;m sure if I ate better and got active I would lose more weight.  I have been lazy!
In regards to side effects, they were very strong for me.  I had nausea, blurry vision and dizziness but learned to control it with protein.  I cannot express how much protein has helped me!  It has replaced my breakfast and I drink it along with coffee and grapefruit oil infused water.  I no longer crave or worry about food like before """,3
Perphenazine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was very hot-headed with sudden rage or seething anger all of my life until I got on Perphenezine.  This is an amazing drug.  I NEVER get angry now.  I did get angry once at something which I believe is justified, but I didn&#039;t feel deep rage inside.  It went away. I have been on Perphenizine for a year or so now and I feel like a totally different person.  It did take a little while, maybe a few months (I&#039;m not sure) to take effect.  I was psychotic when I first began taking it (delusional).  It is an amazing drug.  Also, I can think more clearly &amp; think &quot;better,&quot; which is hard to describe.  I can solve problems more easily, analyze situations and it feels as if my &quot;engine turned over&quot; (brain) and I am smarter now, much smarter.  Amazing!""",6

Down 38.2lbs, once again basically with no exercise, just Contrave which in turn gave me the ability to make better food choices, and has lead to watching my carb and calorie intake. It IS a lifestyle change. One I never thought I could make, but it takes repeatedly making good choices for it to become a habit, and with Contrave I care what I put in my mouth now, cuz I want to keep losing and not gain. Friday is my cheat day!! :-)""",2
Doxycycline,Acne,"""This has worked very well for my acne, nothing I have tried in 3 years has worked this well. However, I am an athlete and I&#039;m out in the sun everyday and if this same thing applies to you, do not take this. It makes you very sensitive to the sun and you will be in so much pain, especially in your hands. If you start taking this and feel sensitive to hot and cold, and notice your hands turning red then stop using this immediately because it only gets worse.""",4
Buprenorphine,Pain,"""I have suffered really sore muscles as the patch wears off. My neck feels like I have whiplash and my upper back and shoulders feel stiff and hurt. I&#039;m always well aware when it&#039;s time to change the patch. The problem is that the muscle pain starts to get really bad on the 5th day. Because of the 4 patch per month limit, I have to wait. Vicodin makes me feel loopy and Tramadol makes me feel completely out of it. I will be speaking with my doctor to see what he recommends I do. I, too have rashes at the patch site as mentioned by many others and the itching can get quite embarrassing as I don&#039;t realize I&#039;m standing at the meat counter at the grocery store scratching my belly until someone starts to stare.

Lithobid,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lithium was hard for me to take at first. If I did not eat enough with the medicine I would vomit. The medicine works for me but I do not like the fact that I have gained weight and it causes acne. I have done everything I can to have clear skin but it does not matter what I do. Lithium is cheap and effective but like I said I don&#039;t like the side effects. I am going to try Tegretol when I go back to the Doctor.""",6

I went from maintaining around 110-113lbs to maintaining 123-125lbs and not being able to lose weight AT ALL!!! I was worried about weight gain, stuck to my pre bc regime and still gained the weight.

Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My 7 year old son started Vyvanse about 3 weeks ago.  The first day he took a 30 mg dose which made him like a zombie all day and absolutely manic all night.  He literally stayed up all night and ran up and down the hall and talked incessantly.

At the end of my rope at 7 am I paged his doctor.  We lowered the dose to 15 mg.

He seemed initially to do better on the 15mg and was doing well in school.  He became more aggressive and started having OCD behaviors of constantly washing his hands (I counted 30 times in an hour) and crying and staying up all night.  Last night he stayed up until 4:30 am and I was at my wits end.

So today his doctor is switching him to another medication but we may try it in a combination.""",1
Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This is the 2nd time using this medicine. The 1st time it rid me of the severe depressive cycle I was in, but the mania crept back in very slowly so I didn&#039;t notice it until it was too late. And by late, I mean &quot;all over the place&quot; so I stopped taking it. This time around I am taking it coupled with Lamictal. The cycles are normalizing now after just over 2 months. Want to add that I put myself on a sleeping schedule and use medicine if I need it after 20 minutes of no sleep. This sleep program has helped tremendously.""",6
Nucynta,Pain,"""I first reviewed this in November 2010, (see past comments). I have since had ALIF surgery (anterior multi level fusion l-3, 4 and 5), and am feeling better everyday. I have been prescribed every painkiller in the book for the past year and a half, nothing provides the pain relief with minimal side effects that Nucynta does. Nothing. In the hospital I was injected with 2mg morphine every 3 hours plus oxycodone every 4 hours and was a complete zombie. Left the hospital, took 100mg Nucynta and received the same relief with no ill effects. It&#039;s been 2 weeks. Now taking 50mg 3x daily.""",9

Thank goodness my family and SO were by my side but nothing helped me. I was THRILLED when I found out about phentermine. I did my research and even though there was scary stuff posted about it, I didn&#039;t care...I wanted this weight gone. And gone it went! 30 LBS IN 3 MONTHS! Yes, some people can have bad reactions but that&#039;s no reason to give it a bad review because it does what it&#039;s supposed to!""",3

I noticed the side effects of an intense fog, and slight dizziness (similar to a Nyquil haze) about the 1st day or two, then it went away. I feel the cravings going away, it could be a placebo effect given that the cost I paid vs. my income could possibly just be will power finally kicking in. I will try to update as I go to full dosage, hopefully this will be what it takes to get my lifestyle a bit better. My wife runs like a 5K every other day, and I want to join her...""",2
Metadate CD,ADHD,"""My 8 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD nearly 1 year ago. We tried 4 different medications - 2 gave him side effects of not being able to sleep AND a high anxiety.  2 did nothing for him.  Then we tried Metadate CD. We started with 10 mg, which didn&#039;t really do anything. 20mg was better, but still some issues in the attention area.  We are now at 30 mg, and it&#039;s great. His teacher has also said that school is much better. He makes sense in his answers, he&#039;s not blurting out or disrupting the class.  We give it to him at 6:45 am, and can get through a bit of homework until 5:30pm.  Then it&#039;s worn off. I think that&#039;s a great amount of time and NO side effects of lack of sleep, lack of appetite, or mood/anxiety issues.  I hope it continues.""",1
Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,"""Ortho tri cycles saved my face! I&#039;ve dealt with cystic acne flare ups for years. I experienced HUGE cysts that would distort my face. I&#039;ve tried EVERYTHING to rid myself of them (even did a round of accutane 10 years ago) but they persistently return. 

7 months ago I switched from Alesse to and it&#039;s made an incredible difference. The first 4 months were really rough (I broke out A LOT but noticed the cysts were actually coming to a head and draining for the first time ever). I almost gave up out of frustration but I&#039;m glad I stuck it out. My face has been totally manageable, just the small NORMAL occasional pimple around my period.

Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""It seems to be helping, but still some depression remains.  I have Bipolar Type 1, so I have struggled with mania, hypomania, mixed mood, and depression.  I do notice I&#039;m more &quot;even,&quot; which is what the medicine intends to do.  I take a combination of meds, so it could be difficult to tell which medicine is doing what.  All I know is that I have no side effects, which is good, because I requested a mood stabilizer that will not make me gain weight.  Overall, I&#039;m satisfied with the way things are going (thank goodness, because Bipolar could be hell).""",6
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I had to go onto Oxycodone as I became allergic to buprenorphine patches &amp; reached the limit of how much morphine I could tolerate.  With Oxycodone my pain relief is better than morphine, the migraines are still a problem but less &#039;sharp&#039; than when I took morphine.
As I live in England I am able to take oxycodone as an extended release drug called &#039;Targinact&#039;.  It is a combination of oxycodone but also naloxone, which elimintes the biggest problem with opiates.....constipation.  Targinact works amazingly well - I can take oxycodone in high doses but with no constipation.  It is a shame that it isn&#039;t available in the US.  Although it is more expensive than oxycodone, all my prescriptions are free thanks to our wonderful healthcare system.""",9

Xanax,Depression,"""I love Xanax. I wish I could take it daily but my doctor won&#039;t prescribe it to me for daily use, because she doesn&#039;t want me to get addicted to it.  I only take Xanax on rare occasions, when I was extremely distraught.  It made me feel better instantly. I&#039;ve only taken 25 mg, but that was more than enough to make everything seem great.  I was aware that my problems still existed, but I wasn&#039;t overwhelmed by them.  It made me feel warm and happy.  I&#039;ve taken other drugs before and Xanax is by far, the best choice.""",5

Methamphetamine,ADHD,"""I barely had enough time in the day to meet the obligations of my job until I began taking methamphetamine. It really energized me to focus on the task at hand and nothing else. Shortly after I began taking Methamphetamine I received two promotions at work and was given an additional supervisory role.  As an added benefit it curbed my appetite allowing me to work through lunch and in some cases even dinner without taking a break. Also there is almost no physical side effect, unlike Vyvanse and Amphetamine Salts made my body and head ache as well as gave me a craving to chain smoke.

Armodafinil,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started using nuvigil two months ago to help ease the symptoms of depression associated with my bioplar II. Overall this medication has by no means cured me, but it has allowed me to become much more functional when I am depressed. It helps me think a lot clearer, makes me more positive, and most importantly just gives me the motivation to get stuff done when I would otherwise have absolutely zero motivation to do anything. I only take this when I am depressed, as I have found it makes me kind of irritable when I am hypomanic and it just makes it really hard to sleep.

It&#039;s been almost 3 months. My acne has gotten a little worse. But I have read it gets worse before it gets better. I was so fed up with my acne I went to my gyno to get my blood hormone tested. She came back saying I have high testosterone which is causing the acne! So after that result I went in for a vagina ultrasound and I was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic ovarien syndrome).

I tried the 0.1% gel from Walmart. I was aware it would take awhile so I gave it two months to work. My skin looks so much better now. I use Neutrogena anti-wrinkle moisturizing on top of it. I&#039;m guessing if it&#039;s like any retinol product you have to build into using higher percentage, at this point I could probably ask my doctor for 0.3% but I figure why mess with a good thing.""",4

My skin is a little worse off than it was on the pill but not unmanageable. The only other major side effects are that my libido has almost completely disappeared and I have gained a bit of weight  I can&#039;t seem to shake(although I&#039;m actively working out and dieting).

Some side effects I have noticed are the occasional headache (I find if I take it the same time each morning I don&#039;t get a headache), drymouth, and if I miss a dose I get absolutely WILD dreams and my anxiety comes creeping back in.

It&#039;s not a cure all, and maybe the highs of life are not as frequent, but they still come.  And I&#039;d rather have that and contentment than the awful lows.  No free rides, but I enjoy my friends, exercise, family, and relationships.  Overall, a Godsend for me.""",5
Concerta,ADHD,"""Yes, this medicine does work very well for paying attention. It also can be used when you need it and can stop and start use (you can just take it on schooldays even just important school days if you want). It&#039;s good that you don&#039;t have to ruin your weekend with the bad side effects. If you just take one like I have for five years you&#039;ll focus but by noon you&#039;ll be a zombie that hates the sound of people trying to make pointless conversation. """,1
Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on zyprexa for 5 days so far. I have been taking 2.5mg and I think I need to up the dose now to 5mg as it feels like it is wearing off. this medication is doing wonders for me, it is great! I can finally have 8 hours of un-disturbed sleep. Prior to commencing this medication, I was suffering from severe symptoms of mania such as insomnia, loss of appetite, high energy levels, psychotic symptoms (hearing voices, derealisation, making weird connections &amp; magical experiences), making new plans, reckless spending &amp; driving, new ideas, taking on too many tasks, agitation. the medication has calmed all of these symptoms. zyprexa is a god send for me. only side effect I have is low blood pressure from it.""",6
Minocycline,Acne,"""I never had problems with acne as a teenager or young adult. I&#039;m 47 &amp; I started getting terrible, very painful,  cystic acne about 6 months ago. It covered the entire surface of my chin &amp; some around my nose &amp; mouth. I was mortified &amp; depressed cause of these horrific awful lesions on my face. I would do everything possible to avoid interaction with people, I hated going anywhere other than home &amp; even at home it was hard to let my man look at me. I had no clue I had cystic acne. I thought it was just hormonal changes. I couldn&#039;t take it anymore, it wasn&#039;t going away no matter what I did. I went to the doctor &amp; he put me on Minocin twice a day &amp; within a week my face is 98% clear. I can hold my head up again with confidence.""",4
Effexor XR,Depression,"""I first used Effexor XR 75 mg at the start of 2016 to treat depression/ anxiety. Side effects were things such as dry mouth, frequent urination, problems sleeping at night. After 2 weeks these reduced greatly and after a further 2 weeks my mood improved greatly and my anxiety reduced. My ongoing side effects were strange (not unpleasant) dreams and sometimes night sweats - neck and chest. I tapered off to 37.5 and then stopped October 2016. The withdrawals - head zaps in the main - lasted about a week and were not too bad. I stopped because I  felt so much better.
During mid 2017 I went down hill again and was back at the GP&#039;s sobbing my heart out and at home being a complete pain to my wife. I started 75mg again 4 weeks ago. Much better!""",5
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I am a 47 yo male who has been on 100mg of Pristiq for 2 years.  First on 50mg then increased.  I found I was sleepy for the first few months but nothing compared to the original symptoms like depression, anxiety etc.  My only concern is the withdrawal effects.  On one occasion, I went to Pharmacy on Saturday and they advised I needed a new script.  I had to wait until Monday to get a script and they were the two worst days in my life....the withdrawal was chaotic, I argued with the chemist in a rage....never done this before...I called them an hour later sobbing and apologising for my behavior, I had awful flashes in my eyes and headaches that made a migraine feel like party.....I was frantic at the doctor on the Monday morning""",5
Mirena,Birth Control,"""Was on Gianvi for around 4 years, Age 20-24.  Worked great in the beginning when life was normal, but kept forgetting once life got busy. Decided to get an Mirena, but did not do the research because I know people leave crazy reviews and did not want to psych myself out. Went with Mirena over Paraguard because of heavy bleeding. Now I know better. Had an active sex life, but it had to stop because of the nonstop brown discharge, then the endless period. Been on it for 17 days. I really don&#039;t like it so far. """,8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had acne since I was 11. Nothing my doctor prescribed had any effect on my skin so I started my course of isotretinoin when I was 17. In short, it gets worse before it gets better. My skin only started improving in the last month of my course. I still have acne but it&#039;s not nearly as bad (and with my newly vamped up skincare routine it&#039;s getting better daily).
As with most acne treatments, it was pretty drying (you&#039;ll need a good moisturizer and lip balm) but it&#039;s nothing permanent. I didn&#039;t find the pregnancy/blood tests a hassle either, at this point I was willing to do anything to sort out my skin. I think it was totally worth it! If, like me, you&#039;ve had acne for years and years, it&#039;s definitely worth a try!""",4
Effexor,Depression,"""Terrible med. for me like it was for a lot of people.  I used it for 6 weeks (enough time to get into my system).  It caused panic attacks, which was not fun.  I would have several each day.  I was taking this med. for anxiety and depression.  I cried every single day, and several times a day on this med. and I did not sleep a full nights sleep for the entire duration. I felt way more sad, and felt like I was in a zombie like state daily.  I read reviews of this drug and prayed that I would soon start to feel better, and wouldn&#039;t be one of those that this drug did not work for.  Alas, I was one of those.  I stopped taking Effexor, cold turkey 5 days ago.  Best thing I ever did.  I experienced some withdrawal symptoms, like severe brain zaps""",5
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""Lamictal has been the most all round effective medication I have take and that is saying a lot for a patient of 40 years. What I mean by that is my system rejected all antidepressants and antipsychotics because of a side effect called Akathesia. I sustained on lithium and Klonopin alone for a long time.
Back then doctors were scared to death of Lamictal because of the rash that few to none got when properly prescribed. I couldn&#039;t find one to prescribe so I got it from my family doctor. That was the best day of my life. I titrated the lithium while slowly adding the Lamictal with no problems. I have been taking 450mg a day ever since. I also noticed how badly 30 years of lithium had hurt me. I no longer knew myself.""",6
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am so proud to say that I have lost 67 lbs. so far with Contrave.  I am 6&#039; and had a starting weight of 327, was pre-diabetic, have fibromyalgia, and bp was creeping up the scale.   Contrave and my own personal decision to change my life are the key to success with  Contrave. This medicine has given me energy and focus...the kind of focus that stops my constant thoughts of food.  Just having finished thanksgiving I can honestly say that I am thinking about other things besides eating to satisfy the urge, now I eat for fuel and energy and concentrate on things that are good for me.  Finally there is more to life than food.  I even starting working out at a gym on Thanksgiving...LOL!!  Best advise my doctor has ever given me!!!""",2
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""Started taking phendimetrazine last Tuesday opted to be part of a study that a friend of mine told me about. I&#039;m 5&#039;9, 144lbs - by no means overweight. Yet, I was trying to shed just 10-15lbs to get back down to the weight I once loved and felt my best at. 2 a day an hour before meals. First day it suppressed my appetite and I was more than a little surprised - thought I hit the jackpot, as I am the queen of snacking throughout the day. 2nd and 3rd day didn&#039;t work as well as the first, 4th and 5th day worked good again. Now I&#039;m on my 7th day and today it hardly worked. Not sure what all the back and forth is about because I haven&#039;t done anything different. I will say that I&#039;ve dropped 4lbs in the past week, but I&#039;m also taking water pills.""",2
Topiramate,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have taken Topamax for the last 8 months as a mood stabilizer. It has worked great, not only has it helped with my moods, but it also helped me lose more than 30 lbs without struggling to lose it. It was easy and great. I am happy again and I don&#039;t feel like I want to chew off everyone&#039;s head when I start to get irritable or around &quot;that time of month&quot;. It&#039;s been a life saver.""",6
Acanya,Acne,"""I went to a new dermatologist because my acne is out of control.  I&#039;ve had acne for 10 years and this is the worst it has ever been.  He gave me Acanya for the morning and it stings so bad I could cry.  My face turns red, it&#039;s tight, burning, and not improving.  I&#039;ve been using Acanya for almost a week, I know results might take longer.  As for now, I am not happy. Just be warned, it is very drying and can make your day uncomfortable.""",4
Zovia,Birth Control,"""I have been on this pill for 3.5 years and it is my FAVORITE THING EVER. My periods are extremely light, I almost never have cramps or mood swings, and the only weight gain I experienced was welcome and came in the form of a cup size. I haven&#039;t had any problems during that time of the month or otherwise and overall, I think this is just a very nice, happy pill. I always use condoms because I&#039;m paranoid but I&#039;m scare-free also!""",8
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I have had a great experience with Klonopin. It has really saved my life. I tried Buspar and other SSRIs to help with my Anxiety but they never really took care of it. I was in a really bad funk about 6 months ago and the anxiety just kept building up. I went to my psych doc and she prescribed me Klonopin as needed at about 0.5mg a day. It makes me feel good through most days but with increased stress at work I feel I have to take a little more. I say, if it works take it. 10 out of 10 for me. It has given me back my life.""",7
Escitalopram,Depression,"""Hi. I am on day 16 of 10mg. The first 6 days I was very tired, excessively. But the majority of my anxiety was gone by then.  Days 6-8 I had severe insomnia, it passed and by day 9 I had no racing thoughts before going to slep. Today is day 16. I feel better about my life circumstances. I have a 9 year old with Aspergers. I am no longer spending every waking moment obsessing over what will become of his future. My cognitve functioning seems clearer.  Have been able to keep up more with home chores. Still not as energised as I would like to be. Coffee makes me more jittery since starting the meds. I can now tell the differnce between caffeine jitters and my real anxiety though.
I am hoping that by week 6-8 I have even more clarity.""",5
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I had Skyla placed just over month ago. I read the reviews and was expecting some really bad cramps during and after insertion. The cramping during insertion was minor and after insertion I experienced cramps for a day. These cramps was comparable to a bad period. As for the bleeding some people experienced, I still have yet to bleed or have my period. My doctor told me that this is can happen and I may not experience bleeding while on Skyla. Overall, I am so far pleased that I have had minor if any side effects and would recommend this to people.""",8
Contrave,Obesity,"""June 18, 2017 - I started taking Contrave at the end of January 2017. In the middle of March, I added two Garcinia Gambogia (95%) and 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar mixed with any fruit juice, on a daily basis.  I am female, and started out weighing 213 pounds. As of today, I have lost 26 pounds. This weight-loss medicine has helped me tremendously and I am looking forward to the next few months.  If you are considering this medication, be sure and look for the half price coupon. It will save you lots of $$$.  Good luck!""",2
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on the medication for a little over a week so it&#039;s a little early but here&#039;s my experience so far. The first couple of days I was very tired and experienced some stomach upset. I also had some emotional outbursts- some crying which has since subsided. I read other reviewers comments before taking this medication and saw that taking too much too fast or titrating this too fast lead to unpleasant effects that were intolerable so I&#039;ve titrated extremely slowly and I haven&#039;t even gotten to the lowest registered dosage yet but have consistently lost about a pound a day and have lost a total of 7 pounds since starting a week ago. I consistently have a very slight stomach ache after eating but it goes away fairly quickly and is tolerable""",3
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started this medicine for weight loss...I have type 2 dm with PCOS. I started adipex on 10/30/15. My weight was 260lbs and was very unhappy. My first week on this pill I lost 10lbs and the next week I weighed in a 245lbs  15lbs in two weeks!!! 
Its amazing results. I had major side effects ranging from headaches, upset stomach, diarrhea, blankness and heart racing, I stuck with it and only thing I have a problem is the diarrhea and upset stomach....I weigh myself tomorrow for the third week...the energy I have now is unbelievable...I&#039;m really happy I chose this...""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""It took a good month to start feeling like myself again. In the beginning I was so tired and just wanted to sleep all day (of course wasn&#039;t sleeping good at night). I did notice right away how my anxiety decreased and I wasn&#039;t snappy or having panic attacks anymore. I had a flat affect for about a month and that felt strange to not feel anything. Its been almost two months and overall I would say this medicine definitely helped make me feel more like myself again. I still a have rough moments but am able to get through the day a lot better. I don&#039;t recommend drinking while taking this medicine.""",5
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""Amazing medicine!  My doctor finally took me of Seroquel and put me on an upped dose of Latuda making my dosage 160 mg instead of 80 mg. I feel great and never better. I&#039;ve lost 20 lbs in a month! Now I&#039;m stuck at this weight but I did lose most of the weight I gained before.  It definitely makes me sleepy but I&#039;ve heard this goes away soon as your body adjusts.  As for the nausea I&#039;ve found eating small amount before and larger portion after taking the medicine and following it with a ginger pill and milk helps to stop it.""",6
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Qsymia for about 5 weeks and have lost about 15-17 pounds. Now my weight has plateaued and I can&#039;t seem to shake anymore weight off. It goes up two pounds, down two pounds, the same as before I began taking the pills. I have added some light exercise into my regimen and have gone down a clothing size. I&#039;m happy with that. I think my body is adjusting/adapting to the medication.  I&#039;m thinking of going off the Qsymia for a week or so to get it completely out of my system and start all over again. My cravings for sweets/candies have all but gone away. Every once in a while I&#039;ll indulge, but not nearly like I used to. I don&#039;t think about food until I&#039;m actually hungry.""",3
Ultram,Pain,"""I take Ultram for degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine,(spinal stenosis, dry disc) and for neck pain from auto accidents and sterno and acromioclavicular joint pain from open heart surgery.
It is the only thing I have used that works and gives me 8 hours of sleep. I only take it when the pain gets intolerable and renders sleep impossible. Have no withdrawal and the only side effect is constipation.
I highly recommend Tramadol. It helped me more than anything else.""",9
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I started on Saxenda on Aug 28th (6 weeks ago) and I have already lost 30lbs. Started at 286lbs and I am now at 255lbs Just like many people I started at the lowest dose, slowly increasing it. Side effects have been mild. Nausea being the most common but only the first day after increasing the dose. Along with taking Saxenda I started a meal plan  too. I totally recommend it. Now that I feel lighter I am more motivated to exercise. Bought myself an exercise bike and use it 5 times a week for 20 minutes. I have a long way to go but super motivated to continue. Will try to keep updating.""",2
Lutera,Birth Control,"""I was put on Lutera because of my unpredictable periods. I was bleeding non-stop for three months straight and after starting to take this pill the bleeding has stopped and almost two weeks later has not started again. Although I&#039;m happy it&#039;s regulating my periods I have found it to make me extremely sick. It makes me nauseous to the point where everything is spinning. In addition it has caused significant mood swings. I find myself getting upset quicker and have more of an appetite. The most significant problem I have had is problems with visions. Upon taking the pill I&#039;ve had trouble focusing and getting dizzy. I&#039;m going to continue for two more months to try to regulate my period then coming off Lutera due to the way I&#039;m feeling.""",8
Duac,Acne,"""I have had moderate acne since I was 13 I am now 15 I have used Duac cream for about a year. First it worked wonders and my skin cleared completely however I started to get acne on my chest and shoulders and found the cream didn&#039;t work for me in those areas I have also started to find my skin is becoming more resident to the cream so I have now been given Zineryt. Duac is definitely an amazing cream for acne maybe I will go back to it after giving my skin a break.""",4
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;m 55 and started not sleeping through the night especially after frequent business trips about 10 years ago. Started taking Ambien as needed, then almost every night which left me not feeling rested and recently only sleeping 3 or 4 hours. Doctor suggested 1 or 2 50mg Trazodone. I tried first time about 10 days ago. 1 made me feel physically very relaxed, like a muscle relaxer, but did not sleep. 2 almost made me feel sick...almost flu like. I finally fell asleep about 6 hours after I took it, and it was such a weird heavy sleep...I couldn&#039;t move. Last night I decided to try again. Same thing, heavy feeling but light sleep. Actually woke up 6 hrs later, read for a bit, then super heavy sleep but dreamed a lot. I couldn&#039;t get up until 9:15""",0
Solodyn,Acne,"""I&#039;ve just started this medication and so far so good. So far all I have noticed is that my pimples are coming to a head and my cysts are starting to level and also blackheads and whiteheads are vanishing. I&#039;m on the 80 mg Solodyn and I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s very high since most people her are on like 65 and 50 mg. I do get very dizzy, lightheaded, my stomach kills, and I have trouble focusing for about two hours after taking the antibiotic but it&#039;s a price I&#039;m willing to pay. I have sensitive skin and I like how this doesn&#039;t make me peel as much as the previous topical medication I was on (Ziana).  I&#039;m still suppose to use it but I like the results I&#039;m getting without it.  I would recommend this for sure.""",4
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Gabapentin was a life saving drug In regards to getting my bipolar under control. Before then, I had taken just about everything there was out there for bipolar, some would work, short lived, others I would not work at all. I was so angry all the time, for no apparent reason, and Lord forbid someone say something to me that upset me, I&#039;d bite their head right off and say mean, hurting words to those that I love. Finally, I was stable, no roller coaster moods, anger or rage. The medication also calmed my severe anxiety and I was able to get off of xanax, which I had to have or I&#039;d be a nervous, shaking, tremor in wreck, all day everyday !!! I might also add, that my severe depression was lifted, finally, I feel alive,well, and stable again.""",6
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""My doctor prescribed this medication 10g for my serious illness of anxiety I used to be so anxious I would feel sick at night and not being able to sleep in days. This medication has help me to sleep within a hour taking it I do wake up at 4.30- 5 every time I take it but fall back to sleep quite quickly. Only problem is that it does make me super drowsy in the morning.. Next time I take it I&#039;ll try only using 5 mg instead of 10 mg to stop the drowsiness. Other then that it has saved me life!""",0
Differin,Acne,"""The first 2 days of using differen gel were a little rough. My skin was super dry and I had to keep caking on the moisturizer. I took a couple days off from use and then started back daily use with no problem. I just moisturizer every morning. My skin still isn&#039;t perfect but it at least dries up the lager cystic acne. I still get blackheads around nose and small &quot;under the skin whiteheads&quot; around my chin. But I don&#039;t exfoliate like I should so that&#039;s my own fault.""",4
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I am 22 and I have always had moderate acne on my forehead since I was 13. I first started with 100mg of spiro which caused a horrible initial breakout. I stopped taking it for 1 month and started it again but on 50mg and it really cleared my skin. Within one month I started getting a terrible headache that lasted 1 week it was so unbearable i stopped taking the pill for a week now and my headache is completely gone. I don&#039;t know if this happened because my diet consists of mostly salt food, but I was seriously scared I thought I had a brain tumor. This pill is a diuretic so maybe it&#039;ll work well to those whom have a well balanced diet, but as soon as you feel side effects you should stop it immediately!!! :(""",4
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I was taking Ambien 15mg for awhile but my body built a tolerance to it.  Over 2 weeks ago my doctor changed my prescription to Lunesta 3mg.  I finally got up the nerve to take it after doing all the research.   This is the first I have taken and I must say the aftertaste after about 5 minutes of taking it is absolutely HORRIBLE.  Even breathing in through my mouth or nose heightens it.  It strongly reminds me of how my mouth would taste after taking chemotherapy for cancer.   It&#039;s causing a horrible flashback for me.  This will be the first and last Lunesta I take.  You also can&#039;t eat or drink anything as it tastes horrible too.  I guess I will have to go back to Ambien.""",0
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""Dilauded is the only pain medication that offers me any type of relief.  I herniated 3 discs in my lower back and I was on an IV of 2mg every 4 hours.  Only con was it made my face very itchy.  The second time I had an IV of Dilaudid was post spinal tap.  I was given 1mg injection every 2 hours (lower dosage, more frequently made pain more manageable).  I now have a prescription for 4mg every 3-4 hours for chronic back pain.  I believe it has dramatically improved my quality of life.""",9
OxyContin,Pain,"""Ahhhh, the dreaded drug...no matter what you call it, by whatever media-scare tactic out there, what isn&#039;t trumpeted are the success stories....why is that?  Does something have to be &quot;Negative&quot; to garner press?  And if so, why is that?

My story:  Two brain surgeries.  Manmouth amounts of pain.  I tried everything -- nothing lasted like this drug.  It has allowed me to go back to work, to live my life, to be a father to my children.  Screw the strange looks @the pharmacy...I&#039;m alive!""",9
Minocycline,Acne,"""I had really bad breakouts going into college. I took Solodyn paired with a topical called Ziana. I was really skeptical because I didn&#039;t notice any changes in the first 4-6 week trial period, but it really helped me clear up after about 3 months. I&#039;m mostly left with blemishes now which have not really improved since my breakouts stopped. I&#039;ve been on Solodyn for six months now, but I think I&#039;m going to stop because my acne feels controlled.""",4
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I had a spinal fusion that didn&#039;t fuse, 3 spinal surgeries total, broke hip, broke leg, several more bad discs in back. Opana is the only medicine that actually relieves the pain without the bad side effects. Take Opana 30 every 12 hours (twice daily), with Opana IR 10s in between. Doctor gives me 3 10s per day.   

Best medicine on the market as far as I know.   I can work and function now, where before I could barely get out of bed.   It is expensive, but so far insurance covers all but $100 per script per month.   High, yes, but worth it.""",9
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""After two valiant attempts to get past the adverse effects, I&#039;m finished with Depakote. The first attempt lasted a week; as it can exaggerate the effects of other meds, I became so drowsy I couldn&#039;t drive. For the second attempt, it wasn&#039;t combined with any other medication and lasted 3 weeks. I felt continually agitated and anxious, began to quickly gain weight, had terrible gas and was going to the bathroom 4-5 times a day. Additionally, my hair began to fall out so quickly, even my husband noticed (and he&#039;s NOT very observant!). The most disturbing symptom was the frequent presence of pronounced, irregular heart beats and at least one near-syncopal episode. All this in just 21 days-
 thanks but no thanks!""",6
Minocycline,Acne,"""I have been dealing with acne for a little over a year now. When I was 19 I randomly started to break out worse than I ever had my whole life. I think it was a combination of changing hormones and stress that caused it. Bottom line: I was desperate to return to the normal complexion I had growing up. I tried many different ways of treating it, but when I went on minocycline my face cleared up within 3 days. Yes, it had gotten slightly better with the birth control, so I don&#039;t know how well this will treat severe acne, but it definitely treated my close-to-severe acne. Your acne might need to be treated on the inside as well as the outside.""",4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I am 20 years old and I have always had problems with weight loss since I was in middle school. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Adipex. I have been on a low carb diet and I have been on Adipex for 9 days now and have lost 6 pounds so far. I am very happy with the results right now and I&#039;m hoping to keep at it and try to reach my goal weight! I am 5&#039;4 and before I started the diet I weighed in at 192lbs and so far I am down to 186lbs. My goal weight is 145 to 150lbs!""",3
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have been taking tramadol for 8 years.  Looking at all these reviews, my first response was that many of these folks are lying. However, maybe the effectiveness of this drug and its side effects are indeed all over the spectrum.  I researched the drug when first starting to use it and it had many fewer warnings and potential side effects then.  It was not considered a narcotic.  Here&#039;s my view.  It removed my pain which had me on the verge of suicide, sitting on the foot of my bed in tears.  It removed all my pain, 100% with absolutely no side effects at all.  No dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, withdrawal problems, tolerance  buildup at all.  Taking for 8 years now 100mg at 6:00am and 100mg at 6:00pm every day.  A miracle to me!""",9
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on lamictal for about a month now. I started on 50mg, 2nd week 75mg, and 3rd week 100mg at night. 1st 2 days in on 50 I felt borderline aggressive and very irritable. This evened out on the 3rd day and I began to feel very motivated and able to think clearly. I still experienced a few depressive episodes, but I hope to get onto an antidepressant once my dose is high enough. I&#039;ve began taking 25mg in the AM to slowly move up to 100 in the AM on top of my 100 at night. Since I have, my memory, attention, and anxiety have worsened and other side effects have been sweating, raised heart rate, some trouble sleeping, and slight photo-sensitivity. Most of these have subsided as I adjust so overall it&#039;s best to stick with it for a bit.""",6
Pristiq,Depression,"""My doctor prescribed Pristiq 6 months ago for major depressive disorder with anxiety. I have been on several different antidepressants but this one took the longest to work. It took 6 weeks. I was nauseated for the first month. It finally started working and I felt less depressed but lately I am very moody and irritable. Sometimes all I want to do is stay in bed and at other times I&#039;m up all night (like now - it&#039;s 3:55am). Can&#039;t take this any more. Good luck.""",5
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""Started Saxenda with dr.-approved diet 9/9/16.  By 11/30/16 was down 26lbs and happy.  Have been maintaining between 1-3 lbs of goal.  Still taking daily injections.  My insurance didn&#039;t cover &amp; I paid $1300 the 1st time.  Thankfully we learned my husband&#039;s insurance covers so now I pay a $35 co-pay. I&#039;ve never reached max dose of 3 mg.  Gone to 2.4 mg a few times but get nauseous.  Dose alternates between 1.2 mg - 1.8 mg.  Cravings are much easier to control.  I eat what I want, but in moderation.  Haven&#039;t stayed consistent with exercise though except for walking.  Before Saxenda I tried everything for 4 years but nothing worked and I gained more weight each time.  I&#039;m age 51, 4&#039;11, 110.""",3
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My 6 yr old son started on an ADHD regimen about 8 months ago.  We started on Concerta, increased dosage 3 different times, and switched to Vyvanase.  We have increased it to 30 mg and it still is not working.  However, now the moodiness, extreme sadness, and impulsiveness is much worse while on Vyvanse.  I really am considering just dealing with the ADHD without medicinal help.  I feel sorry for the little guy.  This is not what I want him to be like.""",1
Bactrim,Acne,"""I was struggling with really bad cystic hormonal acne and frequent white heads. I looked horrible and felt depressed inside. I couldn&#039;t look anyone in the eyes. Acne has really sunked my self esteem. When I was on this for a week.. let me just say.. This works!! (For me) I tried everything there is.. Proactiv, antibiotics, eating better, going to a naturalist. This pill, in 2-3months, cleared my acne. It was like a miracle. I&#039;m so thankful for it and it only costs me $8. It saved my life basically!!""",4
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;ve always had acne, ever since puberty started!! I broke out really badly at the start of this year probably because I went on a &quot;TRY EVERYTHING&quot; rampage and destroyed my own skin:( but yea it was one of the lowest points for me in terms of my self-esteem and confidence. I really hated looking at myself and I was so depressed. Anyway I was prescribed Differin by my dermatologist.  Alas, after many painful months of breaking out, my skin slowly but surely cleared up. I would say, the initial months were VERY TOUGH but don&#039;t give up! BE PATIENT and you will see your skin transform! Give if at least 3 months""",4
Seroquel,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder 10 years ago (recently found out it is actually PTSD/c-PTSD) and I was started on 1200mg of serquel. I was a zombie!  I didn&#039;t want to do anything but sleep. I was so tired all day. One day after taking my medication and then sleeping 10 hours, I then got in my car and was driving somewhere and feel asleep at the wheel. I total my car but luckily I wasn&#039;t hurt and no one else was involved. I lost my job. The &quot;best&quot; part though was the 110 pound weight gain I had in less then a year of taking this poison.  I&#039;ve been off of the crap for about 3 years now but still can&#039;t drop the weight it caused me to gain.  Please be careful if considering taking this drug it almost ruined my life.""",6
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I was just prescribed Adipex today (FINALLY). Long story short - I was about 30 pounds overweight in 2002 when my husband was deployed to the war. I decided t use that time to LOSE WEIGHT. I got the meds, and in 5 months I had already lost 55  pounds! I was thrilled. I wouldn&#039;t send my husband a photo of me, because I wanted to surprise him. Boy was he! He stopped in his tracks and mouthed %u1E84OW Then three years later I got a brain tumor. The cancer medications, and the steroids that I had to take to try to control the tumor, made me GAIN it all back PLUS another 45 pounds! (Plus I lost my hair). Well fast forward about 8 years, I have lost 55 lbs. Doc prescribed Adipex to help get the rest off! Wish me luck!""",3
Paxil,Anxiety,"""I started Paxil 1 week ago and I have only had one little attack. It has given me more energy for work! But I do find myself going home after work and taking a nap! The only bad thing about it so far is I&#039;m clenching my jaw a lot causing my back teeth to hurt and can&#039;t really chew that well, may be why I am losing weight also! But it has made my life a lot easier so far! From before I&#039;d have to miss work because of my anxiety!""",7
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I am 19 years old with severe acne. I took this when I was around 16 or 17 for about 3 months. I was never happier with how my face looked I had absolutely not one pimple after taking this for 3 months BUT I stopped taking it because I was happy with the results when I was supposed to take it for 9 months. Don&#039;t do that! Because my acne came back almost just as bad. I hear if you take it for the full amount it works though. I honestly had no real side effects. I think because I only took it for 3 months.""",4
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the skyla iud put in december 13th (i believe that&#039;s the day). I have a very high pain tolerance, over 16 piercings, have even pierced myself a few times, and the pain from having this inserted was easily a 10/10. I was crying. I was telling them to take it out of me it hurt so bad, but honestly immediately after it was completely in the pain went away SO FAST. I had terrible cramping that day and the day after, but I only bled about 3 days once it was put in. I spotted pretty irregularly the first month, and when it came to the time my period was coming, I bled a full 8 days very heavily. Since my period has ended i haven&#039;t spotted once, and I haven&#039;t had any cramps. I would definitely go through the pain again!! best birth control!!""",8
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I just had Nexplanon placed 6/4/13. The process was simple enough, the only pain I felt was the numbing process, then just tugging sensations as the Doctor placed the insert. Where my arm was cut has been slow to heal, but it is getting there. My biggest scare was that it would come out, it is still there so far! I haven&#039;t had any adverse side effects, only itching which I assume is my arm healing. I have been on pills since I was 15, so 16 years later I am excited to try a new method that I don&#039;t have to think about everyday. A friend recommended it to me and I would definitely recommend it anyone!""",8
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""I started taking zaleplon after finding that my previous sleeping pill (trazodone) made me sleepy well into the next day. Zaleplon has a much shorter half life than trazodone and it helps with falling asleep. The way my doctor described it was that it would ease my mind so I could fall asleep versus making me just drowsy. The first few weeks I fell asleep instantly. However, after being on zaleplon for awhile, I noticed that in the morning I had taken more pills (2 or 3) without remembering I had. I live alone, so I know I was the only one that could have taken them. I also did dishes and took trash out in my sleep. I now take a lower dose and haven&#039;t had the same issues since. Great sleeping pill but make sure you start on a low dose.""",0
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I had trouble functioning during the day because I couldn&#039;t fall asleep until 1 or 2 am, then had to get up at 6 am.  My doctor prescribed 10 mg Ambien (not CR) but because I&#039;m small I decided to cut one in half the first night.  I was able to sleep soundly almost immediately after my head hit the pillow and I slept all night.  That was about three years ago and I am still taking my half pill per night and sleeping well.   I have occasional times (maybe once every two months) that I don&#039;t sleep well with them, but I don&#039;t blame the pill for that.  Follow the directions, if you don&#039;t it isn&#039;t the fault of the drug, it&#039;s your own fault.""",0
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""Been on this medicine for almost 2 years. Went to max dose of 60mg. Did NOTHING for my depression, anxiety, back pain, or Fibromyalgia. Completely useless medication. And whats worse? You got it- WITHDRAWAL. I have been to the ER 4 times now since withdrawing from 60mg down to 30mg, so I am only half way weened off as of now. Extreme vertigo, nausea, dizziness, brain zaps, edge of panic all day into night. Worst experience I have every had after trying different anti-depressants for the last 7 years. Gave this medicine the last chance. After I get off it, may take me a year or more to ween the rest of the way down.""",7
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I have been on and off of phendimetrizine 35 mg for three years. The first 2 months I ever took them I lost 50 pounds. Until the past year I had a great experience with it... although I would yo-yo if I came off the pills and diet, they were extremely effective while doing it correctly. I would STRONGLY recommend never combining the pills with alcohol, too much caffeine, or cigarettes. The last year has actually driven me to be very hesitant to use the medicine. I am truly nervous of having a heart attack. I became very nervous, anxious, experienced high blood pressure, and heart palpitations. It&#039;s scary. Just be very careful because you will eventually think you need these pills to lose weight, and that is terrible. Be careful!""",2
Wellbutrin XL,ADHD,"""I absolutely loved this medication.  Within a few short weeks, for the first time ever I was able to complete tasks I never thought I&#039;d finish.  In one day I excitedly completed 6 projects that had been sitting around unfinished for months.  Sadly for me, I got a horrible rash and realized I was allergic to it.  I&#039;ve tried a few other medications, but for me, nothing&#039;s ever come close to being as effective.""",1
Tramadol,Pain,"""I was diagnosed with tendonitis and arthritis in the neck and was prescribed tramadol. It has really worked for me. I mostly take it at night, 1 tablet, to get some relief and some sleep for a few hours without pain. I used to take Percocet when I had a herniated disc in my back and although I got some relief, I was severely constipated, which I never am because I have colitis. After 2 bottles of stool softeners, a bottle of Metamucil, I was finally able to go. I got an intestinal infection because I couldn&#039;t go and I swore I&#039;d never take Percocet again. Tramadol is strong and can have side effects such as stomach cramps and nausea but only if taken on an empty stomach. It has to be taken with food to avoid the side effects.""",9
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using tretinoin in the 0.1 gel form for almost 2 years and let me tell you it is possibly the best skin product you will ever own. //The beginning is hard, naturally the skin needs time to adjust so for the first few months of treatment you will experience a lot of redness, patchiness and obviously flaking and you may also experinece periods of very ugly break outs if u have many clogged pores hiding under the surface as the retin a will exfoliate the skin and slowly &#039;activate&#039; ur pores to enable them to unclog without the need for manual extraction and without scarring. the key with retin a is patience, SPF and lots of moisturizing. do not quit before ur skin gets better and resist the temptation to extract acne yourself. G Luck.""",4
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""Fluoxetine/prozac 20mg for depression/anxiety.
Within 4 hours of taking it at 4pm I truely felt better by 8 pm and happier not sure it was the meds at first or believing it to be working?,had done a lot research before taking it positives and negatives so have an open mind about prozac,certainly felt better quickly after initail dose!.
First 2 weeks slight headaches,bit spaced initially,groggy,dry mouth,difficult concentrate,but I did feel like this whilst depressed!
Now 3rd week its kicked in after 2 weeks and I feel calmer relaxed able to think clearly not foggy mind feel focused happier motivated.
This drug has dealt with anxiety&amp;depression,100%,I was worrying everything,sleep is OK now,no sexual dysfunction yet!.
Good luck.""",5
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I am usually not the type to comment or write a review I feel so lost, helpless and alone about this subject. I decided to go on some method of birth control because I was having abnormal bleeding since October 2014 (two times a month, week long heavy bleeding). I got Depo shot in Feb. and wouldn&#039;t stop bleeding. Then my doc decided I should try IUD Mirena in April. I literally bleed (Feb-End of July) non stop! It stopped for 3 weeks in August .... So far I&#039;ve been on my period since start of Sept! I see no sign of stopping. I&#039;ve never been pregnant and the insertion process was painful it put me to tears. Worst cramp I&#039;ve ever had and that lasted all day. Occasionally I get sharp cramping that last 5-10minutes. :( I feel helpless.""",8
Vicodin,Pain,"""Had lower back surgery in 2000ish. Was taking 750mg before and after surgery. Help with dealing with pain and got me back to work as a roofer. Recently my neck had been giving me problems an a MRI revealed disc herniations, bulging disc, degenerative disc disease, flattening of my left spinal cord and a hamangioma, with pain and numbness in my left arm/hand, neck. I&#039;ve been treating with 500mg vicodin &amp; 15mg Ms-Contin. Brings pain level down to a tolerable level but as always, somedays are better than others.""",9
Pristiq,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Pristiq for a week and already feel like a new person. I was EXTREMELY hesitant to take the medication because I had tried other antidepressants in the past without success plus there seems to be nothing but negative written about the drugs. I take no other medications and am a healthy 42 year old. I had a few days of nausea which was relieved mostly by taking the medication in the morning with food. I have a little dry mouth and use the bathroom a little less but otherwise have no side effects. I feel like a film was lifted off me. It&#039;s hard to explain. I hope to continue to feel as balanced as I do now. I&#039;m taking this for anxiety and dysthmic depression. The drug company offers assistance with co-payment. """,5
Sronyx,Birth Control,"""My experience started out pretty good with sronyx and to be honest the bad trickled in so subtly that I didn&#039;t even realize anything had gone wrong until it hit me full force.
My periods used to be 2-4 months apart, but extremely painful when they finally hit. 
Sronyx eventually started to fix that, although my first 2 packs I bled constantly all the way through until it stopped.
I went from an average 76 day cycle to now a 17 day cycle and every period that number gets lower.
My anxiety got out of control to the point where I needed professional help and I became physically ill with migraines and nausea that required hospital.
I have stopped taking the pill today and will be seeing my doctor first thing.
It&#039;s not worth it.""",8
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication has been a real life-saver. I had struggled with heavy depressions interspersed with hypomania for a few years before I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar 2 Disorder, for which I was prescribed this. The initial 50mg did nothing except be an overrated sleep pill, but the boost to 300mg for bipolar depression helped begin to mellow me out, and a few weeks later I was starting to experience a life free of devastating mood swings. I&#039;ve read horror stories online, but I experienced nothing of the sort (actually *lost* weight in the past few months). It&#039;s a shame there&#039;s risks with long-term use, I would happily take this forever otherwise - these past few months have been nice and happy and productive for me thanks to this.""",6
Budeprion XL,ADHD,"""I have been taking Wellbutrin for 8 plus years. Then went to SR, then XL.  Helped with my ADHD with Adderall too.   Went off for about a year and started back. 
To save money went to generic 150mg XL - they were great.  When Dr. suggested increasing back to 300mg daily (as previously) I agreed. I started taking the 300mg XL generics - the symptoms returned.  I noticed when I opened the bottle there as a noxious odor given off.  After 4 weeks couldn&#039;t stand the smell and returned the rest of the pills to my pharmacy.  They replaced them and said they would look into the problem.  The 150 mg SR generics stink too. Only the 150mg XL generics don&#039;t.""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""The medication itself works well enough, but my main issue with this medication is that the price keeps going up. I am using the savings program and they keep lowering the amount the plan covers. When I started this medication I only paid around $50 a month. Now after a few months I am paying over $90 a month. It&#039;s ridiculous they keep lowering the amount their &quot;savings&quot; plan covers. For this reason I will be switching to something else. I have several friends &amp; acquaintances that also use Contrave (some at my recommendation) and their costs also went drastically up. Almost all of them will be consulting their doctors to get on something else. It&#039;s not worth to start taking something only to have the costs skyrocket to make more money.""",2
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I am 75 year old and have taken Clonazepam 0.5 mg tablet for about 4 years for restless legs and insomnia. I take 1/2 of the tablet every night, along with vitamin D and magnesium &amp; Aleve for arthritis pain. It has been very effective for me, it lets me sleep with no hangover but I do have vivid dreams every night, not nightmares though.. On occasion I have taken a full tablet but I keep them cut in half and usually only need the 1/2 dose. My new doctor is taking me off of them and putting me on Mirapex for restless legs and melatonin to sleep. Melatonin has never helped before but I will try again.""",0
Tenuate,Obesity,"""I have been using Tenuate 75mg for 4 months along with a modified high protein/low fat diet substituting 2 meals a day with a protein shake. I have lost 41 lbs and gone from a size 20W to a size 14!  I am very happy with my weight loss and how this drug makes me feel!  I have no jitters or racing heart and can tell a difference if I forget to take it.  On days I forget I feel like I&#039;m searching for something to put in my mouth and have to make a truly conscious effort to drink more water and not succumb to my cravings/urges to eat anything and everything!  Days when I take it I almost never think about eating and have to use the alarms set on my blackberry to remind me to eat every 4 hours!  I have a lot more energy and no trouble sleeping.""",2
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I was initially diagnosed with ADHD-combined hyperactive and implulsive when I was 16. Up until that point, I struggled with my attention issues and excessive energy and it became increasingly difficult to cope with the symptoms as I got older. My doctor prescribed me Concerta 54 Mg once a day. I immediately noticed significant improvements. I was able to think more clearly and communicate coherently. At the same time I noticed that I had a better ability to control my attention and remain focused over a more prolonged period of time. My grades improved and my relationship with friends and family became much better.

I&#039;m now 26 and still taking the medication. The therapeutic effects are still evident.""",1
Seroquel,Insomnia,"""I am a 38 year old male. I have been deployed to Iraq 3 times and have very bad post traumatic stress disorder and could not sleep due to very bad dreams so my DR put me on 50mg Seroquel taken once at bed time and I sleep very well, in fact without it I do not sleep. I still have bad dreams (well that&#039;s what I am told) but I do not remember them and sleep right through them. I would recommend Seroquel to anyone who might be having the same problem that I was.""",0
Morphine,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been taking Avinza for a few years and it has changed my life.  I have chronic back pain and have had 1 unsuccessful surgery.  I will not go through that again just to be disappointed. I started with a dose of 120 mg and have been able to reduce that to only 30 mg over the past 18 months.  I added in a regular visit to a chiropractor and had acupuncture.  All together these things have made my quality of life so much better.   Soon I hope to be off of it totally.""",9
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I&#039;m a 47-year-old female and was born with spina bifida, also my spinal cord is tethered. I have scoliosis as well. I don&#039;t even remember a day of not being in pain. I have been on just about all the typical narcotic medications. In June 2011 I finally had to quit my job after 24 years because of the severe pain. My family doctor prescribed Nucynta until I can get an appointment with PM. I&#039;ve been on Nucynta for 3 days, and even though the pain relief seems better than any of the other medications, the side effects are making me evaluate about whether to stay on it or not. I&#039;ve been getting waves of nausea, headaches, dizziness and feeling as if I am overheated. I&#039;m going to keep taking it and hope that the side effects will subside.""",9
Methadone,Pain,"""Methadone can be very useful for some types of chronic pain.  For those who need larger doses of narcotics, methadone does not cause tolerance like morphine or oxycodone so you do not have to keep raising the dose to keep your pain in control.  It does take time to kick in so be patient.  Oxys or MS can be given to help till Methadone kicks in.  Any narcotic can have side effects like constipation.  A good doc will help you PREVENT such problems.  As for comments that kick backs and conspiring with drug companies, we are under intense monitoring as some people sell the drugs to others or overdose and die.  We must see patients often to prevent problems like this.  If not, we loose our license or get sued.  It&#039;s called good medical care.""",9
Paxil,Depression,"""This was the best medicine that covered a wide variety of mental disorders. I took this pill 60mg for 6 years. I was then hospitalized on an unrelated matter and the doctor had me taken off of this, abruptly. That was the wrong thing to do, I fell into a deep depression that stayed out of control for 3 weeks. The longest 3 weeks of my life, I could not function at all. BE CAREFUL WHEN STOPPING THIS PILL!!!!!!!!!""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""First update on my lileta since my initial post on 8/13/16. Pain has gone away totally. No cramps. Some light red blood from the uterus lining beginning to thin out. Panty liners work well for this. Cons so far- mood swings. They come out of nowhere and I can be fine one second and ready to fight strangers the next. I&#039;ve become more confrontational. Pros- I&#039;ve had sex once since I got the iud, it was fine, normal, no one felt anything. So far so good.""",8
Bupropion,Depression,"""I was under severe anxiety and depression from intolerable conditions at a hostile job for years until I was so sick their antics pushed me to go. I then went into a deep depression sleeping a ton having lack of energy feeling like nothing was ever going to be right again. I withdrew myself from family, friends and activities. I finally decided to go on Wellbutrin XL after talking it over with my psych because I have multiple health problems and couldn&#039;t take other kinds of antidepressants. It saved my life. No weight gain. I&#039;m focused alert not depressed happy and have a job again. I am visiting family and friends too. Not sleeping a lot anymore. Try it.""",5
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""A Type 2 Diabetic on Belviq (twice a day) for the last 10 weeks.
I used to Live to Eat and now I Eat to Live. Belviq has given me the full control of what to eat, when to eat and how much to eat at every meal.
Fasting Weight this morning was 224.4 Lbs down from 250.8 Lbs on 06/13/13 a 26.4 Lbs Weight Loss = 10.5%. Was able to reduce my Humalog 75/25 Insulin intake from 100 to 20 Units a day, an 80% reduction in insulin use. My Blood Glucose was also reduced from 164 to about 114 mg/dL.
Simply put, my experience on Belviq the last 10 weeks has been nothing short of AMAZING. I feel blessed that finally there is something that works incredibly well for me where I can manage my type 2 diabetes to a point where no longer need to take any more Daily Insulin Shots.""",2
Restoril,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed this medication yesterday after struggling to sleep when my Ambien became ineffective.  When I took it, I waited 1.5 hours to feel sleepy and I didn&#039;t.  I then took a 2nd pill (30mg total).  After 3 hours time it still hadn&#039;t worked for me.  I was in bed, ready to sleep, no real distractions.  I finally had to take Ambien on top of it and then I felt a bit tired and struggled all night.  Not sure if this is a medication that takes time to work, but it didn&#039;t touch me at all.""",0
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I have crps I developed after 2 major shoulder and bicep surgeries in less then 3 months.  I am on fentanyl patches,  oxycodone, topamax, baclofen and cymbalta for pain.  I was taking ambien at night to sleep.  It was giving me 4 hours of restful peaceful sleep if i did not move.  ( Moving my shoulder causes severe pain). Dr. was concerned about the sleep walking caused by ambien.  She wanted me to try this I have had horrible nights, a terrible drugged feeling.  I am aware the world exists all hours of the night.   It is causing headaches in my front forehead area.  The headache hangs on till well after lunch most days.  I actually decided last night I would rather deal with my pain 24 hours a day with no relief then deal with the effects.""",0
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I feel the need to write a review of this medication as I am currently experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms from missing one dose. There was a mix up with a new insurance company and I unfortunately had to miss yesterdays dose. I have never felt this way after missing one dose of a medication and I have taken several different antidepressants over the last 10 years. I have the sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and I have been crying uncontrollably all day. I did have benefits from taking this medication for the past three years but I worry about continuing to take it any longer.""",5

Contrave,Obesity,"""I was prescribed this RX because I can&#039;t lose weight, even after following a diet and exercising. I&#039;m starting on my 4th week and I am thoroughly disappointed thus far. It hasn&#039;t suppressed my appetite or controlled my cravings at ALL. Indeed, I have GAINED 5lbs since starting! Also, this week I am having pounding headaches that won&#039;t go away, as well as severe constipation. Most disappointed, as this RX was NOT covered by my insurance and it was expensive.""",2
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I had 2 panic attacks in my entire life. I went to a Doctor and was given Xanax at half mg to take immediately and 6 hrs later. It worked and I thought I would keep some handy for any possible future attacks. He prescribed 0.25mg pills 3 times a day. I looked it up on the internet and didn&#039;t like the information on addiction. I went to my Doctor when I got back home and he prescribed Ativan. I believe Xanax should be used only when having a panic attack and not as a maintenance drug.""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have never experienced any hallucinogenic side effects from this drug, but I admit I&#039;ve developed a nasty dependency to 100 mgs/night. It is the only sleep aid that doesn&#039;t give me cotton mouth or drowsiness the next day and works like a charm every single time.  Nothing even comes close to its effectiveness. Note:  It IS imperative that you take it at once you are in bed and ready to sleep.  After that you aren&#039;t going anywhere, no sleep walking, driving or binge eating.""",0
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""After the arduous task of getting pre-authorization for this drug, I paid $60 and it is not helping. I suffer from chronic insomnia and was looking for something to help me sleep more soundly and to wake up restored. Ambien and Trazadone where my go to combo and worked well for me aside from the restorative part. Hence, the move to Belsomra. I started with 10mg  and it did nothing. Then I tried 20mg and it did assist with falling asleep eventually (at least 2 hours), but not staying asleep. I sleep off and on with this stuff and the dreams are pretty consistent, definitely not REM sleep. To anyone thinking of trying this drug, I&#039;d say save your money and keep looking.""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on Saxenda for 4 weeks after trying unsuccessfully for about 12 months to lose any weight at all. I&#039;ve lost 6 pounds, which is awesome for me. I just started the 3.0 dose this week, so I haven&#039;t even been at full efficacy. The side effects have been mild and tolerable... a little nausea after each bump in dose, some heartburn, and fatigue. They seem to be getting better the longer I am on the medicine. I got a discount card from the Saxenda website that keeps my co-pay at $30.""",2
Tegretol,Bipolar Disorde,"""Well im very impressed and happy others have  Tegretol works, i am adhd and bipolar yup try that on for size its insane. I use to be an extremist of note but tegretol has controlled this and what i like most its not like the other medications it does not put you on just another high or a buzz, you don&#039;t realize what it does but the people around you do. It slows you down to a more controlled state and keeps the depression down. For me combine tegretol with healthy eating no dow etc rice starch, lots of water and gym and youll be sorted no doubt.But always remember like any normal being there are ups and downs and if you realize life is not always peaches and cream, and that you will experience down time, accept  and just let it pass.""",6
Methadose,Pain,"""I have been taking methadone HCL 10 mg tablets for 10 years for chronic pain. I love this medication greatly and yes it&#039;s a lifesaver for sure. I had been on everything from Ultram to Oxy 80. I can tell you that this medication blows them all away. I started out on 3 a day for 8 years and in the last 2 years I have been on 4 a day. My pain is managed to about 96%. It seems to take a really long time for immunity to set in. This is the best pain medicine on the market. """,9
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started Phentermine, prescribed by my primary care physician, and it has been nothing short of amazing in my case.  I started taking it at 372.4 pounds. Within a matter of 4 days of taking the medication I noticed a HUGE change.  This gives me energy, and makes me feel not hungry at all.  In 5 days, I lost  11.3 pounds.  I don&#039;t have any of the nasty side effects that everybody mentions, but medications affect people differently.  I take the Phentermine EVERY day at the SAME time, and am already noticing a difference.  Along with not making you feel hungry, when you do eat, it makes you feel full.  FAST.""",2
Contrave,Obesity,"""At first I was super nauseous on this medicine and would feel lightheaded. But then I realized I was taking my doses too close together. So now I take one at about seven when I wake up and then one at four when I get off work. The first one and I drink a ton of water with and I eat something with it.  After that I haven&#039;t had hardly any problems. I do found myself sweating excessively and a little hard to poop. But other than that it&#039;s amazing I do not crave alcohol or chocolate or ice cream near as much anymore. I think the side effects only last a few weeks. So if you can get through that you&#039;re golden.""",2
Yasmin,Acne,"""I have been taking Yasmin for the past month due to my dermatologist&#039;s recommendation to my mild-severe acne condition. I had never taken any form of birth control before so I had been warned about nausea, headaches etc. However, to this day, I have yet to feel any of those symptoms. I began on the Sunday method and so far I haven&#039;t forgotten a day. However, since the first week, my acne condition has totally accelerated for the worst. Where I used to be clear, I now breakout daily. I continue to wash and treat with my doctor&#039;s recommendation daily/twice daily, and yet no results. It&#039;s aggravating, but I am hopeful that this will only be a phase and soon everything will improve.""",4
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My 11 year old son has ADHD with anxiety disorder.  This medication has helped him manage his anxiety (he is much happier) and he is able to focus better on managing everything from time to his emotions.  He has better stamina mentally and can perform mental tasks for longer periods of time.  He is also acting more mature and being more responsible. He takes 2mg at night 1 hour before bed along with gummy melatonin to help him sleep.  He sleeps well and feels good during the day.  Overall this medication has helped him a great deal.  It&#039;s like it took him out of his anxious rut and gives him a better outlook.""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I had found myself spacing out and getting very easily distracted in school. I would always talk and anything from a noise to something moving out the window would distract me and get me off task somehow. I also had trouble staying focused on assignments that took a descent amount of time to finish. I finally told my psychiatrist about it and he gave me Vyvanse 30mg. It helped me out A LOT. I stayed focused, and if I started an assignment I finished it but he gave me a script for 1 a day every morning but I found myself taking 2 a day sometimes so he gave me the 60mg Vyvanse. So now I take one 60mg Vyvanse a day and am fine. I don&#039;t get distracted anymore like I did. I find myself getting all my work done then talking instead of talking 1st.""",1
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I stated getting terrible acne since I stopped taking the pill 6 months ago. My normal cleanser and pimple routine wasn&#039;t working, and mostly made the acne worse. My GP prescribed 50mg of Doxycycline once daily which didn&#039;t seem to work. Although the Dr told me the acne might get worse before it gets better, I decided to go back and ask for a stronger medication as it got ALOT worse in the first two weeks of being on 50mg. I was prescribed 100mg once daily instead of going onto another medication. I&#039;m now 2 months in and I&#039;ve started noticing a huge change. I&#039;ve also changed my makeup to mineral which has helped ALOT! Don&#039;t forget that Doxy makes your skin worse before it gets better but don&#039;t give up! It works!!""",4
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had acne for two years (currently in year 9) and have tried all creams, but the creams never used to work for me since it wasn&#039;t my skin that caused the pimples, apparently there was just too much hormone production, so the Dr. prescribed me with 50mg of Doxycycline about two and a half weeks ago. The first week there weren&#039;t any signs of success, the second week it just seemed to get worse, (which everyone says is the side affect of this drug) but i haven&#039;t experienced the third week of being on this drug so i just hope my pimples clear up.""",4
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m taking Duloxetine 20mg per day for anxiety and minor depression. I have taken this med for almost two months and keep a daily journal. As a &#039;blind study&#039; I started this drug without my wife&#039;s knowledge. I noticed a decrease in my overall anxiety in ten (10) days and my wife mentioned my calmness in two weeks. I am a 70 year old male and I supplement Duloxetine with Buspar on an &#039;as needed&#039; basis for anxiety. The Duloxetine seems to smooth things out without the numbing effect of a benzodiazepine. I&#039;m on the minimum available dosage and will soon ask my PCP to up my dosage to 40mg per day. There have been absolutely no bad side effects from the drug.""",7
Lexapro,Depression,"""I have been on Lexapro once daily in the morning since 2006. I took it in 2004 but had to stop when I got pregnant. I suffer from cyclothymia, which is a bipolar spectrum disorder that includes chronic depression, anxiety, mood swings and irritability. Lexapro is a great medicine for those who it works for. Little side effects. I currently take 30mg Lexapro. I started taking Wellbutrin SR 100mg about 5 months ago to help me with my loss of motivation and inability to get out of bed in the morning (I want to sleep a lot). I still have some irritability and mood swings so my doctor gave me Seroquel XR 50mg to try 3 hours prior to bedtime beginning tonight.""",5
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I started contrave on Feb 5, 2016. It took me a minute before I actually began to use the medication because I was nervous of the side effects.  During that time I weighed 240 pound wearing a size 18 pant size.  After speaking with my physician who&#039;s also a weigh specialist informed me that the side effects will be minor and will not last long.  Once I began the medication, taking one a day for the 1st week and 2 for 2nd; increasing the dosage until I was on 2 in the morning and 2 at night.  I did suffer mild headaches and dry mouth during the first 2 weeks it went away and I have been doing fine ever since. As of Dec 27, 2016, I can joyously say I am 201 pounds wearing a size12 pants.""",3
Sertraline,Depression,"""I started taking Zoloft when I was 16. I was sent to the hospital twice for suicidal actions and my doctors upped my initial dose from 25mg to 200mg. I was supposed to go up to 300mg but I was really sick of the dosage being upped and nothing happening. To be completely honest, it took 2-3 months to kick in for me. I&#039;ve been diagnosed with psychotic depression/possibly schizophrenia spectrum. Now that the medicine has had some time to work into my system, I&#039;ve felt much better. Not 100% my old self, but capable of functioning and taking care of myself. I wasn&#039;t able to get out of bed for days on end at my worst. The side effects are totally manageable and worth it. My psychosis apparently calms down when I&#039;m feeling less down which is a relief.""",5
Implanon,Birth Control,"""My first experience was fine, no bleeding, no pregnancy but when I had a second implant put in place it was a horrible experience. In the beginning I had extremely bad pains and really heavy bleeding I couldn&#039;t do anything this carried on for a year with only a couple days break, my mood swings were constant and lost my appetite completely. I was so exhausted by this that I lost 2 stone and became anemic. I went to the Drs and found out that when I get it removed it would take my body about 7 months to go back to normal, although I never got pregnant I don&#039;t want to go through this experience again.""",8
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""My husband just started taking Lithium last week and we both have seen a HUGE difference. Yesterday he told me he feels &#039;fine&#039; and not like he doesn&#039;t want to be on this earth any longer. He&#039;s been on multiple antidepressants over the years...none of which have worked. His new psychiatrist seems to have found the right drug. I hope he continues to improve. We both thought Lithium was for people with very serious disorders, which we didn&#039;t consider him part of that group. No matter...if it works it works! Take care.""",6
Concerta,ADHD,"""Unbelievable! I think and concentrate much better , focus, it does effect for men a little down below, but it makes you focus so you are very hi libido. Men know what I am talking about. It is great for that you mind does not wonder.  I&#039;ve only been on it for a week, it works immediately. And yes you worry because you can see things so good, and you are not used to it. So I get scared, that should go away. try it. you don&#039;t like, try something else, controlled substance, hard to get. Psychiatry will get this for you, and you need prior authorization depending on insurance.""",1
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;ve always had really mild breakouts ever since college started, but I gradually lost them through Clearasil and St. Ives. But now that I&#039;m in my junior year, I&#039;m breaking out twice as much. My dermatologist prescribed me Differin (0.01 cream adapalene), and it was quite pricey because I was taking it alongside clindamycin, which I only put on my pimples whereas I used a pea-sized amount of Differin on my entire face. I&#039;m currently on my third day of Differin and Clindamycin, and I have been experiencing skin peelings on my nose and a little bit of redness and tenderness. There have been more breakouts (I now have 6 pimples), and I hope it gets worse before it gets better now that it&#039;s still holiday break.""",4
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I was always smart, but my career has accelerated rapidly thanks to this drug.  I have the stamina and focus that I just would not have otherwise.  I had trouble  with concentration in college and it wasn&#039;t until I started taking vyvanse that I finally was able to complete tasks in a reasonable amount of time.   My GPA went from a 3.3 to a 4.0. 

 All the positives aside,  I missed the pill today and basically ate the entire house.  Withdrawal effects are Brutal.""",1
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Was given this pill by my doc for insomnia. I took the pill at 10:30 pm, was very drowsy by 11:15 pm but was also unable to fall asleep. The severe drowsiness lasted about 2 hours, yet I was unable to sleep. I got up to move around until I thought I could sleep, and felt off balance and mentally a bit out of it. Finally fell asleep at about 1:30 am, and woke at 7:30 am feeling awful. Still at 9 am I feel a bit out of it, but most of all I am absolutely exhausted. The sleep wasn&#039;t good, in fact it was a terrible experience. I will not take this ever again.""",0
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve only been on Belviq for a few days, but I&#039;m already seeing it work! My appetite is curved and I&#039;m rarely hungry. I&#039;ve always struggled with never having that &quot;full&quot; feeling and always wanting to eat and eat, but with Belviq, I don&#039;t seem to struggle with it anymore. 
I&#039;ve seen some people who don&#039;t seem to respond to the medicine, which is unfortunate. However, some advice I have. If you take this medicine with an optimistic attitude, and you&#039;re conscience about what you&#039;re doing (eating habits), then I think most of the time, you&#039;ll be successful. It&#039;s not a miracle drug that just melts the weight off. You have to put forth the effort to listen to your mind more and not just your want to eat. 
Good luck!!""",3
Butrans,Pain,"""When the doctor gave me these patches I had a a &quot;yeah right&quot; attitude.  I am  stunned! I applied the first patch and 3 days later I had significant pain relief! I just applied my 2nd patch and I am able to resume doing a lot of things I haven&#039;t done in years. I had side effects at first, sleepiness, shakiness, and severe nausea but they passed within the first week. I am amazed and pleased at the effectiveness of these patches.""",9
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I was told by my doctor to take the doxycycline 100mg once a day for 3 months. So far it has been 3 weeks and I think my acne is getting worst. The first week my acne seemed to be improving. That was until the 2nd week it started getting worst. I&#039;m starting to think it might be my period causing me to break out again. So I&#039;m hoping I will see an improvement when its over. I have had no bad side effects which is great. After reading positive feedback on this I am really hoping to see a huge difference!! BE PATIENT""",4
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I love Klonopin. When I was going through an extremely hard custody case with my ex husband, my doctor prescribed the Klonopin. She scheduled it up to 3 times a day.  I used it too. It helped me face my fears and stand up for myself for once. Once that was over she scheduled it on 1.0mg as needed up to.3 time&#039;s a day. I still have the script. I do use the Klonopin only when I&#039;m in a situation that I need help relaxing. I know I need it at those times. When I take it, I would feel great. If I didn&#039;t need it but thought I did, all it would do is make me tired. It&#039;s been 3 years of PRN Klonopin &amp; I know when I need it and when I don&#039;t. For those who feel this could be abused, my response is if the person really needs it, Misuse wouldn&#039;t happen""",7
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on Lamictal for three years for Bipolar disorder and Epilepsy, at first as a mood stabilizer and then as an anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer.  It&#039;s been excellent at treating the bipolar issues, virtually eradicating the mood episodes (with the exception of a couple of days of minor hypomania here and there) and helping a little bit with the coexisting anxiety issues.   However, it hasn&#039;t been any good at controlling my seizures, although it&#039;s made them a lot less severe than they were before I went on higher doses of Lamictal.  I haven&#039;t had any major side effects, or any at all outside of an increased sensitivity to rashes.""",6
Amphetamine,ADHD,"""My 7 year old daughter is severe ADHD.  Prior to Dyanavel XR, our best experience was with 30 mg of adderall XR.  But that had a profound effect on her appetite and ability to interact with other people.  We tried concerta which left her very defiant, Focalin and Vyvance were completely ineffective.  We tried Dyanavel for the first time one months ago.  I can&#039;t believe the difference.  She has an appetite, she socializes, she has a personality, she stays in her seat at school and actually works in her assignments.  After 4 days on this medication, her teacher called me and asked what had changed because she couldn&#039;t believe the difference. The only downfall is nighttime.  She consistently wakes up around 4-5 am with dreams.""",1
Pristiq,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on medication like : Remeron, Tegretol, etc for years. I heard about this medicine and asked my doctor and he prescribed it to me (50 mg).
First week..fine, second week.. The worst time of my life. I felt over depressed, my body sore, had panic attacks, felt extremely aggressive. I ended up in hospital, and this great doctor told me that 50 mg is the initial dose but it&#039;s not right because this drug is highly concentrated. I nearly had an overdose bcause of the 50 mg! So as the psychiatrist from the hospital told me to take just 25mg, I now feel alive and happy again.""",5
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I am 25 years old 5ft 9in and weighed 262lbs when I started Tenuate. I have been on it for 2 weeks now. I have not weighed yet but I have to make myself eat at first I was counting calories but couldn&#039;t eat more than 900 calories a day and that was eating 5 times a day so I just eat a little here and there. I have only experienced dry mouth. I am very hopeful I need rid of this weight maybe Tenuate will do it.""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Now available in Aust :) I received the first month free from my GP (provide by the drug rep). Think it will be around $300/month and can get 30% covered by my private health insurance.I have been on the lowest dose for 4 days and have already lost 3kg! I started at 124kg. Only mild nausea in the second day. Sugar cravings GONE!! And I had a sugar addiction! You do need to eat small amounts every 3/4hours. I have more energy, I&#039;m sleeping better, but conversely I feel tired at times during the day but probably because of the sugar come-down.  I have combined with a low cal diet, so far so good, no exercise (yet). I am interested to know if this will be sustained and if there will be any reaction to higher dosage, will keep you posted.""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I&#039;m a 25 year old female and I suffered terrible acne for a long time, then it went away for a few years. Suddenly back in September 2016 I started to break out again in those painful cysts around my jawline, where I had never broke out before. Spiro helped me many years before so I started taking it again. First week 25 mg and then 50 mg. Had the notorious &quot;Initial Breakout&quot; but after that cleared up (took 2 months) I&#039;ve been good ever since! It&#039;s nice not waking up each morning to find new painful cysts under my chin! Love it. It has caused some dizziness but I&#039;ll take that over a pimply, painful face any day. Be patient, this drug takes a while. Worth it though.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""So I have always been a big girl! I have 3 kids and with each pregnancy there was added weight that just carried over and you know how the story goes...I pushed myself and my wants and needs to the side and took care of everyone but myself. The more weight I put on the more depressed I got. I got to 280lbs!!!! My body was in constant pain and discomfort and I knew I had to stop and do do something about it. I started the pills last year and lost a total of 125lbs!!! Not just the pills but I started the gym, did zumba 3 times a week and started eating good. The pills aren&#039;t the magic fix. They just help you kind of like a kick start. Sure I had side effects!!!! But nothing that would out weight being close to 300lbs.""",3
Silenor,Insomnia,"""I was given a sample pack 3mg Silenor to help with my inability to stay asleep.  I followed the instructions and unfortunately it did not seem to work for me.  It made me very anxious and agitated during the night.  I did sleep but kept waking up.  In the morning I was very groggy and unsteady on my feet.  I felt like I had been drugged and had a minor headache all day.  
I do not think I will take it again as it is obviously not the drug for me.""",0
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""Am 61 male. Tried all SSRI&#039;s and MAOI&#039;s for persistent depression over 9 years. Most recent was Prozac. None of these worked beyond moderate improvement. Depression and anxiety attended me constantly. I used Lorazepam to sleep effectively. I went on Brintellix 10 mg and within 2 weeks felt stable and able to deal with challenging personal setbacks with clarity and resolve. I think that 4 months into it I have found a drug that truly works.""",5
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""After horrible experiences with a multitude of different antidepressants, the realization came upon me that I was possibly bipolar due to a prolonged episode of what I thought could be mania.  Well, my psychiatrist put me on Geodon (40 mg in the evening).  So far, it&#039;s been 2 months and I have had not one depressive or manic episode during this time. The first 2 or 3 days of taking the drug were awful- I had terrible brain fog, and just felt totally whacked-out, but that feeling disappeared after just a few days, so I can&#039;t complain too much.  I&#039;m starting taking an additional 20 mg in the morning to hopefully curb some of my anxiety, so we&#039;ll see how that goes.  As far as psych meds go, this one has reigned far superior so far!""",6
Bupropion,Depression,"""I&#039;m a 19 year old female in college. I started taking Buproprion SR. This really helped me with feeling happier. I&#039;m okay with being alone now, I&#039;m not as sad as I used to be. I&#039;m more optimistic and motivated, unlike I was when I took Cymbalta and Lexapro. It doesn&#039;t cause weight gain like everyone says you do on antidepressants. The orgasms are extremely intense. The only issue with me was 300mg a day gave me excruciating migraines. Now I take 150mg a day and feel fine. """,5
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""I was diagnosed with Celiac&#039;s disease 3 years ago although I probably had it for about 7 years. My body didn&#039;t absorb many nutrients so I had anxiety about everything. I am on high doses of B12 and Vit. D and the doctor
thought I should try Effexor.  I first started on a small dose and then she tried me on 75 mg which is still a small dose. This really works for me. I&#039;m not jittery or have negative thoughts.  I&#039;ve only been on this for 6 months but everything seems okay.""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I started taking Doxycyline this week, and already my skin seems to be getting better. I&#039;m 20, and recently developed bad acne on my back, as well as a mild case on my face. After five days, my skin is clearer. I haven&#039;t had any of the nausea people have mentioned, although I occasionally get cramps if I haven&#039;t eaten. I have noticed that I&#039;m getting sunburnt easier, but that&#039;s nothing a good dose of sunblock can&#039;t remedy.""",4
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""My son was so hyper that he couldn&#039;t even sit still to eat.  I would like to respond to the person who questioned her thin 6 year old being put on this medicine.  My son was actually able to put on some weight as he was able to focus and finish his meals.  Within a year he was at a normal weight for his height.  My son&#039;s doctor was able to explain that people with ADD or ADHD do not abuse this drug because it has the opposite affect on them than people without the disorder.""",1
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I had gained a bit of weight during Menopause (about 20 lbs.) I am 5&#039;3&quot; and I now weigh 140lbs. I did get down to 135lbs but have gained back a couple of pounds.  I wanted to share my experience to see if anyone else noticed the same. I went to Medi Weight Loss Clinic where I was given this medicine for only a few weeks because I wasn&#039;t that overweight.  What I noticed was the increase of energy, that I had lost after menopause, I also lost all hot flashes, night sweats, and irritability.  After not taking the medicine for a couple of weeks all menopause symptoms came back. My friend had the same happen to her.  I think it would be a great for menopause.""",2
Orsythia,Birth Control,"""I have been on Orsythia for a year now and I have to say that I have never been happier with another birth control and I&#039;ve one other before starting Orsythia. I did NOT gain any weight, lose my sex drive, get acne, have mood swings, PMS symptoms or most importantly get pregnant on this birth control. I am so happy with my rx and I would highly recommend. I understand that everyone is different and experience drugs differently but you need to wait the 3-4 months before getting used to a daily drug in your body that changes your natural hormones. I love it and I see that it is very effective for me.""",8
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I have been on gabapentin going on almost a year, I have had anxiety all my life, but even more after I became a heroin, and cocaine user. I started taking Neurontin in prison, and these pills have helped me so much, and now I take 1200 in the morning, and 1200 in the evening, and I&#039;m the happiest girl on earth and I&#039;ve been clean, they help for real, I&#039;m happy to clean, and cook, and spend time with my son. It&#039;s non narcotic, and a blessing.""",7
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I have had insomnia and chronic pain for 24 years. I&#039;ve seen every specialist imaginable and no one could seem to help me. But I was still taking sleep aids every night, sometimes doubling up on the dosage. At my worst I was taking a handful of pills just to fall asleep and my family worried that someday I would not wake up. I went to a lung specialist and he prescribed Elavil. I have been on it for about 4 months now at 100 mg and I RARELY need to take a sleep aid. I just get sleepy and go to bed, like &quot;normal people&quot;. =) I also noticed a great reduction in my pain levels. So it&#039;s either the Elavil that is helping the pain directly or its the restful sleep. Either way I am thrilled w the medication!""",0
Vicodin,Pain,"""I had 2 foot surgeries within 9 months of each other that took me over 2 years to heal, and was given Vicodin for the pain. At first it was awesome, it took care of the pain but I slept all the time. After a while I ended up taking more to relieve the pain, which scared me. So I would go off of it for a month or so and live in agony to prove I was not addicted.  It detaches you from whats going on around you. I finally figured out that I would rather be in some pain than be so depressed as that drug made me feel. I just stick to ibuprofen now.""",9
Vilazodone,Depression,"""Titrated up to 40mg over two weeks and then tried riding it out for another couple of weeks. Eventually I could not take another day and discontinued the medication. Not only did I not experience relief, but I feel my symptoms worsened while taking Viibryd. I was more irritable, restless, angry, upset, and anxious than I had ever been in my entire life. Also experienced a lot of nausea and headaches""",5

Implanon,Birth Control,"""Worst birth control ever. I would NOT recommend this birth control to anyone. I experienced non stop bleeding to the point where it was effecting my sex life with my boyfriend. I was always depressed, horrible mood swings, I got severe nausea and got sick to my stomach on it.

After an X-ray, two MRI&#039;s finally found out I have a full tear of the gluteus minimus in left hip and partial in right. I will continue taking til surgery and probably after as well, as I can only have one side repaired at a time.  Has seemed to work wonders for me!""",9
Lexapro,Depression,"""This medication is NOT for teenagers.
My son was so depressed we could not get him out of his room for days on end.  We eventually got convinced him that he needed help and agreed to start taking medications and spending more time out in the sun and exercise.

Week 6 my son started punching holes in walls and throwing things when he has never done anything like this before.  Week 8 my son killed a little girl.  A friend of the family.

I took 25 mg at night the first 30 days and I&#039;m now on the start of the third month at 50 mg at night, also, 37.5 mg Adipex every morning. With Topamax I CANNOT eat. Everything I eat makes me sick. It definitely changes you&#039;re sense of taste and smell which has pretty much stopped my smoking. So, there are huge benefits just the side effects can be a little unbearable at times. I&#039;ve lost 28.7 pounds in 2 months""",2
Minocycline,Acne,"""43 year old with embarrassing blind pimples often turning to revolting whiteheads around chin area. First 2 weeks no clear improvement probably a little worse. Existing pimples seemed to flare up with whiteheads. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s all the bacteria finding a way out? Its been 2 weeks &amp; finally seeing clearer skin. No whiteheads or blind pimples just purple spots that will hopefully heal.   No side effects at this point. Taking one morning &amp; night.""",4
Doxycycline,Acne,"""My dermatologist put me on Doryx a couple months back. My acne was bad, inflamed and painful all over my cheeks. I took half the pill once a day and at first it made my skin dry out. But my acne disappeared within a week and a half. Afterwards I stopped using it. Then noticed my skin breaking out again. So I&#039;m back on it again and it has settled my skin. I quit eating dairy as well while taking it and I have yet to have a breakout. I now take it every other day as it dries out the skin all over my body. But totally worth the results !!""",4
Xanax,Anxiety,"""Xanax has been a life saver. I have always had problems feeling a little anxious.  But once I was diagnosed as having a brain tumor at 26, it only made things worse.  My doctor prescribed Lexapro, which worked okay, but I didn&#039;t like the way it made me feel, so I stopped taking them on my own.  One particular night about 3 weeks ago, I got so upset that I thought I was having a heart attack.  I was dizzy, chest hurting and pounding, weakness. Nobody could find anything medically wrong with me.  I asked the doctor for something for anxiety to which he prescribed Xanax 0.25mg every 6 hours and within the 30 minutes of taking it, all my symptoms had diminished.  Xanax really saved my life.""",7
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on Lamictal for 7 years for severe depression - love it. I do better, it helps control the suicidality and anger and helped me keep a job when I am well enough to work. Word of caution: DO NOT TAKE ESTROGEN CONTAINING BIRTH CONTROL WITH THIS MEDICINE. It lowers the amount of Lamictal in your blood by half, so you go through withdrawals, then on the fourth week of the month you are toxic. So take the medicine if it helps, but beware of mixing it with birth control pills.""",6
Intuniv,ADHD,"""Our son was diagnosed with ADD when he was in grade 5-he was started on vyvanse and after a few months and a dose increase developed psychotic episodes.  This experience scared the life out of me so we stopped the drug and revisited pharmaceuticals with our pediatrician.
She suggested Intuniv and we tried it. 
Our son has been on the drug now for almost 4 years-he is on the max dose for his age (3 mg) (?) and I honestly can&#039;t see if there is a difference.  He has had no visible side effects-nothing like I have been reading about above. If anything he has put on weight (it is not a stimulant).
We are going to try weaning him off in the next few months to see if there is a difference in schoolwork and to see if the med is really working.""",1
Bupropion,Depression,"""I use Wellbutrin XL 300mg.  I am using it now for over 2 years early in the mornings. I also use Molipaxin 200mg in the evening.  I was very sick. I had ECT for a couple of times.  My Doctor prescribed Molipaxin after a long struggle with too much side effects of other anti-depressants.  I used a lot of other anti-depressants over the years.  I am using Molipaxin now for almost 4 years with almost no side-affects. I struggled with tiredness all the time and was described Wellbutrin in combination with Molipaxin. I can&#039;t tell you how it changed my life. It felt like I was alive and vibrant again. I had 2 bad panic attacks over the last two years. Before it used to happen almost everyday. I stopped all the Urbanol and Sleeping tablets.""",5
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""when I was first put on this medication in the emergency room, I was coming off heroin and my mood swings was horrific, and my anxiety was off the charts, they put me on 200 mg. immediately and was to take it 3 times a day. I was diagnosed as bipolar, ptsd severe anxiety disorder, hearing voices to kill myself, sleep disorder, among a few others. I have loved this medicine since day one almost 4 years ago. I have ended up 150 lbs. over weight, and diabetic. however one may see this, I call this my miracle pill. I wish I had been put on it as a teenager. I have told my psych don&#039;t ever try to take this away from me, I get paranoid at thinking about it. I may be fat and diabetic, but I have a good life and great family.""",6
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I had been suffering with chronic pain for years.  Finally, a friend pointed out to me how depressed I was most of the time.  I suppose I have been suffering from some sort of depression most of my life, but just accepted the feelings as normal or just my personality in general.  Finally I found a pain specialist who put me on a very effective combination of meds, including Cymbalta.  Along with morphine and percocet it has worked wonders for me.  I seem to be as good now as I could ever imagine.  Bouts of depression are very mild and far between each other.  My pain is still there but mild enough to not effect my outlook on life.  The only warning I have about taking Cymbalta is to make sure you don&#039;t run out.  Missing few days is a horror""",5
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Pristiq now for about 4 months. I could tell the difference in my moods almost right away. Every little thing used to make me cry, but not any longer. The only side effect I experienced was dry mouth. Really wish I  could have felt a decrease in appetite. The withdrawals are pretty bad for me though. One day I forgot to take it and almost pulled my hair out. I was crying uncontrollably over nothing which I didn&#039;t even do before taking the medicines. I was also having major brain zaps. I recommend coming off slowly. All in all though, I love it.""",5
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been on Cymbalta for about 8 months now. I never had major side effects to begin with but the last 3 months I&#039;ve been experiencing nightmares or crazy dreams, I&#039;m tired a lot, I sweat at night, I feel as if I&#039;m in one mood and the only major emotion I get is anger. It&#039;s hard to laugh at things that I used to and I can&#039;t cry anymore. Sometimes I just want to feel frustrated when I know I should, and sad, but I feel stuck and emotionless. I don&#039;t think Cymbalta has helped me. I think the only progress I&#039;ve made with my anxiety, OCD, and depression has been on my own.""",7
Tenuate,Obesity,"""I have been taking the 75mg for 2 months now. I have lost 43lbs so far. I can&#039;t believe how much it helps with my hunger. Before I would be hungry all day, and I would eat all day. Now I stick with a 1000 calorie diet, and I make sure I eat breakfast, and all my meals are much smaller portions. There are even days I skip a dose, and I wouldn&#039;t even know it. I would recommend it for anyone who has fought with their weight over the years. After only 2 months I have been able to stop taking my blood pressure medicine.""",2
Halcion,Insomnia,"""I was on halcion for almost 5 years until I built a tolerance and it stopped working.  Since then I have tried numerous medications of various types and none have worked as well as halcion.  Most have not even been close or didn&#039;t work at all.  With halcion, I fell asleep quickly and naturally, and stayed asleep at least 6 hours.  It was a restful sleep with no side effects like dreams or strange behavior.  I had no problems waking up or functioning the following day.  It&#039;s only now that I can&#039;t find a substitute that I really appreciate the benefits of halcion.""",0
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I started this medication over 2 weeks ago and I have lost 12lbs. The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced are occasional headaches here and there, but Advil cleared that up. Changed my diet and definitely not having cravings any more,  so much that my boyfriend bought me a donut and I told him no thanks!  Super proud of myself.  Can&#039;t wait to see my results after a couple of months,  have to lose 40 lbs in total.""",3
Taytulla,Birth Control,"""I just got off depo and wanted implanon but they told me to take a &quot;three month break&quot; since I been on it so long. Anyways I have been taking taytulla for about three weeks. My breast are killing me. They feel like thy weight 100 pounds and are lumpy. Will update more once the shot leaves my body more and have been taking the pill longer. That&#039;s the only side effect that I am seeing so far.""",8
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I have been on 50 mgs of Trazodone for about two weeks - I would take about 9:00 pm but was two or so hours before I feel asleep. Tried taking earlier still was midnight-Plus find myself tried and sleepy during the day to where I need a short nap.  So tonight I took at 8:00 and its 2:00 am haven&#039;t felt sleepy yet. I decided I would take another 50 mgs to see if it works.  Will try 100 mgs next time if that doesn&#039;t work calling my doctor""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hello I&#039;m 20 year and I&#039;m 5&#039;3.5. I&#039;ve just started taking Phentermine 37.5 mgs, on December 1,2016. My intital weigh I started out with was 255lbs. I have no clue of my weight now. But this pill I take gives me dry mouth and a slight fast heart beat. Since I was 15 I always been a big gal, and then when I was 16 I was dianosed with high blood pressure and slight heart trouble. We&#039;ll finally when I was 19 I was in Florida for a job at Daytona500 Club. And a week later after my job interview in Florida I woke up one morning feeling really sick. I&#039;ve went in the hospital for about five days.Then I said to myself I&#039;m to young to die so I started dieting no luck there on my own. So I went to my doctor for help so wish me luck.

Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started these pills on 09/26/16 my starting weight was 226 pounds so its been I guess almost 2 weeks stepped on the scale 10/05/16 and I am down to about 210 pounds which is good because I did not feel like I lost anything....When I first started I was very jittery, headache, and not eating a lot of stuff my goal is to get up under 200 pounds and come off of the pill within the next month I am hoping. I have started to experience a little of chest pain I am 27 years old and 5&#039;5 so at my age i really want to lose inches so I am going to start adding exercise in my diet maybe a routine. I hope this helps.""",3
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""I have found Seroquel to be an excellent option for individuals like myself who may have formed an addiction to the regularly prescribed sleep medicines.  I have suffered with insomnia for over 30 years. On this medicine, I have experienced sleep without morning grogginess; however there have been severe muscle jerks of my legs - more severe than my regular restless leg syndrome which I have already been diagnosed.  This side effect is why the medication is not rated at a higher level.  But I would rather have the muscle jerks of my legs than to go through the drug detox process again.""",0
Ambien,Insomnia,"""For the first time I can get to sleep every night.  It usually gives me about 5 hours of sleep, and if I wake up and take about 0.15 Klonopin, I can go back to sleep for another 3 hours.  Feel rested for the first time in years!  I don&#039;t take it until I am absolutely ready to lay down in bed, then lay down and think happy thoughts to carry with me to dream land.  Previously, due to bipolar insomnia,  I would take tons of Nyquil, Benadryl, Sominex, l-tyrosine, melatonin that only gave me a few hours sleep and I&#039;d wake up and take more pills. For years I couldn&#039;t sleep in a bed but would wander through the house at night trying to get comfortable on the floor, etc. as my husband just bumping me would wake me up.  I thank you Ambien!""",0
Belviq,Obesity,"""I gave the medication some points because once I started taking it I immediately experienced a decrease in appetite.  I took 10 mg In the morning and 10 mg At night.  The first side effect was dry mouth and the second was a crushing headache.  I read this site and decided to work through it.  On day 3 I developed a huge rash on my inner thigh and then on my shoulders.  I had strange nightmares and felt out of sorts.  I then had irritability and snapped at my husband and young son on several occasions after day 5. On day six I stood up and felt dizzy and weird.  I developed anxiety and felt upset. By day 8 my husband and I talked and looked up the contents of the medicine.  Serotonin stood out to me.  I stopped taking it.  Run.""",2
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I had an accident at work 5 years ago. This has caused mid-lower back pain and sciatica on and off for several years. Over time the injury has got worse. The pain is now also radiating into my groin area. I take co-codomal 60/1000mg 4 times a day, 500mg naproxen twice daily and now on 30mg of amitriptyline at night after the other medications weren&#039;t working.

The pain hasn&#039;t gone but it is bearable. On bad days I was unable to walk. Since starting the amitriptyline, I have had a couple of side effects. Dry mouth and tiredness in the day (however this has got better over time). My quality of life has significantly improved and I can live with the side affects.""",9
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Once it is in your system, the side effects are not so strong.  For me it went from severe dizziness and basically &quot;knocking me out&quot;..to no side effects.  I also woke up severally drowsy and thought why take this if I can&#039;t function the next day?  But, I got to a point where I was not sleeping at all, so I kept trying this drug and it got better.  I was able to get some sleep and not have harsh side effects.  I want to take this short term to get back on track on my own.  I am scheduled to see a sleep dr..but until then I will have to take this.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking phentermine on February 14, 2014, Since then I have lost at least fifteen pounds and it has not even been a whole month yet, this is awesome, I work night shift so it keeps me up all night and gives me plenty of energy, I hardly ever get a chance to work out because I have three children that crave a lot of attention, this stuff is the best thing since sliced bread! I don&#039;t think about eating, I will force myself to eat a little bit of something healthy every few hours, the side effects were scarey the first two days but after that my body pretty much got used to them. Anyone looking to lose weight this is most definitely a jump start way!""",3
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started at 25 mg of Lamictal. After 2 weeks my doctor increased it to 50 mg. 2 weeks after increasing my med I noticed a minor skin rash on my chest one night. I overlooked it &amp; continued taking the Lamictal. When my doctor increased it to 100 mg that is when I started having a bad reaction. That night I broke out in a bad rash on my chest, stomach &amp; left arm (not my right arm). I also started having bad chest pains. I called my doctors office the next day &amp; the nurse told me to stop taking the Lamictal &amp; go to the hospital. I&#039;m stubborn, so I refused to go. My chest pains had gone away &amp; the rash was clearing up, so I wasn&#039;t as worried about it as I was the night before. I decided to go to the EmergiCare instead &amp; I turned out to be OK""",6
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have struggled with severe anxiety and major depression for 30 years. I have been on MANY different anxiety meds and anti depressants. The only 2 meds that helped slightly were  Paxil and Ativan for panic/anxiety. I was diagnosed with Bipolar about 5 years ago and once again tried other meds. I heard about Lamictal helping other people, so my doctor said we could try it. It has been a LIFESAVER!! I still take Paxil and Ativan, but after the first few days of taking Lamictal, it helped tremendously with my mood swings. But most important, it improved my anxiety by at least 75% if not more. It has been a Godsend for me. I take 100mg a day. Thanks.""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I took 37.5 at 7:00am 
First five minutes I felt a warm sensation all over; about 20 minutes later I felt as if my body was drunk and heavy. Then a burst of energy came I could not stop moving for the next 4 hours. I detailed cleaed my whole house. I could not eat  (eat before the pill) food was a turn off for me. I felt full and satisfied with 2 cracker&#039;s. I only gave it a 7 because I was very nauseous. I vomited without warning on my floor. Stayed pretty sick to my stomach all day. I lost 2 lbs the first day.""",3
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I began taking pain meds on a 12 hr basis with prn oxycodone for breakthrough pain in 1996. We started with oxycontin ER, which has actually been the most effective, although very shortly we discovered I am a rapid metabolizer and it had to be increased to every 8 hrs. Then that doc retired. The new one refused to give it to her pts, so I went thru a different pain med about every 3yrs....until I hit the jackpot w Opana! It took minor juggling the 1st 3 months, but for 5yrs I have taken it or the generic &amp; had no side effects &amp; haven&#039;t needed a dose increase!
As a retired RN, PhD, I will suggest you ask your doc  do genetic screening focusing on one&#039;s body&#039;s ability to take specific drugs successfully. """,9
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I have struggled with severe acne on my face, chest, and back since I was 14 and I am now 22. I had cystic acne that was so painful and embarrassing that I would often cancel plans so I wouldn&#039;t have to go in public. I have seen multiple doctors and dermatologists and nothing has worked for me. I have tried everything but accutane because I&#039;m too scared about the side effects. I wanted to try spiro because my sister who had acne worse than me is taking spiro and it completely cleared her acne. I started at 50mg per day in April and it did cause an initial flare up but after the flare up subsided I didn&#039;t get anymore cystic acne. I still got smaller spots of acne but no more painful cysts. Now I am at 75mg per day and I hardly ever get acne!""",4
Bupropion,Obesity,"""I used Wellbutrin XL for two years, and in conjunction with sensible eating and a walking regimen, lost 75 pounds.  I believe the Wellbutrin gave me the motivation to stick with the eating and exercise plan.  It may have also provided a pharmacological effect. I&#039;ve since stopped using Wellbutrin due to it not being specifically recognized as a weight loss product, but rather as an antidepressant.  Choosing this product in assisting my weight loss categorized me as being depressed, and adversely affected my ability to obtain favorable life insurance premium rates. After using Wellbutrin, I was given Bupropion XL due to managed care requirements to switch to generic prescription.  I stopped taking Bupropion because it proved ineffective for me.""",2
Sertraline,Depression,"""My doctor prescribed this for depression issues/severe anxiety associated with adult ADD. I was very resistant to try, have been put on multiple other meds that made things much worse. I take 50mg daily. Immediately felt almost &quot;euphoric.&quot; With each passing day, I feel better in every sense, and the anxiety is gone. I NEVER write any posts EVER, but this has been an unbelievable game changer. I have been battling these issues since childhood, and I can truly say I feel happy and hopeful about my future. The &quot;internal storm&quot; inside that I battled every day to cope with is gone. No side effects except for some vivid, strange dreams-but those are dissipating. I hope this helps someone-if this one doesn&#039;t help, keep trying and never give up.""",5
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I have taken half a tablet of doxylamine succinate (Sleep Aid), in the evening, for about 3 years now. I originally took it for migraines, but discovered quickly, how it made me very drowsy after about 2 hours.
It has NEVER failed to work. Taking a whole tablet made me sleep for 10-12 hours, now I get my 8 hours every night with half the dose. It is one of the safest antihistamines on the market.
I experimented a few months ago, by not taking one, &amp; I couldn&#039;t get to sleep, plus I got restless legs. So now I take it every night.""",0
Citalopram,Depression,"""I have been taking citalopram 60mg for about 3 years.
At first it was working great, I was smiling more and laughing from the bottom of my stomach instead of just my throat. Now though I feel like it has completely stopped working. I have mood swings, anxiety, fears, not sleeping, waking up before dawn, etc. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me or is my medicine telling me it need&#039;s a change. What else can I try? I need my life back, my children need me.""",5
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This medication literally saved my life. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 1. I also experience mixed episodes and psychosis.  I&#039;ve tried countless antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics. Upon being recommended this anticonvulsant, I was skeptical. It took a while to titrate to the effective level. I am now on 300 mg of Lamictal every day. This medication gave me head aches at first, I also experienced weight loss. I still have my bad days but they&#039;re not as intense and frequent as they were before this medication. I now have the will to live again, thanks to lamictal.""",6
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I have taken this medication during certain times in my life due to events and change of time zones for long periods of time when my sleep pattern is broken.  It is great.  I have been able to stay at 25 mg without increase for more than a year and work myself off when fully recovered.  Be prepared to wait for it to kick in up to 2 weeks after starting it.  It needs to fully get into your system.  Everyones body is different.  Recently I tried zolpidem for a more immediate sleep and found I could only get 4 hours a night. I read about the addiction of it and possible rebound insomnia after weaning yourself off.  I am going back to that old model medicine, Amitriiptyline.  It is great and I get back to a 7-8 hour sleep pattern.""",0
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I had a negative reaction to Dilaudid after a surgical procedure.  It made me itch horribly and my mouth broke out on the inside.  I had to stop taking it after two days when the palms of my hands and bottom of my feet were itching like crazy.  I was then prescribed Ultram which made me so nauseous I had to go to bed.  I finally just quit the pain medicines after four days and coasted along with ibuprofen until I was over the surgery completely.""",9
Phentermine,Obesity,"""At age 54,  taking this is the only way I&#039;ve been able to lose weight. I used to be able to lose 10 to 20 pounds pretty easily with just better food choices and mild exercise. But over the last  several years with a strict Paleo diet and exercising five days a week, three days a week with a trainer, I Wasn&#039;t able to drop a single pound.  As you get older you must consume a depressingly small amount of food in order to lose weight, this drug gives you the willpower to stay with a low cal a day diet.  For me it&#039;s impossible to shop and cook and only consume my low cal per day. So, I used prepared food services like  eat fit go and factor 75 to be certain of the calories I&#039;m consuming with no leftovers and no snacking during cooking.""",2
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""Horrible! Was put on this due to high blood pressure. I have taken it at the exact  same time every day for 9 months, never missing one. Bleeding very irregular, sometimes every other week and more constant than not. Sometimes heavy, sometimes light. Flip of a coin I guess. Dr said to give it a few months to settle down, it did for a little bit then right back to more than not. Guess that&#039;s how it works for birth control.... Last  thing I actually feel like doing! No weight gain or any other side effects. Going to change it at next dr. Appointment. Had enough.""",8
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I have been having depression for about 10 years. It took a long time to get the right one. Eventually I was put on Effexor XR. Started from 37.5 then finally 300mg per day. Effexor gave me a lot of side effects but I found it to be very good making me feel myself again. There was only one major problem, I got addicted to GAMBLING even from the day I started with 37.5. I was in major dept. I am now trying other medicines (Seroquel) but I am not the same anymore, very lazy, no motivation. Since I have stopped Effexor I have stopped gambling. And as for the depression, I am on trial with Seroquel. Wish me luck!!""",5
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I was on clonazepam about 3/4 years ago for about 6-1 year.... Best moments in my life I was very socially active had many friends, went to school graduated from school. I was able to sleep very well. The reason I had to get on the medications in the first place is because my anxiety was acting up, I couldn&#039;t sleep, I would behave very wildly at times. I took 3 mg a day . 1 mg in the morning and 2 mg at night. I became a Christian and I tapered of the meds, I believe meds should be taken short term less than 6 months . I wanna get back on klonopin 2mgs at night 3 if they say so but just 2 is fine with me. I&#039;ve been through much trauma I&#039;m currently on gabapentin and it&#039;s not helpin as klonopin gabap is similar to klonopin.""",7
Elavil,Insomnia,"""I have a very high tolerance for a lot of pain medications due to pain issues. Your body always needs more and more to produce the same effect until almost nothing works. 

Fortunately, this type of medication doesn&#039;t affect me that way. Although I guess it is mainly used for depression. It has worked like a charm for me to get my body to sleep much longer. And I have never had to increase the dose. The only drawback for me with this medication is that when I do wake up I am pretty groggy for about 45 minutes.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""When I 1st heard of this pill I went straight to Google to see peoples experience ....which everyone was saying how much weight they lost so I had to try for myself ! I&#039;m 5&#039;2 n weighed 160 ! The 1st day I took it I was shocked on how high it made me feel. I had no trouble sleeping no bad side affects . After 6 days on pill I went from a size 10 to 8. I dropped 9 pounds. I just weighed myself and I&#039;m down to 146 and it hasn&#039;t even been 2 weeks. Yes this pill works but if u want to loose weight don&#039;t skip pills. Trust me its worth it. Good luck to y&#039;all !!""",3
Strattera,ADHD,"""I have been taking Straterra for around six days now. I&#039;m starting to notice a bit of a difference, a positive difference. 

I feel a lot calmer, I don&#039;t feel so emotional. I&#039;m also studying much better. I can read up to twenty to thirty pages of lengthy legal text without losing concentration. 

I have a history of depression, so my psychiatrist put me on Strattera for my ADHD and symptoms of depression. I am going to review my rating of this drug in a month or so, but for now I&#039;m quite happy.

Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Belviq two weeks ago. At first I only took one pill a day, but on week two I moved to two pills a day as prescribed. I&#039;ve lost 8lbs in two weeks by taking the pill as directed, twice a day, and maintaining my calorie intake (1200 or below). I&#039;ve also made sure I&#039;m drinking at least 100oz of water each day and have cut out sodas throughout the week. I have faith that I&#039;ll reach my Weightloss goal.""",3
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am a 54 year old woman who started Contrave as a last ditch effort to loose weight before choosing surgery. I found loosing weight while experiencing menopause impossible. When I started the medication, I weighed 213. and I am 5&#039; 2&quot;. I have lost 60 pounds in 16 months. I have had very few side effects. The medication gave me the tool I needed to change my eating lifestyle.  My high blood pressure is resolved and my blood sugars are now normal. I highly recommend this medication. If you are looking for a fast solution, this is not for you. Although I do not discourage exercise, I would like to mention that I am not in any kind of exercise program. I&#039;ve gone from a size 18, to a size 10. I am grateful to my Dr. For prescribing this med.""",2
Concerta,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD a little less than a year ago at the age of 12. At first, I loved it because it helped me get so much work done and I stopped getting in trouble and annoying people. After about one month I started realizing that I wasn&#039;t eating because the medicine was destroying my appetite, and I liked it. I started using the drug more for weight loss than anything and I went from a happy, bubbly 115 lbs to a lifeless 95 lbs. at 5ft8in, that&#039;s severely underweight and unhealthy. I kept taking the medicine but I became increasingly more depressed and anxious. I was an outcast but I was too obsessed with losing weight to care. After the school year finished, I took a break from the medicine and I am now a happy, healthy 13yr old.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""This medication works YES...HOWEVER it has side effects not listed &amp; if you don&#039;t workout then you&#039;re not going to see the same results as the people loosing the mass amounts of weight!!! I took this supplement/medication almost 6 years ago &amp; I worked my hind end off the 30 days I took it I lost 17 pounds that&#039;s all I need motivation to get me started in the right direction to a healthy life I worked out five days a wk changed all my eating habits (stopped eating when I was satisfied not full, if I craved it I bought it took a bite/drink and satisfied my craving) I was the smallest and healthiest I had ever been or so I thought till 2/25/15 when I had my gallbladder removed bc the damage me &amp; my dr believes to have been from the adipex!""",3
Buprenorphine,Pain,"""I have taken Norco on and off for my neck and back pain for years.  My stomach produces too much stomach acid and so I developed stomach problems and can no longer take those type of prescriptions orally. I couldn&#039;t take enough Norco all of the time to keep the pain under control without it making me sick anyway.  Butrans came along and now the pain is consistently under control and no stomach problems.""",9
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""Started this medication in November of 2016. So far I have lost almost 30lbs. It works. It completely takes your mind of food. You still want to eat but not the constant obsessive thinking about eating and what you&#039;re going to eat next . I like to think this is what normal weight people must eat like. The weight has just slowly and steadily come off for me with minimal effort on my part other than reducing what I&#039;m consuming.
My side effects have been minimal: slight tingling in fingers and toes occasionally, loss of concentration periodically, dry mouth sometimes but all of these things have been minor inconveniences and worth the weight loss and how I feel, overall given the pros and (serious) cons of this drug I would recommend.""",3
Effexor,Depression,"""I took Effexor XR 150mg for a good 10 years for depression.  Then, I switched to Zoloft due to what is considered a side-effect of Effexor:  elevated liver enzymes.  On Zoloft, I felt more anxious than I did on Effexor, but not overly so.  It was tolerable.   I continued to have same liver enzymes while on Zoloft.   It turns out the enzyme issue is not related to the medication alone, if at all.  I had a stressful life changing event and felt very anxious.  I know I felt much less anxious on Effexor so I asked to be switched back and I was.  The doctor made a general statement that he wants me on what works best for me.  However, I&#039;m pretty sure he didn&#039;t buy my anxiety theory. """,5
Nucynta,Pain,"""After spending years on very high doses of tramadol, Nucynta has worked better than any amount of tramadol or any of the other narcotic pain killers I have used. This medicine is closely related to tramadol (depending on who you ask but most say yes it is). They tweeked tramadols formula to make it much stronger so its just a narcotic. I am able to take Nucynta for breakthrough pain once or twice a day. My baseline pain reliever is Ultram ER 300mg. I take Cymbalta as well as the other two, so the doctor and pharmacy dude like to whine about serotonin syndrome. Nucynta is like tramadol in its anti-depressant makeup. I have no side effects probably because I&#039;m used to tramadol. """,9
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Nexplanon for 2 years today, so I have another year to go. I love it, but I thought it&#039;d be different than the others. I&#039;ve been on a journey to find the best birth control for me, and I think I&#039;ve tried everything. I started off on the pills, but couldn&#039;t remember to take it, then the patch that fell off constantly, then the nuvaring that fell out, then the depo shot. This is where I slowly but surely gained weight. 2012 November weight at 110, and in 2013 134lbs. I changed the method to Nexplanon, and this is where I started to notice the no periods, and less hassle. But dramatically my weight increased. I&#039;m currently 155lbs, I exercise and eat right. I can&#039;t lose anything. My emotions are through the roof all the time.""",8
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADD at the end of grade 6 and started taking concerta in grade 7. I had no idea I had ADD and just though everyone was like me. I had no enthusiasm anything with school but after I took concerta I was like ADHD. So much hyperness and wanting to work. After raising the dose to 36mg I started to get very anxious about my heart feeling like it was beating too fast and was having like a panic attack or something so then I dropped back down to 27mg. The side affects I have is weight loss/loss of appitite, heart palpitations, sleep paraylisis, feelings of excitement. It works for me but I hate the side affects. I also lost 5lbs in one week when I first started and 20lbs in 2 years.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Adipex since the beginning of December and my starting weight was 271 and as of Thursday I weighed in at 246. I am very pleased with my weight loss and very disappointed in myself to have reached a whopping 270. I guess it&#039;s better late than never. I do experience some side effects which includes dry mouth and constipated at times. When this happens I drink even more water and drink a swig of vinegar..it usually helps. I have not incorporated exercise in my plan yet but plan to start next week.   I wanted to get the diet down pact first..I do recommend this pill for anyone that has a lot of weight to lose!""",3
Dapsone,Acne,"""I started suffering from moderate cystic acne in my mid-30s and Aczone is the only medication that has helped (aside from oral antibiotics, which I didn&#039;t want to take long term).  I noticed a difference almost immediately.  I&#039;m now 3 weeks into my treatment plan and my skin is perfectly clear.  I use Aczone in the morning, Glycolix 5-2 pads late in the afternoon, and Tretinoin 0.05% at night.  I moisturize dry spots with Skinceuticals Phyto corrective serum. My skin hasn&#039;t looked this good in years!""",4
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I can say without reservation that this works. Start weight 246 lbs 5&quot;9 and end weight 202lbs so far in five months. It takes time and I work out as best I can but my goal will be accomplished in one year.
I find my appetite is easily managed as far as sweets, salty snacks etc. My appetite is fine as things taste good but no binges. Had a headache and now drink probably what I should have been doing all along. I consider this Belviq a nice aid to helping me with weight loss success. """,2
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""It&#039;s too bad that the internet seems to have only the negative reviews- very few positives- whether it be of a restaurant or a medication.  When things are really good people aren&#039;t apt to post about it.  

I have been on Abilify for two different rounds.  I take 400 mg each of Wellbutrin and Lamictal and my dr. suggested I add Abilify to augment due to some depression I was having.  It seemed to work in the beginning but then I had some weight gain and attributed it to that- so I went off of it for a few months.  My weight went up anyway due to poor eating habits.  I ended up in another depression a few months later and I decided to give Abilify 10 mg another try.  I am feeling much better!""",6
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I just got my skyla in yesterday so this rating is only for the insertion process itself. I have been on the pill for the past year and a half but I wasn&#039;t very good at taking it on time and correctly so my doctor and I decided to try an IUD. As I&#039;m 18 and have never had kids the skyla it was. I&#039;m not going to lie I tend to overestimate how much something is going to hurt and end up being fine but unfortunately that wasn&#039;t the case for this. The pain was definitely there and actually hurt more than I thought it would. I couldn&#039;t stand up for about ten minutes after the insertion and driving home was a a nightmare. I had to pull over because my vision was blurry. Be cautious with this. Hoping the good outweighs the bad.""",8
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""Have suffered with insomnia for years. Tried many medications with Zolpidem  ER (Generic Ambien ER) 12.5 the only one that helped. Even then, still was not getting great results at times.  Tried 10 mg of Belsomra, hoping for a better result. This was one of the worst nights I have ever had in my life.  Was wide awake until 4:30, followed by horrible, segmented, almost hallucinogenic dreams. After my alarm woke me, I was in the strangest state of mind, where I had to make myself speak. I finally told my husband, I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;ve got plenty of conversation in my head, but I have to MAKE myself speak.  I was afraid to drive after this, and had my son drive me. This condition eventually got better. One dose. Never again.""",0
Fentanyl,Pain,"""My Pain is completely alleviated with this medication when in normal use.  I am on a 3 day schedule in changing the patches.  I did try to go on a 2 day schedule as well, but then I experience too many unwanted side effects (drowsiness, feeling &#039;high&#039;, etc) so I asked to go back to 3 days.  After about 2 and 1/4 days the patch doesn&#039;t seem to work, so the final 3/4 day I really start to feel the pain and withdrawal symptoms.  

I sometimes feel the loss of &#039;control&#039; with the patch because of the time it takes for it to become effective and the amount of time it goes out of your system.  In other words, if a patch rips (I&#039;ve had 2 do so in the last year) I start to feel the medicine pouring into my system and I have to immediately take off the patch.""",9
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""40 y/o WF I&#039;m in day 3 of Contrave and have lost 2 lbs. can&#039;t be water weight because I&#039;m drinking tons of water due to the dry mouth it gives me. No nausea or headache. i will say that I haven&#039;t been sleeping well however during the day, I feel almost &quot;speedy.&quot; Not twitching or anxious but more energetic and focused whereas normally I could take a nap nearly anytime! I am very nervous about this medication though because in 2007 I had a seizure. I&#039;m not epileptic and they never found the cause but I keep reading how it lowers the seizure threshold. My doctor obviously thinks the risk is minuscule but I&#039;m still leary... Will update:) cheers""",3
Diclofenac,Pain,"""I must say, having tried Lidoderm gel, lidocaine patches, and many others. I have to be honest, these patches are amazing, I got a real mad torn meniscus &amp; was in unbearable pain. Pain meds didn&#039;t even help, but this patch was amazing in it&#039;s effectiveness. I got a sample from my pain management Dr., &amp; just decided to use it thinking it can&#039;t hurt, so glad I did, MIRACLES. Note: the pain med was only Lortab but it most definitely aided in the dealing with of the pain. 
The only draw back, which was a big one, but pain is under control but you cannot mix other NSAID w/ this like Advil, aspirin, etc.. 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   
I&#039;m scared to find out their cost, I have a script for them but if the lidocaine was exactly 10$ each patch, likely more $""",9
Benzaclin,Acne,"""Within 3 days acne pustules and swollen skin had reduced and not painful in my entire chin/jaw area.
Its a bit drying and skin feels &#039;tight&#039; but that&#039;s easy to handle with applying extra moisturizer.
  I&#039;ve been an esthetician for 20 years so when adult acne showed up I tried everything spa treatment wise but after 2 years of the pain, discolouration, constant break outs this is what my GP prescribed - I&#039;m so thankful!""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been on Adipex for about 2 months. Started out at 262 pounds. At my 1 month check up I weighed 249 so I lost 13 pounds in the first month. It&#039;s a few days before my second check up and I weigh 239 pounds so I only lost 10 pounds this month. I feel stuck at my new weight.. So I need to change something about my exercise or my eating. I really feel like this medicine is great for anyone with a weight problem. Looking in the mirror I see a whole new person. I set my goal to high and I think that&#039;s what&#039;s causing me to feel like it isn&#039;t good enough. I had a friend who lost 80 pounds in 3 months on Adipex. So I guess it&#039;s about determination. So I&#039;m back to the gym. I want to get down to 150 pounds. Where I haven&#039;t been in 7 years!""",3
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I have been using Belviq for about two years.  I went from 190 down to 165, and then it just stopped helping me lose.  The price is so very high and even though I use a coupon and go to Walmart, each month was a hassle with the pharmacist as to what discount, if any, I would be able to get.  I never heard of $25.00 per month with a voucher!!  I need to know where to get a voucher like THAT!  The last time I tried to use a company coupon, Walmart told me that it was no longer valid.  I&#039;ve never gone back, even thou I have a prescription.  While I was on it, I noticed that my weight was no longer dropping, even tho I was eating the same.  Without a coupon, I won&#039;t be buying it any more....but where can I get a voucher and pay $25.00??""",2
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I wrote a former review on this medication a while back. I want to re-edit my review with a new one thats founded upon newer trials. 

I took the medication, how my doctor told me to (* not how it was perscribed on the bottle *). He said, take this 1x daily (* 30mg *) when you have work or school. Well, having ADHD-PI I need to take this DAILY - meaning everyday. Without it, I&#039;m a mess. I can&#039;t focus on social conversations (* I always feel like I&#039;m &quot;lost in translation&quot; *)

With this medication, I am confident I can pursue my studies at college - without experiencing defeat, and hold down a job and friendships. I may not be my wacky spontaneous self when I&#039;m on it but it&#039;s worth it I guess.""",1
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""My insomnia comes from anxiety issues when I try to sleep. I found that Ambien didn&#039;t make me sleepy but it did relax me enough to fall asleep. There are tons of stories floating around about strange behavior and I have my share. I found this only happens when I try to do things between ingestion and onset. Only take it when you are already in bed, relaxing, and attempting to fall alseep, and you shouldn&#039;t have any problems.""",0
Bupropion,Depression,"""I started Wellbutrin 5 days ago. The first night I felt like my heart was racing and pounding but it went away the next day. Then at work for the past 2 days I have been sweating excessivley and getting the feeling that I need to sit. Last night after taking the medication for 5 days I had the feeling that my head weighed a 1000 pounds and I just felt so dizzy, lightheaded, and weak I could barely walk right. I went to lay down to sleep and all of a sudden I couldn&#039;t swallow and was gasping for air. It was so scary. I just couldn&#039;t catch my breath. I could feel my throat closing up. I was rushed to E.R and they found I was having an allergic reaction to it.""",5
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""Great medication, worked like magic for me.  However, the major side effect that makes me stop it is the weight gain aspect.  It makes me eat all the time and have cravings to sugar all day long.  I have been on and off Remeron for the last 5 years and the only reason that I am off it is the weight gain.  I have tried many many medications but nothing worked for me.  Remeron is the only anti-depressant that gives me back my life.""",5

For the past 8 months I do 3 days strength/weights &amp;4 days cardio, spending 6-7 hours per week at the gym or outside activity like hiking. It was puzzling to me as to why I hadn&#039;t lost a single pound. Got bloodwork &amp;results were PERFECT- no diabetes, no high cholesterol, no hypoactive thyroid, no high blood pressure. Doctor prescribed Phentermine &amp; in 1 week I lost 11lbs! It seemed this was a &quot;magic weight loss pill.&quot; Weeks 2, 3, and 4 I 
only lost 1lb each, bringing my total 1 month loss to 14lbs. 2 months to go! """,3
Aripiprazole,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on Abilify for a year and a half. In that time I gained 30lbs. It also made me very forgetful. I felt like there was a fog in my brain that just wouldn&#039;t go away. The med did work but I can&#039;t stand feeling like I&#039;m starving every second of the day. I quit cold turkey six days ago and already lost 4 lbs. I feel great...I have more energy, the fog is lifting and I&#039;m not as hungry! Good luck to you.""",6
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I wanted to take the time to write a review in the hopes to give at least one person the self confidence boost they need to keep going with Retin-A.  I&#039;ve been waiting for the day I get to write my own review.  
I officially started using Retin- A .25 just under 4 months ago today.  My first day was 3 weeks before my birthday.  I remember contacting my Dermo in advance with a million questions and mostly the fear of going through THE PURGE during this busy time filled with celebrations, events, etc.  I thankfully, made the gamble and started!  I decided it was always be... I&#039;ll start next week, next month.  Let&#039;s be real, when is there ever a good time for acne?!  
I can only describe the last 4 months as a roller coaster.  There will be good days. There will be days you hide inside. At some points I thought I was done purging, then it would come back.  IT TAKES TIME.  Painful cysts too, that do not go away.  I would rather have 20 white head pimples all over than 1 deep painful cyst on my face!  It was the most challenging thing I&#039;ve gone through. It will test your patience.  To the point of tears, and why me&#039;s!  At one point I scheduled an emergency Dermo appt to receive Cortizon injections on 3 cysts that were almost the size of dimes!! I couldn&#039;t take it anymore.  This was 2.5 months. He sat me down and said it takes 3-4 months for results to be reached and you will hate your dermo for that time and gave me the push to continue to go forward.
Here&#039;s the good news!  I am at my 4 month mark, and I have never been more happy.  I haven&#039;t had a break out in 1.5 weeks.  I don&#039;t know the last time I&#039;ve been able to say that. I can take on the CALI summer and not feel like I&#039;m hiding.  My biggest advise is be strong!   Tell yourself everyday, it&#039;s only 4 months of the rest of your life.  Get past the 4-5 month mark and it will all be worth it!  The past will be a blur!  Good luck and you can do it!""",4
Prozac,Depression,"""I have been experiencing major depression and suicidal thoughts. It got to the point that all I wanted to do everyday is stay in bed, not eat, check my blood pressure all day to make sure I&#039;m not having a aneurysm or stroke. I take the problems of my patients and relate them to myself so in case I get the symptoms they had before having a medical emergency. I start to panic and lose my appetite, etc. I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. I&#039;ve seen a psychologist, who was helpful but once I left it was hard for me to focus on the things we talked about due to my daily repetitive ritual of stressing and being depressed. I&#039;ve been on Prozac for 2 weeks 10 mg - have all the side effects but seems to be a break through. I&#039;ll see after a month.""",5
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I started using Phendimetrazine 35mg about 8 weeks ago.  I lost 20lbs.  I was amazed at the results but I also take additional supplements and vitamins too.  I&#039;m being seen by 2 doctors.  One takes care of my general health, the other weight management.  I started out at 190 lbs and now I&#039;m at 170 and counting. I recently started taking the 105mg.  I&#039;m not used to it yet.  It really suppressed my appetite.  If I didn%u2019t think to eat, I wouldn&#039;t have.  I must keep my metabolism active.  What I don&#039;t like about it is it keeps me awake and I don&#039;t get good sleep at night.  I was told to take the 105mg and then the 35mg at dinnertime if needed.  If you have a hunger issue, 105mg is the one for you. Its serious but please eat a little. It works though.""",2
Saxenda,Obesity,"""This medication is working for me.  I have lost 8 pounds in just over 3 weeks.  Unfortunately, because of misquoted pricing from my pharmacy and absolutely no additional financial assistance from the manufacturer of the medication, I am unable to financially continue with the program.  Its a terrible shame that greed gets in the way of human compassion.  I tried to get further assistance in paying for this drug.  I guess $1000+ per month is way more important to the manufacturer of this drug than the person who truly needs this medication to get healthy.""",2
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""Started off on Webutrin (Bupoprion) because Strattera was non-formulary and required approval that didn&#039;t meet my schedule.  Switched, and noticed a dip in mood, but figured that it was some sort of withdrawal from being off Welbutrin. Started at 20mg P.O. for 10 days with no effect, increased dosage to 40mg as scheduled.  Strange dreams, not quite nightmares.  unusual temperature regulation, cold chest, sweating legs.  Started to experience severe difficulty in just getting out of bed, started to have significant irritability and being outright enraged over some things.  Started to experience signs of depression.  Girlfriend noticed and said that she was actually worried about me.   Called doc, was advised to stop. 36 hrs back to normal.""",1
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I had been suffering from depression, suicidal thoughts &amp; tendencies anxiety and nerve damage. I went to a doctor who prescribed me cymbalta and I started on 30 mg. I was on it for about 1 week and I noticed I wasnt eating. I would have to tell myself to eat because I could go a whole day without eating anything. I noticed I did feel a little bit better in my ways but it wasnt enough to keep me motivated to do anything. So the second week I was put on 60 mg. I can say I have never been this motivated ever with school work going out with friends trying new things and actually participating in school. Im 4 weeks in now &amp; ive never been better. Downsides: restlessness waking from sleep jitters and waves of feeling hyper.""",5
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I gave it a 10 because its &quot;effectiveness&quot; is true, it doesn&#039;t  let you get pregnant. That&#039;s our end goal right. 
Yes side effects happen, all birth control has side effects. I spotted a lot the 2nd and 3rd year of the first one I had. Yes mood swings at the end of the 3rd year. I chalk that up to the birth control running out. I would suggest getting it out at least a month before its due to be changed. I waited a week before and the hormones were freaking stupid crazy and I felt pregnant. It all went away when I got the second one put in. 
Overall I love it. It did its job of not letting me have a baby. Not everyone is the same. Try it. If you don&#039;t like it then take it out. Try something else. 
Its not rocket science.""",8
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I was put in the hospital with MRSA IN my lungs. I was really mentally frustrated and was having withdrawals from morphine. I couldn&#039;t sleep and was very ill. This medicine was the greatest thing they could have given me to help me calm down and sleep. I would recommend it, but I will say that it knocked me out cold for the night and I was groggy in the morning. But when I decided to quit taking it, I had no withdrawal symptoms.""",7
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I cannot express how much better I feel and am after trying Latuda. I&#039;m on the lowest dosage, and I felt the effects within the first few days of taking the 20mg. It has been life changing medication but extremely cost prohibitive. I wish that it wasn&#039;t so expensive since it works so well. I used to be irritable, angry and unpredictable--occasionally reclusive and had big manic upswings of extreme activity. I had a hard time being affectionate and open emotionally. Latuda has changed my life. I want to touch my husband, hug my kids and I am not annoyed by everything and everyone around me. I take Clonazepam (Klonopin) with it at night and have not had trouble sleeping at all.""",6
Lorazepam,Insomnia,"""I am going on a 14 hour plane trip and wanted a sedative. I hate flying especially on LONG flights across the world . I got Ativan.

I take an aspirin and I know in 5 minutes I am &#039;medicated&#039;. SO I am majorly disappointed. Now I am even more anxious about my trip. ugh.""",0
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I got my first depo provera shot in May of 2015. I bled for two months straight, but I was warned that this would happen. It was annoying in the summer but it wasn&#039;t super heavy and it all stopped one day. Now, I&#039;ve gotten the shot 3 more times (I think) since then and I haven&#039;t bled a drop! I don&#039;t know why everyone says they&#039;ve bled so much. Also, I&#039;m very happy and I&#039;ve lost 10 pounds since before my first shot. This birth control is the best! I&#039;m only in my first year of it, so I hope I&#039;m not speaking too soon, but it has been a blessing. I would also just like to note, however, that I received my first shot while I was on the 1st day of my period. I think this is important, because the doc said so. Good luck!""",8
Ritalin,ADHD,"""I took 15 mg instant release Ritalin for ADHD, to combat daytime sleepiness, and focus on med school studies. I have mixed feelings about this medication. It improved my focus a lot, but it also had some negative effects. I was very nauseous after taking the pill and would sometimes gag. Nausea was absent on days I didn&#039;t take it. I had no appetite so I wasn&#039;t eating enough, which isn&#039;t ideal because I am already thin and not looking to lose weight. I would try to eat before taking the pill but I did notice either a decreased efficacy of the drug. It also increased my heart rate to about 120 beats per min (I am normally about 75). This did help me feel motivated and get work done, I just wish I didn&#039;t experience these side effects.""",1
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Ambien has been a huge help to me. I have horrible hot flashes whenever I try to fall asleep and end up awake all night. When I take half an Ambien I am able to fall asleep and I do not feel tired or out of it the next day. I am so grateful for this medication. It&#039;s helped the quality of my life substantially. I&#039;ve never experienced the side effects others mention, I simply fall asleep.""",0
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""After years of chronic depression and a significant suicide attempt, I was institutionalised. During this time the supervising psych prescribed mirtazapine.
This drug saved my life.
I am on a high dose, 60mg before bed, but I have noticed no side effects other than more restful night&#039;s sleep (I was an insomniac). My mood is entirely stable now with any depressive episode being minor and totally manageable. There has been no noticeable stupifying effect and I am not in any way sedated. In fact my career has taken off since I commenced taking this drug.
I understand that it is not for everyone, but I am one of its success stories.""",5
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I will never take this medicine again. I was given some 15 mg samples to try. Was on Lunesta, but it wasn&#039;t working. Belsomra did indeed help me sleep, but the am grogginess was terrible. I slept at least 8 hours the night before, but couldn&#039;t concentrate. I was in a fog all day. I fell asleep at the wheel twice and ran right through a red light at a busy intersection. It took all day for this medicine to wear off. Wouldn&#039;t recommend it to anyone.""",0
Phenelzine,Depression,"""Have been depressed and anxious my whole life (now 44) and was undiagnosed.

Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""My doctor prescribed 0.5 mg which I take half a tablet going to bed if that doesn&#039;t work I take the other half. Depends on how much sleep I need or how much anxiety I have. If I&#039;m exhausted the medicine is great  I fall asleep and next thing I know I&#039;m awake in the morning but it usually leaves a hangover which I hate. I try to deal with my anxiety holisticly but  sometimes that does not work. I think it all comes down to eating healthy and watching my sugar and carb and caffeine intake. Walking and doing stretches works for me but honestly  Having someone who really loves you and does not abuse you in anyway is the best answer but I don&#039;t think there&#039;s many people out there like that anymore.   Koliopin is a horrible dangerous drug.   All pharmaceuticals as far as I&#039;m concerned are bad for us and then least we take it the better off we are.""",7
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I am 23 years old and have pretty intense Social Anxiety.  I starting taking Lexapro 10 mg for it when I was 21. The drug was effective at treating my anxiety, but with a trade-off: I felt no emotions.  It made me feel more confident, reduced my blood pressure, eliminated heart palpitations; but, I began to realize towards the end of my use of it that I was feeling no highs or lows.  My social life was great.  I got a girlfriend after not having one for half a decade, and have been with her for 2 years now.  But during my use of Lexapro, all of these successes were just me going through the motions.  Everything seemed surreal to me.  Six weeks ago, I switched to 5 mg, and I am not feeling intense anxiety again. Not sure what it is doing for me.""",7
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""Although I&#039;ve only had Nexplanon since the 29th of July, my first months experience hasn&#039;t been a good one. To this day my period hasn&#039;t stopped for the last two weeks and I&#039;m betting it won&#039;t stop now, which is interfering in my relationship and resulting as unexpectedly costly when it comes to pads. In the first few weeks I also had terrible mood swings, taking them out on my partner felt horrible. Have been considering having it removed already, seems like its not worth the hassle it causes, personally.""",8
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Been on a plateau for 2 years and out of desperation I took Contrave for 2 months.  I gained 6 pounds, not the results I expected.  It did not curb my appetite.  The only weight I lost was in my wallet because my insurance did not cover the cost.  Big mistake!  There is no &quot;magic pill&quot;.  I would rate this as a big &quot;fat&quot; zero (no pun intended), but it won&#039;t let me rate lower than a 2.""",3
Neurontin,Pain,"""I have fibromyalgia and Pars Defect (slipped disc in L5, S1). I take morphine sulfate 30mg 3 x daily, Neurontin 600mg 3x daily. I have noticed a HUGE improvement in the movement of my body. I can actually bend over without falling to my knees in pain. Before I was taking morphine I could tell a difference on the days where I was not taking daily dose of the Neurontin. My body would ache and the pain would be awful and distracting. My arms, shoulders, lower back and shooting/dull ache down my legs would flare up when driving or sitting for a period of time. Now I am able to sit without needing to lay down every 20-30 minutes. The price is reasonable for those without insurance. Hope this helps!""",9
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I had Implanon since Sept of 2011 when my second daughter was only one month old. I&#039;ve tried everything at that point but no other birth control was working for my husband and I. I had periods almost every other month for the first year. A little nausea and a sore arm for about a month. But all that I could handle well the only thing that had me concerned was my sex drive and weight gain. After the first year my sex drive has slowly come back and I&#039;m also slowly losing weight but I have to really work on it. I&#039;m now two years and 6 months into it and I have a fully wonderful sex drive. And I&#039;m still working on keeping the weight off. In December I choose if we want to put it in again and I think I will! Awesome product in my opinion!""",8
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Silenor 3mg for over 6 months now.  I have had zero nights when I have had to get up because of failing to return to sleep.  Most nights I get 7 to 8 hours of sleep.   The only thing different is having vivid dreams most of the time.  Not sure if that means more deep or rem sleep is taking place.  Silenor does not put you to sleep  but it will let you stay asleep.  I highly recommend it for sleep maintenance.""",0
Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo,Birth Control,"""I have PCOS and I had gone without a period for 10 months. My doctor put me on Loestrin. I was extremely moody and emotional, crying over everything and very depressed, plus I was spotting and bleeding almost constantly. Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo is the second pill my doctor prescribed, and I am beyond happy with it. I don&#039;t even notice that I&#039;m taking it. There are no mood changes, I have lost a little bit of weight and it has even helped with my Rosacea. My periods are coming around the same time every month, which is wonderful because I am finally able to know when to expect it, something that I have never been able to do. The only complaint I have is bad cramps, but they only happen in the first couple of days.""",8
Celexa,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking Celexa for about a month now. It helped me a little at first, now I&#039;m having crying spells and feeling hopeless again.  The glass is always half empty. I&#039;m taking 20 mg.  I was hoping Celexa would work.  I had been taking Paxil 20mg for about three years and I was so happy on it! It didn&#039;t matter what was going on in my life. I felt great.  I stopped taking Paxil because it made me sleepy all the time.  I guess I&#039;ll continue for a few more weeks with Celexa.  If things don&#039;t get better I&#039;m going back to Paxil.""",5
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this for of BC because I generally get sick on combo pills. I was told by my PCP that it&#039;d help control my cycle and make a bit more predictable. I&#039;ve been on it for under a month and I&#039;m already not liking it. I started it the first day of my cycle; bleeding seemed to get heavier with large clots (normally med-heavy with very small clots), constant headache, and I&#039;ve broken out with very painful zits on my chin and forehead (skin is generally clear). Skin is oily now as well. I&#039;ll definitely be looking for a different type of BC.""",8
Trintellix,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on 10mg now for 4 weeks.  I was on zoloft before that and was noticing tiredness and being unmotivated to do anything.   

While weaning off zoloft and being on brintellix i did notice more energy and better mood, but now I seem back to how I was before.  My doctor just upped my dose to 20mg and said that should help.  

I did notice increased appetite and it feels like I am hungry ALL the time!  I hope this stops soon.""",5
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I am 27 years old I have had kidney stones while in labor had a c-section and was diagnosed with cluster headaches the most severe pain you will ever know but my chronic back pain takes the win. Those pains go away I might be in excruciating pain for a couple of days put my degenerate disc disease, sciatica and adult scoliosis is none stop pain my doctor prescribed me gabapentin 300mg 3&times; a day but I been on it for 2 months now and all it does is make me want to sleep has not taking any pain away and I have 2 kids I can&#039;t sleep all day even know my pain makes me want to stay in bed I can&#039;t.My doctor has done the epidural steriod injection no relief but galabpentin just gives me bad side effects.""",9
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""We moved to VA after 3 years on orders and my Anxiety came back. My anxiety was situational. I had a refill left on my Zoloft. I filled it but it didn&#039;t work like the first time. Everything felt constricted. Nothing seemed clear to me. I tried Venlafaxine after crying to my doctor and I have been extremely happy. I will say, just like the other reviews mentioned, if you miss a dose, it&#039;s horrible. The dizziness, anxiety, foggy thoughts are severe. I&#039;m on 75 mg and feel great.""",7
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I pass chronic kidney stones and have had numerous stones removed via surgery. A few times my kidneys have shut down via urine back pumping from obstructing stones. In this case a shot of Dilaudid every 15 minutes kept me laughing and giggling with the nurses. Amazing stuff.  For my day to day pain from stones and stone related damage to my urinary tract Dilaudid is really the only medicine which is proven to help time and time again. I&#039;ve been on every pain medicine it seems over the years and while Demerol is a close second, Dilaudid is what keeps me productive at work.  I&#039;m on 8mg but cut them in half as needed. """,9
Bupropion,Anxiety,"""Just a quick note---I actually found it helpful to research the actual chemical this medication works on (norepinephrine), because the side effects make a lot more sense once you can look at the NORMAL effects of increased circulating norepinephrine (if you&#039;re at all prone to hypochondria/health anxiety like I am ;).  I am taking it for depression, even though anxiety is my main struggle....I can honestly say it doesn&#039;t help with anxiety per se, but does turn it into a more &quot;focused&quot; anxiety (i.e. feeling rather hyperactive, but in a productive way as opposed to a paralyzed or hopeless way like with depression).  Has also DEFINITELY decreased my binge-eating tendencies/desires, so yay for that! :)""",7
Belviq,Obesity,"""Well I just started the medication two days ago so I can&#039;t really say yet. But I can say the first day of taking it, I had the worst headache . But today, I haven&#039;t had a headache (knock on wood) I just hope this works, it&#039;s a struggle to shed pounds. I really just need a Jump start. I&#039;m curious what time do you guys take the second pill? Is it 12 hours apart? I will report again soon""",2
Demerol,Pain,"""This medication even though only one half absorbed orally was the best pain medicine I have ever used for my Lupus pain. It worked fast and if I was not in Pain in 3-4 hrs. I did not have a hung over effect. I have not taken this medicine in several years because the pain medicines were swapped to Dilaudid for several years. Demerol is not as strong which was great and did not cause constipation.""",9
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have, very recently, started taking this medicine. The doctor seemed very adamant that it would set me straight and make me super tired and sedate  as well, potentially helping treat my somniphobia as well as the bipolar. The medication has made me so manic that I am having mixed bipolar episodes and seriously feel like jumping out of my own skin. While I appreciate not being so depressed that I&#039;m laying on the floor crying my eyes out, I do not enjoy jittering and being so amped up that I start screaming every time something frustrates me. I am so manic that it is surreal. So much for Geodon helping me out XD""",6
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I started using the Nuvaring because I was having severe menstrual cramps and heavy periods.  I have been using it for 6-7 months now and although it has worked wonderfully for the reasons I started taking it, the side effects are not worth it.  I have fatigue, 8-10 weight gain, widening of my hips, and about a 2 cup breast size increase.  What&#039;s worse is that a lot of the weight gain in around my abdomen so none of my clothes fit.  There is definitely a lack of energy that has interrupted my lifestyle.  
I think its true that Nuvaring works for some women but not for others, just like any birth control.  For me, the experience has been more negative than positive so I am going to stop.""",8
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started taking Saxenda Jan 21, 2016 with .6mg and I weighed 222.  First three days I could not eat, when I did it was very little I always felt sick, but after the three days I felt better. No cravings at all, actually no desire for food, I just eat to eat, and give me energy. I always use to eat sweets after every meal, I have not had one sweet since doing the injections. Today it has been 13 days on injections I am up to 1.2mg and am down 9lbs, 213. I feel good and barely any symptoms. I read that the number one side effect is constipation so I started taking magnesium citrate and I have had no issues with that. I have also started going to the gym. I take the medication right before bed around 11-11:30pm.""",2
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve only had Implanon for 6 months. They say anything can happen so they can&#039;t tell you much about your period. But, in my experience I&#039;ve had no period so far and no cramps or PMS symptoms. 

I don&#039;t believe the Implanon made me gain weight. I was gradually gaining my Freshman 25 in college from September-May and I got the Implanon in January. It didn&#039;t make me gain weight abnormally. I just continued my weight gain from eating such unhealthy food at school. Since then, I&#039;ve lost 17 pounds and I don&#039;t believe the Implanon has slowed down any of the weight loss.

Unfortunately, reviews are not going to help you because Implanon is strictly person to person, when it comes to side effects. In my case, I love Implanon!""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Hey guys. I&#039;m giving an update from 10/20/16. I am 5&quot;3 and My starting weight was 300 lbs. I am taking phentermine 37.5 mg capsule once a day since then. I am being weighed weekly at the doctors office. The first weight in was on 10/27/16 and I was weighed in at 291. So in one week I lost 9 pounds. Today, 11/3/16 I was weighed at 284.6 pounds. I lost 7 pounds for that week. So total amount of weight loss in a 2 week period I have lost 15.4 pounds. Now I do have extreme dry/cotton mouth and also numb/tingling hands and face. Not sure what the deal is with that but upon looking at the side affects that is a side affect listed. I&#039;ll keep updating.""",3
Doxepin,Anxiety,"""I have suffered with severe anxiety and panic attacks, which manifested itself into not sleeping.  I literally stopped sleeping for several days.  Ended up in the ER a couple times and at the doctors all that week and finally had to be admitted to a mental health facility because nothing they were giving me was working.   I literally thought I was going to die.  After 9 days they finally found something that helped me sleep.   It was a combination of Doxepin 100mg, Xanax, Tramadol (which soon switched to Benadryl)  and Ambien.  These drugs gave me my life back and slowly restored my sleep cycle.  After a year or so I was weaned off the Ambien and then the Benadryl, so now I just take the Xanax &amp; Doxepin (now lowered to 50mg).  Amazing.""",7
Adderall,ADHD,"""I started taking adderall in 2012 to 2015 with a 15 month break in 2014 due pregnancy and breastfeeding. I was diagnosed with ADD as a child but held off on taking medication until I was 26. Adderall immediately helped with focus and even energy and motivation. I excelled at work and finally was able to complete tasks instead of starting them and trailing off to something else. In 2015 when I discontinued adderall, I was taking a pretty high prescribed dose of 30mg twice a day. I started noticing the cons of the come downs were outweighing the pros of when the medication was working. I had anxiety, irritability and extreme fatigue. They switched me to dex which was much smoother but has increased my BP. I try Vyvanse tomorrow.""",1
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve heard so many bad, scary things about Accutane. Eventually, I came to a point where I was questioning all this bad press. What&#039;s the worst that could happen?

I am glad that I looked past the negativity and gave Accutane a try. I have never felt so &quot;normal&quot; in my life. The acne on my back is finally clearing up. I don&#039;t have to spend an hour in the bathroom each day messing with lotions, cleansers, creams, gels, whatever. I&#039;m only a couple weeks into it, but I&#039;m not even getting chapped lips or dryness. Just clear skin. Thank you, Roche!""",4
Butrans,Pain,"""I have been using Butrans for 2 months now. I have scoliosis, cervical and lumbar bulging discs. I do get relief from the patches but it doesn&#039;t take the pain completely away. I also am prescribed Vicodin for breakthrough pain episodes. My main complaint is HEADACHES! I have been having the worst headaches so I discontinued the patch for the past week and a half. I am going to resume it today. I will let you know if it&#039;s the patch or something else. I am hoping I can continue with the Butrans because it does give me relief.""",9
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I take 300 mg a Day 150mg am + 150mg pm together with Halodol Vial once a  month and Cogentol tab daily for the side effects  of the Vial. I haven&#039;t suffered from a breakdown since I started taking the right dose 4 years ago.
I only feel dizzy occasionally, and most of the time blurry vision. 
Other than that it seems working good with my case! 
Lately my Dr advised me to try Stimulant 400 cap twice a day to help me stay active while I&#039;m at work.""",6
Effexor,Depression,"""I started taking Effexor in 1995. I had GAD with some depression. For some reason, I let the Dr continue prescribing for 12 years, I was only on 75mg and since it worked, I did not want to temp fate. Last year I started to have worse anxiety and went to one of the highly regarded MD&#039;s in NYC. He prescribed Remeron and Effexor. Eventually the dose was increased from 75 mg to 300mg. It had no beneficial effects. Worse is getting off of it. I&#039;m now down to 37.5 mgs over the last two weeks. The brain zaps and anxiety are tough. I think this drug should be illegal, The withdrawal effects are awful. I recommend trying something else unless this is your last resort.""",5
Tretinoin,Acne,"""My acne got worse in my mid 20s and after trying every tip I could find I finally decided to go to the doctor and he gave me tretinoin . After several research&#039;s I found out that things might get worse in the beginning. And indeed things got worse after a few weeks and I broke out terribly, I cried when I looked in the mirror but I thought &ldquo;just stick with it&rdquo; and trust me its worth it! I know its really hard but when its over its getting better and better (took me 3-4 months to see first results). Also don&#039;t pick because you will have a giant wound after it. Good thing about that; I am not picking anymore :) ! I I also use BP in the morning and zinc, after 11 months I&rsquo;m now getting compliments for my flawless skin! Don&#039;t give up its worth it""",4
Diclofenac,Pain,"""I got this a week ago from my doctor, I&#039;ve been having severe back pain and shooting pain. In the past I&#039;ve tried everything pain killers, lido patches, steroid injections, physical therapy. I put on 2 grams of the gel and the agonizing ache that I&#039;ve had was gone in no more than 30 seconds. I still get the shooting pain but that&#039;s a nerve issue. I really, really love this gel.""",9
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I have been taking Xanax 0.25 for less than four years to control anxiety mainly before sleep. It works really well until it does exactly opposite for its purpose, causing more anxiety and distress. I have been taking Xanax randomly only to relax me before sleep, say 3 times a month, 10 times a month and most of the time half of the 0.25. I noticed that overtime especially in the months I took it more often, the anxiety, the fast heart beats and confusion and strange muscle weakness were getting beyond tolerable. In few words, I would tell anyone there that NO ONE should even begin taking this very addictive Xanax. Better suffer through your difficulties than using Xanax to ease your anxiety and panic. The drug will take you to abyss.""",7
Paxil,Anxiety,"""Let me start off by saying that NOT EVERYONE reacts the same way to the same medication. NOW that being said, Paxil was a LIFE SAVER for me! I am 30 now, and I started taking Paxil when I was 19. The first medication Dr. tried for me was Zoloft, which made my Anxiety get SO much worse! I was terrified to being with feeling CONSTANT WORRY, fast heartbeat, racing thoughts. So after 3 days of Zoloft I quit, went back to my doctor and we tried Paxil. IT SAVED MY LIFE, I felt the unneeded worries of the world lift off of my back, racing thoughts stopped, my heartbeat slowed, I could organize my thoughts. It was like I had calmed down for the first time in my life AND IT WORKED IN HOURS FOR ME(don&#039;t expect same results, but you never know!).""",7
Sertraline,Depression,"""I was having suicidal thoughts really bad before taking sertraline.  I also used to run off from my friend  at Macy&#039;s while shopping with her and one minute I would be standing next to her and next minute I was gone and I kept running off from my mom and my friend Tina and I confessed  to my mom that I have a problem and that I need to do something about it and my mom took me to the doctor and I told my doctor I think I am depressed and he put me on sertraline 25 mg once a day and I found out I was depressed and had severe major depression. Things are a lot better now since I&#039;ve been on sertraline for a long time.""",5
Prozac,Depression,"""I have been taking Prozac for about four years.  My worst symptoms were: very disturbing, vivid dreams that affected my sleep; having feelings of uncontrollable anger; feeling hopeless and powerless, and wanting to give up at the slightest difficulty.  Being on Prozac has been wonderful for me.  The nightmares have pretty much gone away, I am much more calm and patient, and I can deal with the unexpected problems in life much better.  I think Prozac made it possible for me to finish grad school and has helped my career.  I don&#039;t feel addicted to it - in fact, I frequently forget to take it for several days or even a week or more, but when I notice the nightmares or anxiety coming back, I know it&#039;s time for me to take it again.""",5
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""My doctor prescribed me this medicine just two days ago and was able to pick up yesterday and took it before bed last night. I did start to feel drowsy and dizzy. As I tried to get comfortable, my heart was racing, my eyes, legs and arms were restless but my brain was asleep while my eyes were open. I felt like my dr prescribed me speed instead of sleeping meds, on top of that my mouth was as dry as a desert when I woke up this morning and no matter how much water I drank my mouth would not absorb it. Bottom of the story I felt like a tweeker and ended up getting barely any sleep at all. This is just night one, lets up trial nights two and three are better""",6
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking Xanax as needed since I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder,  social anxiety, panic disorder, and a mild case of PTSD. I take .25 mgs, but I usually have to take 2 or 3 when I&#039;m having an episode of high anxiety and/or panic. My doctor won&#039;t up the dosage. It works very well for what it is intended for. It has always been helpful for me to take before doing something that I know will trigger anxiety in me. Since I don&#039;t use it as a drug to take daily, I have to also take Sertraline (Zoloft) every night. The sertraline helps keep me balanced while I use the alprazolam when something triggering is happening or going to happen. For what I need it for, it works great. Calms me down within 30 minutes.""",7
Implanon,Birth Control,"""i decided on Implanon instead of pills I&#039;m horrible with remembering to take them I got mine in 09 had it removed mid October 2014 Implanon works amazing as a form of protection. However I did have crazy side effects I guess that&#039;s the cost of prevention. I instantly gained 15 pounds i hardly ever got periods Maybe every 6-7 months rarely had them went a whole yr with out period but had severe cramps.I was Very hormonal but I will say even though I had all these problems Implanon did what it was supposed to do and I do not regret getting it 3 months after getting it removed I became pregnant with my first child. every womens body is different so everyone experience is going to be different.""",8
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was put on 2.5 mg every night of saphris, about 2 weeks ago. It has been utter hell for me. Not only Did it make my tactile hallucinations worse, it caused more problems than before. I&#039;ve had to go to the ER. I&#039;m more agitated than before. I&#039;m bipolar. Isn&#039;t this a bipolar med? I&#039;m not schizophrenic. And what&#039;s worse is that even though I&#039;m on the lowest possible dose and only taking once a day, after stopping it IM STILL GETTING WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS! And not small ones. Like I said before I had to go to the ER. I&#039;m drinking a lot of water but I still had a extremely low amount of electrolytes. I ended up using two full bags of fluid. This drug is not safe. It does more harm than good.""",6
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I have suffered panic attacks and anxiety since I was 14 and was always an anxious child,  I am 62 now. I have tried just about every medication on the market and none of them worked.  I was lucky enough to find a Dr that said a new drug Klonopin that was a seizure med may help my attacks. I haven&#039;t had an attack in years.  Although I still take it now I am having pvc&#039;s.  Klonopin will most of the time stop them. I have always taken it at night but I am gonna try a half during the day.   I will be seeing a Cardiologist""",7
Retapamulin,Acne,"""I was prescribed this after not having luck with Duac to treat and prevent adult acne.  It took about a week of twice daily application before I noticed a change.  I have been using it for over a month and it has completely cleared one problem area.  It appears that other areas around my neck are now being affected, but I think with continued use it will also cure those problems and prevent further breakouts. """,4
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Got Mirena at my 6 week post-partum checkup. First baby, had him w/o an epidural, and WOW. The IUD insertion hurt worse than childbirth. I bled for 2 MONTHS straight after insertion and my husband said the cords felt like wires stabbing him for the next year. 3 years later and I wish we had money for my husband&#039;s vasectomy. I get brutal cramping almost 24/7, intercourse is painful for me if my husband thrusts too deep, I get intensely nauseous during my period and my period is VERY heavy, I recently got Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, and the cords can still be felt by my husband both the day before and the day after my period.
The only &#039;pluses&#039; about this IUD is that I didn&#039;t have to pay for it and I haven&#039;t got pregnant again.""",8
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Had it inserted an hour ago.  All good. Took 1 Valium and 2 Nurofen one hour prior.  Have bicornuate uterus, significantly retroverted, no kids and am 46.  Had it done during my period which is the norm in Australia.  Inserted speculum and .Dr washed the cervix and gave 4 local anaesthetic injections into the cervix.  Deep breath then cough really helped when she did each injection.  Pain 4/10. As there is adrenalin in the local anaesthetic can make heart race and legs shake.  Stopped after a couple of mins.  Not uncomfortable. Dr Inserted Mirena, stung a little and then voila finished - 15 mins total. RN held my hand, distracted me and reassured me.  Very professional.  Totally different than what I expected after all the alarmist stories.""",8
Accutane,Acne,"""This drug is the best. I&#039;ve taken it twice stubborn acne keeps on coming back.. That&#039;s the only thing, but to others it never comes back.

I don&#039;t have big pimples, small looking ones that are annoying..I also have a lot of whiteheads because my skin is so oily.. I&#039;m going to make an appointment soon.. Accutane works really well.. It clears ur skin like no other..""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""In 2012 I was about 225 pounds, I had high blood pressure but I think that was brought on by RA(since 2007), I finally asked my doctor, the new endocrinologist at the local medical group who diagnosed my hypothyroidism too. If she could prescribe something to help me. I started 12/19/2012 and with diet, exercise and phentermine I went from 217 to 155 (62 pounds) by 11/30/13. It was work, but phentermine cut my appetite to zero and boosted my energy to 10. I never felt sick and as long as you don&#039;t take it after like noon you won&#039;t have sleep issues.""",3

I had my baby girl in March 2016, I decided I dont want to get pregnant soon, having 2 kids now, for now my baby days are over.my age of 23 I can&#039;t get &quot;fixed&quot;, so since I got pregnant with #2 from the pill I decided to go for it and give the depo shot a chance, well, it was the WORST decision I could have ever made, hell I&#039;d rather become pregnant again then keep going with these side effects of being constantly mad and angry, always yelling at my 3 year old and my other half, (my baby girl is always smiles so I never get frustrated over crying or fussy ness, she doesn&#039;t cry lol).

Will not be going back for my next shot""",8
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I have been on the depo for 6 1/2 years. I love it! It works. AND No periods. No weight issues. No crazyness. About a week before I am due for my three month shot I will spot but it is no big deal. My doctor has recommended that I switch to a different birth control since I have been on this for so long and there is debate about bone mass being impacted after long term use. I am sad to switch honestly. I will be switching to mirena and am VERY nervous to try something different. I am only 22 so hopefully my body will adapt to mirena alright.""",8
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I was given Lexapro from my GP for anxiety which I had tried to manage naturally the past two years with various techniques to no avail. My panic symptoms were with me everyday and often suffered panic attack episodes. 
Made it extremely difficult to do 
everyday type stuff let alone work. I
 was always drug resistant..the kind 
of person who wouldn&#039;t even want to 
take a headache med so the thought
 of a drug therapy I would do everyday was 
scary. Anyhow, its early on less 
than two weeks and I haven&#039;t even 
experience any real side effects 
apart from a little tiredness first 
week. I feel less anxious already, no 
attacks and my thoughts aren&#039;t
looping in my head anymore. I&#039;m 
hoping it continues to get better!""",7
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m not actually bipolar-I take it as an add-on to and SSRI for OCD, General Anxiety Disorder, and depression, but that wasn&#039;t in the categories offered. It works wonderful for this for me. My OCD is very much under control taking this in conjunction with Prozac-there are so many things I just could not do and was so afraid of because of the OCD before getting on Prozac and I could do even more after adding Risperdal to it. I take 2 mgs, but I usually take it a few hours before bedtime because it does make me drowsy. I haven&#039;t gained weight from it and really haven&#039;t had any side effects.""",6
Librium,Anxiety,"""My doctor will not prescribe Xanax, Klonopin, or Ativan for anxiety, but he was comfortable giving me a script for Librium (chlordiazepoxide) 25mg capsules 4x a day for my anxiety.  Worked well at the beginning, but like all benzo&#039;s, the efficacy wore off after about a month of use.  Was great while it worked and it was very inexpensive!  Tapered off then went back on it a few months later and it worked like a charm again! On and off usage for close to 5 years now.""",7
Adderall,ADHD,"""This has helped me a lot, but I have a couple tips. There are different brands that people will react differently to (I thought they would all act the same but no). I had a bad reaction with the first generic brand I tried, tried a different generic brand, and had a better experience. So look into that because not everyone believes that there&#039;s such a difference between different brands but to me there was. Second, I&#039;m overweight and thought &quot;decreased appetite? good!&quot; but I would advise to still make sure you&#039;re eating frequently enough. Food has such an impact on brain functioning so not eating for 6 hours because you didn&#039;t feel like it is a bad habit to start! Once I got those slight issues settled, this drug really helped.Just be smart""",1
Propoxyphene,Pain,"""I took propoxyphene several years ago for a neck ache and had good luck with it so when I developed a moderately painful shoulder pain that wouldn&#039;t go away I asked my doctor for it again. I am limited to what I can take for pain because I take anti-coagulants but propoxyphene does not seem to affect my prothrombin-time. It reduces my pain with no side effects that I have noticed. I only have taken it for short term use though, so have no long term experience with it.""",9
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I have used temazepam for over 5 years. Worked great for my sleeping aide as well as for my neuropathy. All of a sudden my doctor pulled it from my prescription list! Due to all this opioid media frenzy I am now stuck trying to find a replacement that will have the same effects for me as the temazepam! 
wish people would stop reacting and just take care of THE PROBLEM!!!!!!! Hope this all passes soon!""",0
Bupropion,Anxiety,"""I used to wake up every day feeling miserable and irritable. I found it hard to think clearly, concentrate &amp; just live a somewhat normal day. I was first put on Sertraline and that didn&#039;t go so well.. I had really bad side effects (fatigue, depression, sporadic emotions) Took myself off that after about 2 months or so. I was then put on this medication! I saw results almost right away with 150ml daily for about 1.5 months with some side effects including dizziness &amp; dry mouth/always thirsty (which I can deal with!) Then because I &amp; my doctor felt there was room for additional improvement I went to the 300ml dose.. it&#039;s only been about 1-2 weeks on the higher dose but so far so good. No complaints! I can actually be free + feel normal again!""",7
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been taking this for about four months now, and I only really have good things to say about it. I take this everyday along with a birth control pill and the results are wonderful. I used to have moderate acne and NOTHING I did helped. This is the first time something really worked and my skin is 99% clear now. Seeing even a small zit on my face is very rare. A few tips though: it took about three weeks before I saw results, and they weren&#039;t that impressive at first, but over time I gradually got better skin. Just be patient. Also, I tended to still get bad breakouts around that time of the month, BUT in combination with a birth control pill, that went away. So, if you have hormonal acne, I strongly suggest this! I had great results.""",4
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My son is 6 they started him off on Concerta he seemed fine we had minimal complaint the only downside is everyday around 7 he would be in moods over silly things, but it would pass. Now the Vayvanse had him in &quot;HULK&quot; mode as he would describe it. He was very snappy and angry and became aggressive with the kids at school, (which was never an issue before). I hated that stuffed. I&#039;m beginning to realize that finding the right meds is going to be a HUGE task.""",1
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I am off Saxenda after 14 months. I started the drug at 250lb and now at 180lb which is my goal weight. I am 47 years old and finally realizing you don&#039;t eat 4 plates of food, you eat one smart plate. Stay away from the junk foods. My wife tells me constantly she notices chicks checking me out where ever we go. If I ever need any kind of motivation to manage my 180 lb. weight, this is it. No one was looking at me when I was 250 because there is nothing nice about being fat. Thank you Saxenda for giving me a life worth living! Now I feel like a have a purpose.""",2
Lidoderm,Pain,"""Lidoderm patch. Rated 6 and 1/2.   Used for 12 hours then off for 12. This was a fairly good addition to my pain treatment for spinal arthritis. I take NSAIDS, Tramadol and add this towards the end of the day when I feel my spine on fire.  It makes a difference but not sure a big enough difference to justify the cost.
Cons- must wear a non-waterproof patch for 12 hours. Patch is no good if you sweat even moderately as it &#039;unsticks&#039;.  It is not re-appliable, can&#039;t take it off to readjust or for a shower so you have to get it right and time it right.
Pro- It does help in a manner that pain medicines and NSAIDS don&#039;t.""",9
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""Female 21yrs old. I have had severe anxiety attacks for the past 2 years, OCD since I can remember, and feel like I can&#039;t breath when I think about the what-ifs. I was on Prozac for a few months and absolutely loved it until I started grinding my teeth in my sleep. I tried the Buspar. I&#039;ve been on it for 2 1/2 weeks. It took most of my anxiety away. But I got so dizzy I couldn&#039;t stand it (15mg). Started halving the pills, still makes me dizzy. Gives me headaches and doesn&#039;t help with the stress or obsessive compulsive disorder. My doc is adding Paxil to the Buspar and hopefully it&#039;ll help more.""",7
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""I read these reviews for over a month before even taking these meds. I will say this, you just have to go for it. Best decision I&#039;ve made in a VERY long time. Abilify has helped me in so many ways! I was at my lowest point. I was severely depressed. I&#039;ve been taking this medication for over a month &amp; hands down I feel great. Yes I still have my days but  they are for sure getting better.. All I want to say is do NOT let what other people say stop you from getting better. Try it for at least 6 wks &amp; judge for yourself. At this point weight gain is welcomed for me. I lost so much weight I&#039;d like to gain at least 30 lol. I am just happy to feel &quot;NORMAL&quot; again. I hope all of you get better. Stay Strong &amp; never give up. Stay Blessed """,5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""The first two weeks were great. I  was shocked that I slept through the night all week. I woke refreshed, not sleepy at all and just so happy.  I even checked there were no antidepressant mixed in the formula. All day, I felt fantastic.
Third week is different.  I am tired during the day and the evenings, I am so tired I can barely make it to 7pm without feeling like I am going to fall asleep standing up. I have a mild headache most days, like my head feels heavy and my nose is stuffy everyday, but isn&#039;t turning into a cold.  I had some strange thoughts after taking the half pill 5mg no hallucinations or sleep was at all.  I am calling the doctor to check if this is working for me. It really was something great""",0
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I have suffered from severe depression for over 3 years, mood swings, irritable, loss of interest, huge lack of energy, absolutely no motivation, anxiety, paranoia, and panic attacks. I was prescribed 100mg extended release 2 times daily and its amazing how quickly it works. I don&#039;t have nearly as many mood swings as before, I have tons of energy (once you are on Wellbutrin you realize just how much depression really affects you without even noticing it), tons of motivation. (I used to debate whether I should do this or that now I just do it there&#039;s no question whatsoever). However it did not help my anxiety or panic attacks, the side effects for me were a very annoying twitching and dry mouth. I have only been on it for a week so time will tell.""",5
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on Belviq for 3 weeks and initially experienced dizziness for 4 days. That&#039;s gone away and I feel great. I have more energy and sleep better. My insurance won&#039;t cover Belviq until I tried 2 other weight loss meds, so I&#039;m grateful for the help with the $75 card from Belviq. I&#039;ve been able to control my eating and resist temptations. And I&#039;m down 14lbs! LOVE BELVIQ!""",2
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I gave this product 3 stars only because I have a high tolerance even though I am a tiny woman, so my experience may not be the norm. That being said, I had been using Ambien for my insomnia for quite a few months and it was starting to take hours before it would put me to sleep. My Dr. recommended we switch it up to see if another product worked better. I took Lunesta for only two nights before I knew it was not for me. Not only did it keep me awake, but it made my heart race and heightened my already bad anxiety. I immediately switched back to Ambien and I will stay put w that. I&#039;m writing this as I hope this helps someone else like me. Had I read some reviews like this, I would have never switched over.""",0
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I first was prescribed 10 mg of Belviq and was happy because none of the other pills I went on worked.  I took my first pill in the morning and it did not affect my appetite nor did I have any side effects.  After one week with no changes I started on 2 pills twice a day.  Unfortunately for me I still did not have a curbed appetite and no side effects.  I am wondering if anyone else took these same pills with no affects at all?""",3
Amphetamine,ADHD,"""Tried all these different medicines and found vyvanse XR worked perfect Until insurance didn&rsquo;t cover it anymore so I took Concerta and that basically made my heart rate go up to 170 BPM and it was ridiculous so I tried a newer medication evekeo and it&rsquo;s good but causes a hell of a withdrawal including anger  diarrhea dizziness nausea loss of appetite but for the most part it&rsquo;s good""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have lost about 30lbs, and gained muscles in the last 8 months while working out 3 days a week. The last 5 months I&#039;m down about 20 inches also. I do have to take it by no later than 9am so that it doesn&#039;t affect my sleep. It&#039;s best to take this as soon as you wake up. If you take it later in the morning or noon it will mess with your sleep! The dry mouth issues went away for me around 3-4 months.""",3
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started on 20 mg of Latuda for bipolar and anxiety disorder. I felt the same as I always do during the first week of starting latuda. Then I upped it to 40 mg a week later and about an hour later I felt super tired , dizzy , confused , slow heart beat , and UN aware of what was going on around me. And to make it all worse I had trouble sleeping. But I felt so weak like I needed to sleep but couldn&#039;t. I&#039;m unsure whether I should continue or discontinue it. Overall rating on this drug would be a 5. Those were terrible side effects and they hit me hard.""",6
Bupropion,Depression,"""I have been taking Wellbutrin for 6 months. It has changed my life. I have suffered with depression my whole life (I am 41) and only finally got help after being admitted to a psychiatric facility. The first two weeks on Wellbutrin were horrible. I had severe anxiety and gastrointestinal issues. I ate broth and crackers for a week! But every single side effect was gone in about 3 weeks. I sure know it doesnt work for everyone, but it certainly has for me. I know it can be scarey to try new medication, but give it a go; it might be the one for you.""",5
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""Has been a life saver to me. I have a very long history with trauma and has caused me a lifetime of serious pain CRPS, FIBROMYALGIA, PTSD . All my doctor&#039;s had said the pain was &quot;in my head&quot;, and hearing someone, who SHOULD understand that you can have unimaginable pain due to trauma combined with other Neurological &amp; Psychiatric issues. Thanks to my Psychiatrist for prescribing this for me..It&#039;s helped with my depression anxiety and insomnia as well. My doctor and I have an incredible bond...A bond that has taken years, decades, to build the most respected form of TRUST. I DO NOT MESS WITH NOR USE MY MEDICATIONS FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT I&#039;M PRESCRIBED. I keep my RXs to myself &amp; hidden well. Do Not Mess with medicine. NOT INTENDED FOR RECREATIONAL USE, EVER!!!!""",9
Morphine,Pain,"""I was in a car wreck about 2.5 years ago, which broke the Harrington rods I had in my back for scoliosis since the age of 15. I am now 28 and feel like I am 80! I have been on Tylenol 3s &amp; 4s, Vicodin 10mg, Oxycodone 15mg, and then Kadian finally helped me. I have been on the Kadian 30mg twice a day for about 9 or 10 months. It gave me hope, although it does take a couple weeks to start to really kick in. No high feeling, and really takes the base pain away. Soon I will have the rod taken out and that probably wont help the C2,3,4 in my neck and the L5 and S1 discs that are smashed and pushing into my spinal cord. But I can give my 5 year old a bath, walk the dog, etc. It is about $383 per month insurance covering the cost! Saved my life!""",9
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I had the same experience as smalltown123456. I have lost 90 lbs over the past 5 years and not lost any weight on saxenda over the past 5 months.  My doctor says I&#039;m a non-responder and amongst his patients there are 3 of us. We have all lost considerable weight before starting saxenda and not had any luck with saxenda helping us lose more weight. I also wanted to share my experience so people know saxenda doesn&#039;t always work as most of the comments are from people for whom the med did work.  It&#039;s dissapointing but hopefully there will be more options soon to help.""",2
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""I had such a difficult time getting this approved through my insurance, however, finally I did for $80.00.  What a huge disappointment!!  I have suffered with chronic pain, degenerative arthritis, and insomnia for years.  I was hopeful after watching the commercial, that finally I would find an effective medication.  To my surprise, all it did was help keep me up all night, some ringing in the ears, and absolutely no rest!!  Anyone who says this medication is helpful, must be experiencing the placebo effect.""",0
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I have had to take this medication (when I try my hardest to stay away from meds) on a few occasions everytime its only taken .2 or .5mg to relieve my panic attack! I love it except my Dr won&#039;t prescribe me anymore for those just in case times and I don&#039;t want to go on an antidepressant. I don&#039;t know if its just my depression but I feel lack of motivation and very tired but that could have to do with it being a sedative too. Would suggest to anyone that just can&#039;t control the anxiety and panic.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Phentermine was the ONLY prescribed weight loss pill that actually worked for me. Before I started the program I had a complete physical by by doctor. When she prescribed this medicine to me, I also decided to change my eating habits. I kicked the sodas, sugars (sweets), fried foods and other junk. I partnered with Diet2Go and order all of my pre-measured food from them. Once my food arrived, I then started taking Phentermine. I only drank pure water with lemon juice - NO SUGAR. I made sure I started taking the medication the same time each morning (9:00 a.m.), ate breakfast, lunch and dinner all in sync, everyday! By the end of the month (30 days to be exact) I went back to my doctor for monitoring - lost 18 lbs in 30 days! It works.""",3
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Mirena 6 weeks after my second child was born in hopes for easy birth control. Insertion was painful, but nothing a little Ibuprofen wouldn&#039;t handle. I bled very light for 6 weeks straight after insertion. Finally my period came regularly it was extremely light but lasted at least 3 days longer than normal (7+days). That was nothing compared to the pain the IUD caused me 24-7, my husband felt it, even 9 months into having it he moved it causing extreme nausea, dizziness, back pain for 2 weeks until it moved back to place. Then lets add the severe PMS symptoms to the mixture, I was miserable. Had it removed 17 months after insertion and would not recommend to anyone. The pain and side effects out weight the benefits.""",8
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 36, have 1 daughter, 14 years old. I am recently divorced and my ex husband had a vasectomy.  I have not had to worry about birth control up until recently.  I am in a new relationship and I needed birth control.  I have several friends who have the Mirena and absolutely love it!  I got the Mirena early June, 2011. I was not on my period at the time, but I did start a week later as scheduled.  It was short, not too heavy, but I have been lightly bleeding ever since (almost a month straight)     It is more annoying than anything.  Everyone keeps telling me to give it another few weeks or so and it should stop altogether. If I keep bleeding, I don&#039;t have to worry about pregnancy anyway. """,8
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""Been taking Qsymia since June 1st 2016,  started at 304 pounds - down to 214 as of today 1/12/17. Kills off my appetite and cravings at night like nothing else I have ever used.  I have hardly exercised honestly and I know that&#039;s not suggested - it&#039;s really just helped me eat less. Which led me to eat healthier overall.  The cost is absurd but so worth it for these results,  my goal is to get down to 185, it&#039;s within sight - unbelievable!  I combined the Qsymia with using a fitbit and the lose it app to track my eating habits,  all combined has worked wonders for me. Good luck to everyone else out there.""",3
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I had been on generic trileptal for years it worked great for mood stabilization . No weight gain or major side effects until I received a different generic version then my iodine levels were terribly low and I lost a ton of weight and felt awful . My dermatologist discovered this because my primary care Dr ran tests and couldn&#039;t figure this out. Years later I&#039;m back on trileptal 900mg , my mood is great yet now I&#039;m having hair loss . My hair is thin all ready . I&#039;m done with this medicine. It&#039;s unfortunate because it works well for moods . Hair loss will defiantly have me depressed .  Not worth it.""",6
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had ParaGard for about 9 months now, and I LOVE it. Insertion was nearly painless, and I love the fact that there are no hormones. I&#039;m still nursing, so I don&#039;t have my cycle back yet. I previously had the Mirena, and the side effects were awful, but I am so pleased this time around! I would absolutely recommend ParaGard to anyone looking for effective birth control with minimal side effects.""",8
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I initially went on it for depression. It worked great. But years had passed and everyday was the same I was never moving forward. I was forgetting a lot of things. I&#039;m in my 30s I felt as if I was in my 70s when it came to memory. The ability to converse normally decreased over time. I would forget at-least 2 words every few sentences and I would forget obligations and functions. When I went off of it my room was clean for the 1st time my car was clean for the 1st time and for the 1st time I wasn&#039;t craving stimulants. I feel alive again.... 3 months off Latuda""",6
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I have pretty severe social anxiety, always have. I have tried a lot of SSRI as well as other drugs over the years. Gabapentin is the only drug that makes me feel at ease. I also take small amounts of Xanax before situations that make me especially nervous. I find that Gabapentin changes my personality somewhat though. I get angry, have paranoid thoughts and tend to believe unrealistic things, and generally care about everything less (which is good and bad). It can be difficult to maintain motivation and concentration to get necessary tasks completed. I have a job in which I have to interact with people a lot and even hold meetings. The positive effects of the gabapentin really make the negative effects tolerable.""",7
Victoza,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve only been on this medication for two days. I&#039;ve tried every appetite suppressant out there. I overeat constantly. I&#039;m at risk for diabetes. My cholesterol is sky high but I still can&#039;t stop eating chocolate. I&#039;m at 0.6 now. No nausea or other side effects. I still crave chocolate and peanut butter and any food I can get my hands on. I need this to work. It seems to work for everyone else except me.""",2
Adapalene,Acne,"""I was prescribed EpiDuo Forte at night and Aczone in the morning. Started December 30, 2016. 36 yo female with cystic acne x 5 months. My derm and myself felt that this combo was not working well enough after 2 months. I&#039;ve just restarted BC and switched to Differin 0.3. I&#039;m noticing a difference already at Day 5. My skin is probably tolerable from the EpiDuo as I&#039;m not experiencing the dryness that some say. Hoping this combo works!!""",4
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started taking Adipex-P 37.5 mg on July 17, 2010 at 252 lbs. It increased my energy level and suppressed my appetite a great deal. I did experience dry mouth at first but it subsided in a few days.  At a weigh in with my wonderful doctor on August 5, 2010 I lost 11 lbs.  My doctor started me with taking the medication for 2 months and then one month off until January 2012 and I now take the medication for 1 month and I&#039;m off of it for 2 months.  I am hungrier when I&#039;m off the medication but I have learned what portion sizes and types of foods to eat and have done pretty well maintaining.  You have to have determination and willpower for the rest of your life.  By the way, it&#039;s now April 7, 2012 and I weigh 148 lbs.  I have lost 104 lbs.""",2
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I&#039;m a 66-yr old female who started phentermine in August.  I lost 12lbs the first month, 6lbs the next month, then 4lbs, and this month only 1lb! Just read all the blogs &amp; I&#039;m going to stop the medicine for 3-4 days then start again.  At my last Dr. visit he upped my dosage to 2 tabs/day.  According to the blogs, I&#039;m taking the tab at the right times of the day and in the right way.  I have an extremely active job and am on my feet 5-1/2 hr non-stop 5 days/week; however, am getting ready to start traveling with my husband in our RV so plan to start exercising by joining Curves/walking.  I&#039;m thrilled with the way my appetite has decreased, don&#039;t think so much about food, and only eat fruits and veggies with regular meal at night.  Constipation is awful.""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""My experience with this drug was extremely negative. I gained about 30 pounds, became anxious and depressed, was extremely tired and sluggish, and ate at least 4 meals/day. I became a very sad and narrow minded person and strayed from my parents and friends. It didn&#039;t help my acne at all so please look for any other alternative before taking this. It&#039;s not worth it and there are so many better alternatives to this.""",4
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I started taking Prozac on Tuesday. I was very hesitant at first. I guess that was based on what I heard about dependency. I was severely depressed after a emotionally abusive relationship ended. I also terminated my pregnancy (my choice) and on top of that I am the single mother of a smart, energtic 7 year old. I guess everything was weighing heavily on me all at once. I had turned to marijuana. I have a stressful job on top of everything else. My issues involved worrying excessively, overthinking every little thing, crying spells, sleeping on my days off. I stopped doing things I used to enjoy. Scary. I never had any suicidal thoughts. I&#039;m a few days in. Felt jittery one day but that&#039;s done. Definitely progressing. Miracle!!""",5
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""My doctor gave me a trial pack of Belsomra 15 mg about 2 months ago. It worked wonderfully. I am now in my second 30 pack of Belsomra 15 mg. It has given me my life back. Now, I sleep like a regular person and wake up feeling refreshed. I track my sleep using the Microsoft Band and have found that I get enough &quot;restful&quot; (I&#039;m assuming this means REM), sleep every night. I want to note that Merck did not want to offer the very low doses of Belsomra as the medication does not work well if you take under 10 mg. My current dosage of 15 mg works great and I don&#039;t wake up groggy. I consider Belsomra a true revolution in sleep medicines. By the way, Merck subsidizes the cost of Belsomra for the first year. Look for the coupon.""",0
Clindamycin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve always had clear skin until recently, my skin isn&#039;t horrible but I never had to worry about pimples on my face.   I have always suffered from chest and back acne.   Been using this about a year now.  Not one pimple now,  this began working at week #1.  Everyone skin will react different to products,  instead of saying it doesn&#039;t work day it didn&#039;t work for you,  because this product is a winner and wonder healer.""",4
Tramadol,Depression,"""I have been depression for over 7 years but in that short period of time I was immediately suicidal. By &quot;fate&quot; I found my salvation. One day I was saying my goodbye to all as I could not live any longer with such sadness and complete doom. I was sitting with my mom and during all the crying I told her I had a severe headache. She only had tramadol. I took two. It saved my life that day and is still. I had tried before and even after all kinds of other medicines and none worked.""",5
Ambien,Insomnia,"""Ambien has been a lifesaver for me.  I have had insomnia since I was a teen, and Ambien has been the only medication I have used that works for me.

There are plenty of &quot;strange&quot; things that can happen if you try to do things between the time you take the medication and onset.  

IMPORTANT:  If you are going to take Ambien, be IN BED, ready to sleep.  It takes effect VERY quickly.

Great medication for insomnia!""",0
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""My experience with it.  The medicine works great for itch relief (pruritis) and anxiety.  I have Graves Disease, this was to treat anxiety temporarily after thyroid storm.  The problem I had with it was it made me to doped feeling to function normally.  I stayed tired and experienced grumpiness and lack of patience.  I&#039;ve taken Xanax, and Elavil before and definitely was able to work, socialize normally unlike this medicine, there is no way I can take it every four to six hours and function throughout the day. I&#039;ve never been one to tolerate antihistamines very well, I get the shakes etc., and  experienced the same with the Vistaril.  All that aside, at night it did help me sleep, help the anxiety as it&#039;s supposed too.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I just turned 30 last month. I started Adipex in November 2012. Lost 10 lbs and thought I could keep going without the pills. Ended up gaining all the 10 back, plus another 10 after all the holidays. I was 230 lbs, 5ft 7 in. I got back on Adipex 4 weeks ago and I am now 210 lbs!! I only get to the gym maybe 3 times a week. I used to get dry mouth, so drank more water. I pretty much ate what I wanted, but a lot less of it considering the pills make me not hungry at all. So now starting strict diet, I should be able to lose more than 20 lbs a month!""",3
Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was  diagnosed with bipolar when I was fifteen years old. I have been on several other medications and stopped taking them when I was eighteen and did not take them for ten years. I developed substance issues with alcohol and drugs to try and self medicate. I had a lot of personal and social problems. I was put on Zyprexa less than a week ago and it has quite literally saved my life and my current marriage. I have not experienced any side effects. I take only 5mg once a day in conjunction with lithium. WOW!""",6
Accutane,Acne,"""I used Accutane about a year ago and it did wonders for my skin. As for side effects, I had dry lips but it was not a problem. I took the medication for five months and it cleared my acne. I had never felt so good about myself. After six months of taking it, my acne came back. I heard that you sometimes have to go on a second round with it before it totally clears your acne for a long time. Accutane is the best and I highly recommend it to anyone who tried everything to clear their skin. It is expensive but worth it.""",4
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""This is the best pill I&#039;ve ever taken for sleeping. I&#039;ve had insomnia for 6 years now. I got prescribed clonazepam, although my doc said it was highly addictive, because nothing else would work. I was desperate (in the time of 12 months before I got on it, I was able to sleep more than 6 hrs maybe 5 nights only), so I decided to give it a try. IT IS A MIRACLE PILL! I can sleep again 8 hrs straight! I don&#039;t feel groggy, drowsy or sleepy AT ALL, actually quite the opposite! I have so much energy in the morning, I feel like a superman! I&#039;ve been taking 0.75mg for two years now 3-4 times a week, and so far did not have to increase the dose! Give it a try, if nothing else helps. And I&#039;ve tried EVERYTHING.""",0
Duloxetine,Bipolar Disorde,"""This antidepressant literally saved my life. I had tried every other medication for bipolar depression, and nothing worked, not even a little. Then after 2 weeks on Cymbalta, the feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness subsided, my mood changed dramatically for the better, I could actually concentrate, and I&#039;ve had no problems with taking it after a solid 2 months. I would call this a miracle pill for those with unmanageable bipolar depression.""",6
Nuvigil,ADHD,"""I&#039;ve tried them all--Adderall, Ritalin, Focalin, etc. Nuvigil is somewhat effective, but I find I can only use it when I&#039;m working alone. Too much people interaction is tough. It lasts so long, which can be good, but sometimes not. Even if I take it at 5:30 a.m., I feel like I can&#039;t drink even a 1/2 glass of wine in the evening. Also, sometimes I feel very dizzy in the afternoon when I&#039;m on the drug. I&#039;m only taking 40 mg.""",1
Citalopram,Depression,"""I took Celexa (citalopram) for about 8yrs. I started at 20mg dose and worked up to 40mg over the yrs. I found I was happier in the summer, and with my doctor&#039;s help would decrease my dose for a bit, but in winter I&#039;d bump it back up again. Mood wise, Celexa did wonders for me. I was able to live happily for yrs. Missing a day or two was hell, between the brain zaps and bouts of crying I was a mess. The downsides: my libido disappeared. COMPLETELY. Gone. I used to have a very healthy sexual appetite. I also gained about 60lbs while taking this pill. I can&#039;t blame it all on the pill, but it didn&#039;t help. Overall it was a great mood enhancer, but take it with warning.""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My experience on this drug started well but has dropped off and I&#039;m looking for an alternative. 

The first couple of months I went from 20 mg in morning and another 20 in afternoon. I&#039;m now at 70 and 40. 

My therapist rx&#039;d Kapvay with it to help with irritability and quick reactions to situations. While it helped the combo was making my teeth feel like razor blades and I was getting abrasions on my tongue. I dropped the Kapvay and it has helped with the teeth but I&#039;m now dealing with several cavities to get filled. 

Also having trouble issues with insomnia as I always feel like I need to be getting something done. Over the past couple of months I&#039;ve probably had 5 instances in which I&#039;ve gone close to 44 hours without sleep.""",1
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Hi. I am diagnosed with MDD, GAD panic disorder w/ agoraphobia, and borderline personality. I currently take Prozac/Fluoxetine 20mg a day, Klonopin/Clonazepam 1mg twice a day. I have always had trouble sleeping due to my conditions, especially anxiety. I have tried ambien,  seroquel, remeron and Restoril.  I got prescribed trazodone when I went to rehab for Heroin. I&#039;m now 1 1/2 years clean, and trazodone has been a miracle. I take 100mg of it at bedtime, and it makes very relaxed and sleepy. I sleep for 6-8 hours, it boosts my Prozac to work even better, and it gives me back my sex drive. Only cons are it&#039;s a little rough starting it, and it gives you dry sinuses. I would really recommend to any insomniac who also has depression/anxiety.""",0
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I&#039;m one of those reviewers who found Pristiq immediately helpful for 3 weeks. Then side effects (jaw clenching, bruising) decreased, and so did benefits. I became depressed again. Doctor doubled the dose.  Benefits did not improve, but side effects were okay, too, until I decided 2x the &quot;normal&quot; effective dose with no improvement wasn&#039;t smart.  I&#039;d taken the drug for 6 weeks, 100 mg for 1 wk.  I cut back to 50 mg and experienced the first rebound effect ever in 40 years of depression and nearly everything available to date. Immediately and severely worsened mood, suicidal thoughts, weepiness. Then I read. Like Paxil, this has a bad record of weaning and cessation effects. Talk to your doctor carefully about the  /- of Pristiq, and be careful.""",5
Ketorolac,Pain,"""I had what was found to be an upper back inflammation, with a great deal of pain.  It was first thought that I was having a heart attack or an embolism.  As morphine-related medicines make me sick (nausea and headache), they gave me Toradol injections while I was in the hospital (for 24 hours) and it knocked the pain better than anything I had taken up to that point. I still had a little pain but it was tolerable, and this medicine didn&#039;t make me sick.  I would recommend it especially for those who can&#039;t take narcotic pain relievers.  Don&#039;t know about the oral dose as I didn&#039;t get that, just injections through an IV.""",9
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""My son started zanatane 5 months ago after trying EVERYTHING  else. This is the ONLY thing that has cleared his skin (took almost 5 months) His Dr started him off w/ 20 mg twice a day..now he is taking 60 MG twice a day.  To those complaining about side effects...his Dr stated he must take this w/high fat foods...peanuts, peanut butter, bacon, etc.(2 help absorb the med)  His 1st 2 blood tests came back a little high so she did not up his dosage. He ate more fat when taking the pills (few scoops pb)&amp; now on higher dose his counts are good.  Do not listen 2 scary stories about this med.  His Dr said she has been prescribing for 12 yes &amp; NEVER had a bad side effect reported (other than dry skin, lips). Wish he went on this sooner (18 yrsold)""",4
Pristiq,Anxiety,"""I take Wellburtin XL 150mg and Pristiq and have been since 2009.  Tried to go off of Pristiq twice because my sodium level is a bit low.  Within a month of being off of Pristiq I got my old anxiety attacks, panic, insomnia, etc., so the positive definitely outweighs the negative.  Hopefully, my sodium will be corrected now that I&#039;m seeing a specialist for it, but for me Pristiq and Wellbutrin XL work wonders and I don&#039;t plan to go off either ever again.""",7
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started taking Saxcenda 4/1/16. It has only been about 3 days and my starting weight is 240. So far at 0.6 mg, I have no side effects at all. The big difference is noticing that I have no appetite for food at all and no cravings for anything! Forget about 3 meals a day, I am thinking about maybe only doing one or very little at each meal. I can understand why my appetite is suppressed because the drug is supposed to play games with your brain, well I guess it is working just fine. I have to start incorporating the treadmill in with this injection along with the low calorie diet. I hope I still feel this good when I start bumping up the doses in the coming weeks, we shall see. My insurance covers this drug with a 10 copay and 10for needles""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I am an 18 year old, sexually active female. I just wanted to start off saying that birth control will act differently to each body. After reading these reviews, I became afraid to get it since weight gain, acne, mood swings, etc. took over for many people. My experience, I got the nexplanon two days before I was supposed to get my period (04/21/15). The procedure didn&#039;t hurt, only a bit of pressure and discomfort. I did not get my period till 8 days later after getting it inserted (normal as the nexplanon does make bleeding irregular), but I had my period only for 4 days like I usually do. So far, I have had no side effects which I&#039;m grateful for. I really do like this as I do not have to worry about anything. :)""",8
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""I have been on saxenda since October. I weighed in at 215 prior and am now 182.8 pounds (I&#039;m 5&#039;7&quot;). I take a lot of medication to help with chronic depression and tied in with major life events and poor eating I was more and more miserable with my weight that I gained in two years, mostly after my surgery for endometriosis (stage 4) and taking Lupron depo (horrid stuff) I just couldn&#039;t shake the weight.  I started this a bit nervous I kept a low dose for awhile, around 1.8 because I had stomach upset but I did take it at night to help with that. I ended up taking the full dose but found 2.4 is more then enough to suppress my appetite. It&#039;s amazing I don&#039;t think about food and need less to feel satisfied. love it!!!""",3
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""Ok,   its funny i found this page because  its perfect for what I want to say.  I&#039;m Diabetic and my foot doc gave me Gabapnetin for the pain  and burning sensation in my feet.   He gave me 300 mg and to take it 3 times daily.    But I admit I now take 1500  mg at one shot in the morning.  ( He said I can take more than what he gave me but he didn&#039;t get a chance to give me a new script.   Anyway,   it helps with my feet maybe 65%   or so but  don&#039;t care what anyone says   no slurring, no falling a sleep or nodding out etc...)   Its great and EFFECTIVE...""",7
Remeron,Depression,"""Remeron has helped me in a great deal. It has helped me sleep which was non-existent for such a long time and I can finally function during the day.  Whoever created Remeron needs to be congratulated because nothing and I tried almost everything imaginable to sleep, has made me be able to get some rest. My physical health has benefited from the rest a great deal.  The only side effect I have gotten is hunger at night when I take it but it is a very small price to pay that can be fought off.  I have not gained any weight but I do get hungry easily though.  I am on 45mg and it is wonderful, I can sleep and then get up and actually want to do things.  I am on it with Cymbalta which helps with my Fibromyalgia. I highly recommend it.""",5
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I have never taken the time to actually write a comment on these types of things, but this is worthy of it. I had never dealt with anxiety until I became pregnant. I suffered with the worst anxiety and I was MISERABLE. I had panic attacks that sent me to the ER..I was too scared to drive, missed weeks of work and literally did not leave the house. I suffered through it until I had the baby. After, my doctor put me on Lexapro. After a few weeks, I felt 100% better. I can&#039;t begin to explain the change I had felt. I was able to do things without thinking the worst of everything. Before I started taking it, it depressed me because I thought I was going to feel that way forever and always have to deal with anxiety. Now, I live a normal life!""",7
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I had my Mirena inserted in March 2011. I had it in for 6 months and kept losing weight... it was GREAT! I dropped about 10-15 lbs. The cons for me were: oily hair/skin, back acne (which I never usually have), and severe unexplainable joint pain. I had it removed 3 months ago due to the joint pain, as it was unbearable. I have started gaining weight (~5lbs) so I&#039;m thinking about trying the Mirena again. """,8
Xanax,Anxiety,"""I started on Xanax after the birth of my second child for post partum anxiety. I used Ativan after my first baby but my new doctor wanted me to try Xanax. I thought it worked great at first. .25 my 4 x a day. Most days I only took 2 or 3. My baby developed colic issues and my husband was working 60 -70 hours a week so I had no help and was going crazy from no sleep and endless hours of non-stop crying so they upped my dose to .5 mg 3 x a day. Things calmed down around 3 months so I tried to cut back down but ended up with severe panic attacks and shaking, etc. Even when I take my regular dose on time I am still struggling with increased heart rate, shakiness, irritability, etc. Hoping to switch meds or something at my next appointment.""",7
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I absolutely love Ambien. Love it. However, building up a tolerance sucks, the drug testing sucks, having to have a doctors appointment monthly to get a prescription sucks, and knowing I&#039;m taking something I know I could become dependent on sucks. No groggy mornings, if taken within a half hour of going to bed I can fall asleep easily, and a few funny text conversations to wake up to. I have tried SO many things and this is so far the only one that has even helped.""",0
Sertraline,Depression,"""Well I went to my Doctor and asked for medication for general anxiety and depression. I was prescribed Zoloft. I took it with a meal and about two how&#039;s later, I felt like I was having a heart attack as I had chest pain, racing  Pulse and palpitations. And I took my Blood Pressure and it was 140/90, Pulse 110. My usual Blood Pressure is 106/70, pulse 75. After about 6 hours, I began to feel OK again thank goodness. I will not be taking this medicine ever again. Going good back to my Doctor and asking for another medicine.""",5
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Doctor prescribed this after a bad reaction to Zoloft. Minus the dry mouth,  I an having great results.  I take 50 Mg. I am able to get to sleep easily.  I still dream,  but it has greatly reduced the tossing, turning and night terrors. I wake up refreshed which is helping to reduce my depression as well. I have none of the dizzy spells or groggy feelings.  This is much better than the Ambien I was on years ago.""",0
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I am a 29 year old male. 6&#039;2&quot;. I started the trial does of Qsymia on 1/16/13 weighing 315lbs. I moved on to the 7.5/46 dose. Today (6/10/13) I weighed in at 221. A month ago I ask the doctor to increase my dose to the 11.25/69mg as I was starting to eat more.  That is when I was not able to sleep and then halfway through taking that dose I noticed I started having numbness in my right foot/calve (which I guess is normal). I already went back to the doctor and ask to be put back on the lower dose even though it will slow my progress. I still have 25lb to go. I hope going back to the lower dose solves this problem. This is not a miracle pill, you HAVE to eat healthy and exercise while taking it. You must make a lifestyle change on it.""",2
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I have neurological Lyme Disease and I currently take 20 mg a night. I also take Panadeine forte for breakthrough pain,  Without the medication I wouldn&#039;t be able to work.  It helps me sleep also which is a huge bonus.  I was reluctant to take it at first because of my experience of being told the illness was in my head.  A good caring doctor convinced me of its efficacy.  I would recommend it as a first port of call. """,9
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""After 12 years on T3&#039;s twice a day so I can walk with less pain following broken back caused by drunk driver, I am starting to see the light (not that one!). I am really noticing a big pain difference and am even skipping T3 doses (unheard of)! I am elated, hoping Doc will be too.  I am even noticing that I am not hungry and have stopped eating regularly scheduled meals until I am. Maybe I&#039;ll drop a few pounds too!  Love &amp; Light, Rev T.""",9
Triazolam,Insomnia,"""Exceptional!  
For me, It takes between 1 and 2 hours to fall asleep.  Therefore, take well before getting into bed.  Once asleep I wake up in approximately 6 hours completely refreshed.
I concur with the others: Do not let your prescriber talk you out of using this extremely effective medication.
PS I only use this medication on an as need basis (2-3 times per month and do not have any underlying conditions).""",0
Lorazepam,Insomnia,"""My experience with Ativan (lorazepam) has been one I&#039;ve come to love and set the bar high when it comes to sleep. I developed insomnia as a result of having to take opioid medication for my CRPS/RSD in addition of the fact that I&#039;m slowly recovering from the death of my best friend who passed in 2010. I have been on every insomnia medicine there is. My current regimen of the normal opiate and muscle relaxants, one to 1.5 grams of Keppra, 555mg valerian root, 10mg of melatonin, 25mg of amitriptyline, and adding up to 4mg of Ativan, depending on the next day&#039;s tasks. Works like a charm every night. """,0
Niravam,Anxiety,"""I have suffered from anxiety and panic disorders for all of my adult life.  When I was diagnosed with Leukemia, my level of anxiety was at at all time high, because it also caused severe bone pain.  My pain-management Doctor had some samples of Niravam. The first week I tried it, my life was changed in a huge way.  It goes to work so quickly, if most effective and the half-life of this medicine seems short, so you aren&#039;t being &quot;over-medicated&quot;.  I&#039;ve suggested it to others with the same disorder, but sadly, most doctors have never heard of it. I appreciate a safe, effective medication and just wish that more doctors were aware that it&#039;s more effective and no or very few side-effects, so they can benefit more patients.""",7
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""After battling insurance to finally cover this med, I can&#039;t say the improvements in depression are worth the 1,000 price tag. After trying numerous medications for over 17 years to help with depression, I was really hoping for more. I would say that as an add on to Prozac, it is only somewhat effective. At first I was pleased by the lack of noticeable side effects compared to other antipsychotics. It didn&#039;t make me groggy during the day, nor did I experience any muscle twitches. However, at about the third month on 20 mg, I began getting severe akathesia shortly after ingesting. It manifested with inner restlessness (not normal for me), anxiety, and inability to stop moving. For me, this has gotten so unpleasant that I&#039;ve decided to stop it.""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Been on generic adipex for 1 month. Start weight 183. Current weight 171. Drink lots of water on this. Dehydration can cause headaches ( get migraines already so this did not increase due to the medication). First day i was nauseous. first week was extreme dry mouth and complete lack of appetite. I had to remind myself to eat during the first week. At some point during the second week i was feeling a bit hungry but not the constant hunger i experienced before. As of the end of the first month the only persisting side effect if the dry mouth. I&#039;m also not sleeping very well! but I just take tylenol pm for that. overall i feel good. i&#039;m losing weight. im less hungry so i&#039;m selecting better food choices. (chocoholic lol) and no serious issues.""",3
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""I am a recovering drug addict suffering from severe anxiety. My drug of choice was benzos so clearly I cannot be prescribed those (or any other narcotics). While I was in rehab I was prescribed gabapentin, 300 mg pill three times a day. I was convinced that it wouldn&#039;t work because it was a non narcotic but this drug has helped me so much, I feel like I have complete control over my anxiety. However when I miss A dose or two in a day I do have withdrawal symptoms.. as long as I take it as prescribed I feel amazing with almost no side effects.""",7
Fentanyl,Pain,"""I have low back pain for 15 years with severe chronic pain for the last 5 years. Like many other posts I have been on many different pain medicines from Lortab to Oxycodone. In 2008 I had 4 discs fused to relieve my most severe pain. Two weeks ago I started pain management being prescribed the Fentanyl patch and Oxycodone for breakthrough pain. The Fentanyl patch has been great. I don%u2019t have the ups and downs in pain because I forgot to take the pills at a certain time. My pain is well controlled with little breakthrough pain and the side effects are far less than the oxycodone alone. I wish I had this a year ago. I see bright days ahead.""",9
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I have tried over 20 different medications, and Trintellix is the best fit for me. I always describe its effect for me as &quot;being able to turn everything down in my head.&quot; I can see how this might not be a good fit for others as it might certainly aggravate &quot;feeling nothing&quot; or &quot;feeling detached.&quot; However, as my issue is primarily that I feel TOO much and am unable to step back from my emotions and intrusive, racing thoughts, Trintellix&#039;s &quot;detachment&quot; is extremely helpful for me. 

I do get nausea for the first week upon taking Trinellix or upping my dosage; however, this subsides for me. I was on 10mg for 8 months and have now increased my dosage to 20mg in hopes of it being even more effective.""",5
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Had the Mirena inserted 2yrs ago, 3mths after having my daughter via c-section. I had a monthly period still. I had cramping every now and then, like sharp pinching feeling. My IUD checks seem that it was in the right place just a bit lower in the cervix. I&#039;ve had pregnancy symptoms this last month. I even missed my period. Well I went to the hospital the other day since I was having contractions. I wasn&#039;t pregnant, but my contractions were strong enough that it was pushing the Mirena out. The doctor examined me and said it would have came out within a couple weeks. It was very low. """,8
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have had a negative experience on Seroquel. I do not want this to deter anyone from taking it, as everyone&#039;s reaction and experience on this medicine is subjective; I just want to put this out there for anyone who might be experiencing similar symptoms and reactions and may be hesitant to say it and to just relate my own experience.
I am Bipolar 2 and have untreated ADHD due to the ADHD medicines causing manic episodes. I started Seroquel 2 months ago when I was having a bout of insomnia. I should state that I was on Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Paxil, and was feeling good. I was productive during the day and upbeat. I was prescribed Seroquel for the insomnia and taken off all the other except Lamictal. I am now a &quot;zombie&quot;, depressed, sleepy 24/7.""",6
Amnesteem,Acne,"""I started using this medication...You cannot drink, need two methods of birth control, lips chap badly, skin gets dry and gets rashes, trouble going to restroom, severe mood swings, always feeling sleepy and tired, started feeling depressed and suicidal. That&#039;s the possible down side...I started taking it about two years ago. My treatment only lasted about 4-5 months, had to cut my treatment short because of depression. It worked wonders on my skin. My skin was really REALLY BAD BUT My dermatologist told me that if ever I were to get 3-4 pimples at the same time, to consult him asap. My skin had been absolutely clear for a year....a couple of months ago, I begin to notice bad acne reappearing.""",4
Minocycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m 32 years old and I was suffering from unwanted blemishes constantly. I was desperate to try anything to clear my skin - my last straw was seeing the dermatologist. I&#039;ve now been on Solodyn for 3 months and my skin is nearly flawless with a small blemish rarely.
Unfortunately my trade off for clear skin seems to be weight gain from Solodyn. I have been the same weight my entire life no matter what I ate. But since one Solodyn I have gone from 155 pounds to 170 pounds in 90 days and I&#039;m even starving myself. Has anyone else had this side effect? and if so I hope the weight drops when I stop taking them. Help!""",4
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I&rsquo;ve been taking Victoza since early August for type 2 diabetes. At a once daily dose of 1.2mg it has been moderately effective at lowering my blood sugar to 130 or less. It&rsquo;s greatest success so far has been helping me to lose weight. I&rsquo;m down 20 pounds so far without diet or exercise. My appetite has plummeted since I started Victoza. I simply cannot eat anywhere near what I used to. I often end up skipping meals simply because I&rsquo;m not hungry. 

Side effects, including nausea for a few weeks when I first started taking Victoza and ongoing mild constipation, are easily manageable considering the benefits of taking this drug.""",2
Vistaril,Pain,"""I take Oxycontin 60mg 3x a day, and Roxycodone 15mg 4x a day for chronic back/neck pain. Sometimes I do too much walking, or get severe neck pain that the pain meds don&#039;t control. I add one 25mg Vistaril and it enhances my pain meds effectiveness. About 3 to 4 hours later I become EXTREMELY drowsy, and often fall asleep, not good in the middle of afternoon! I think the occasional Ativan is almost as helpful, w/o all the sedation. Good drug, only if I can afford to be asleep.""",9
Bupropion,Depression,"""I am making this solely because I remember looking up reviews of antidepressants before I ever took one and being terrified of what my life might look like if I started taking one. I took Lexapro for 3 days and felt like a zombie, and swore off antidepressants. However, my depression continued. Thankfully my roommate who is also a 21 year old junior in college told me about her positive experience. I feel like a completely different person now. The first two weeks my emotions were all over the place, and my anxiety was high. Anxiety is still factor sometimes, but it gets less frequent every week. At 5 weeks on Wellbutrin my life has changed for the better. I finally feel like I can live the life that I was meant to. And I&#039;ve lost weight!""",5

Since that time no new acne has sprouted and existing acne has significantly improved.  Doxy and differin is an interim solution as my derm believes acne outbreak is hormonal.

Vilazodone,Depression,"""I was one if the unlucky ones, and experienced a ton of negative side effects from Viibriyd: sleep paralysis, falls, insomnia, increased anxiety/panic, loss of concentration, a carnival of digestive effects, dizziness, loss of appetite, forgetfulness, etc. Each increase in dosage made the side effects worse.

If I&#039;d had a fraction of my usual judgment I would have asked to be taken off of it after the first week.

I&#039;m currently tapering off, and for me, the withdrawal symptoms are totally preferable to the side effects.

Viibryd is great for a lot of people, and that&#039;s awesome. If it is making you feel worse than when you started, stay in close contact with your doctor and do not hesitate to question whether you should stay on it.""",5

I then haven&#039;t experienced a heavy period, just spotting and light bleeding. My only issue with this is having some symptoms of pregnancy which is common but I am a bit paranoid all the time that I could be. I&#039;ve just got married 3 months ago and had liletta inserted 4 and a half months ago. My husband and I started using condoms as a second form of protection.  But we are not sure how long we will use it for, we really are not trying to get pregnant.""",8
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I thought I&#039;d write a review as I spent months reading these forum&#039;s trying to decide if I should try escitroplam or not. It took me months to get the courage up to take it. I started at 2.5 and bumped up to 5.  I&#039;ve been on 5 for about 5 weeks now and wow what a difference.  Anxiety and panic attacks minimal and depression lifting. It&#039;s a very good drug. The least side effects of all I&#039;ve tried. Headaches,nausea but that&#039;s all. Very happy with this. I was extremely anxious about taking this after a bad experience with prozac but I&#039;m very pleased!""",7
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I suffer from serious anxiety which had been making it really hard for me to fall asleep, taking 2-4 hours to fall asleep and then when finally sleeping I&#039;d always be waking up 4 times in the night and after two months of this, I was completely exhausted and went to talk to my doctor who prescribed me zolpidem. This medicine knocks you out right away but be careful - go straight to bed after taking it, because it kicks in fast and strong and the effect it has is kind of like being completely wasted and you&#039;ll end up doing silly things. If you go straight to bed, you get a good, deep 6-7 hours sleep, which feels amazing! It&#039;s so strong that my brother tried to wake me up once when I fell asleep on the couch and he couldn&#039;t! That NEVER happens!""",0
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve only been on it for a few days, so it&#039;s hard to tell.  I have GAD and my symptoms are flu-like in nature.   I saw my anxiety go from the cliche butterflies in the stomach to having diarrhea and vomiting/nausea whenever I was in strange social situations. After 15 years of dealing with this I went in for help and was prescribed Buspar. At first, no side effects.  But last night I felt the &quot;electric&quot; pulses at work and was pretty dizzy for about a half hour.   I take 10mg 2x per day.   Hopefully these side effects will mellow out.   I&#039;m wondering if caffeine might have a counter effect?   Had coffee shortly before taking the pill. """,7
Buprenorphine,Pain,"""I started off on 5mg they had no effect so Gp upped to 10mg. By the second day the pain had reduced substantially and things felt good. I&#039;ve suffered for eight years with sacroiliac pain S1, herniated discs L4/5/6 at base. Just had successful total hip op. However I&#039;ve had to come off them due to the very bad side effects, nausea, crawling itchy feeling under the skin,unable to sit in the sun and if I did suffered greatly, irritability, very low mood, and worst of all hot flushes. I&#039;m back to my old self now. When peps start telling you you&#039;ve changed, it&#039;s no joke and was very relieved to get them out of my system. Having said that, I know they work for some.""",9
Nortriptyline,Pain,"""I just started on this drug 2 weeks now. My doctor prescribed it to me to help deal with my concussion headaches and to help me sleep. The pain-free aspect is quite lovely, however 2 weeks in, and I&#039;m suuuuper groggy. It doesn&#039;t help me sleep, but I didn&#039;t have a problem with that - it was just the post-concussion headaches. My doctor&#039;s main goal seemed to just send me back to work. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t have to drive into work today because I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d be up for morning rush hour traffic. She only prescribed one month&#039;s worth (10 mg pills) &amp; I can&#039;t wait to be finished with it. I have noticed a large increase in &quot;chubbiness&quot; around my mid-section. I notice that some weight gain is one of the side effects as well.""",9
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I took the first injection in my doctor&#039;s office November 15, 2017.  It&#039;s only one week but I&#039;m down 8 pounds and feel like this may be what I need.  I need to lose just over 100 lbs.  I feel a little nauseous at times, but the appetite has dwindled and barely any cravings.  Eating anything really sweet or sugary tastes disgusting.  I&#039;m taking this with Invokana so I&#039;m not sure how this all works long term.  Unfortunately, my drug insurance may not cover this.  I certainly cannot afford to pay for more than a couple of months.  I&#039;m currently being checked for PCOS.  So whether or not that makes a difference, I&#039;ll have to wait and see.  I&#039;m glad this available and I think this is what is going to work for me.""",3
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I am 36 yrs old and I have had my nexplanon for almost 3 years now (2 months shy) and I have had a couple of the side effects but nothing to bad or I couldn&#039;t work through. I was just talking to my obgyn about setting up my appointment to get it removed and she said they just OK-ed it for 4 years so now I don&#039;t have to worry about anything for another year. I&#039;m a woman so between stress, a 3yr old, financial issues, family problems and baby daddy problems I&#039;m going to be moody, have headaches, bleed irregular sometimes cuz of stress, loss of appetite, get depressed, gain weight so I DO recommend it but everyone&#039;s body is different so I have to find what makes u comfortable.""",8
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed this a few months ago getting anxiety while driving. The prescription is &#039;0.5 mg once a day as needed.&quot; I have taken it about 3-5 times a week, a few times I have taken it twice a day. I have been having family issues recently, and I first thought that was the reason my occasional anxiety has progressed to debilitating (flying off the handle, depressive dying thoughts, chest pains) but  after research I&#039;ve concluded that I&#039;m actually going through withdrawal when I don&#039;t take it everyday. Now it&#039;s 2:36 AM, I&#039;m scared, mind won&#039;t shut off,  don&#039;t know how to wean off of this properly. I&#039;m  tired, will be calling into work in the morning for lack of sleep. Please do not take this and just get counselling for your anxiety first""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;m 30 years old weight 210lb and started using Contrave 8/8/2017. I haven&#039;t had to deal with all the negative side effects that come with this drug thankfully. I&#039;m wanting to lose 60 pounds by May 2018. Don&#039;t know if I have lost any yet told myself I wouldn&#039;t weigh in till my doctor appointment on 09/05/2017. I do feel that it&#039;s working I don&#039;t feel like I have to eat all the time which I like because that is why I started taking contrave. All in all I&#039;m liking contrave -  it&#039;s doing what I wanted it to do. Will update after doctor appointment. Good luck to the rest of you on your weight loss journey.""",2
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve recently got my second implant inserted. I loved the first one. It hurt going in but to not worry about buying and taking birth control for 3 years was worth it to me. I was also one of the lucky ones who didn&#039;t have a period for two years. Then the final year I did start having a period once a month. It lasted about 4 days but I was pretty sick those 4 days. I&#039;VE gained a little bit of weight and my acne has been pretty bad, but it was the same as other birth controls. Now this second one has given me extreme moodiness, hot sweats and cravings. Still no period so far but I feel like a bat outta hell lately. I didn&#039;t experience this with the first one. I just had it done a few weeks ago though. All this said, I like the implant for me""",8
Pristiq,Anxiety,"""I was very reluctant to go on medication but my anxiety that was overwhelming increased to such an extent I was very unmotivated professionally and personally. For the first 3 days I felt very nauseous and had little appetite which was great as it stopped that overeating I had. I lost 2kgs within the first few days and then suddenly the nausea was gone, my head was very clear, I have been able to concentrate again and am genuinely surprised at its effect only a week and a half in.""",7
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Lunesta for two years.  It has been wonderful.  My wife appreciates the fact that I sleep all night now.  I can set my clock by it, consistently wake up at 7 hours, refreshed.  I have tried the 2MG and does not quite work.  3MG does the job for me. I have no problem waking up to answer the telephone or help with the kids, and then go right back to sleep.  Good stuff, but expensive.  My wife says it is worth it.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I took phentermine in 2002 on and off and lost a lot of weight. I started again on Tuesday 24 June. I currently weigh 195lbs and am 5ft 7. I wanted to ask people this forum who have had a good weightloss if they took the tablet or capsule and also if they have changed their eating habits and if they count calories? When I took it years ago I don&#039;t recall eating a lot, but now I was told I need to eat 1200 calories in order for it to work successfully. Is this correct? Thanks in advance for reading and responding.""",3
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""started Saxenda mid June and lost 25 lbs in 2 months, and now down another 6 lbs in the last 2 weeks, main side effect for me is the nausea, still have it, was sick twice, but I can handle the nausea as I am so happy to be losing weight, I have tried many things in the past, and this is by far the best, completely cuts my appetite, I don&#039;t even eat half of what I used to, and no desire for junk food.
Luckily my insurance covers 80%. I feel better than I have in a long time.
Also, started walking every night. Total weight loss since June 11, 31 lbs.""",2
Zoloft,Depression,"""This medicine is terrible. In fact doctors are terrible for prescribing it. Thanks to a 15 min session of my psychiatrist nodding (while barely looking at me) then writing down a name of a pill to &quot;fix me&quot; my face has never seen such acne. He thought I was depressed before, now I don&#039;t want to even leave the house. DOCTORS OVER PRESCRIBE!!!!! Please trust me, go to your herbal neighborhood store and get things to detox from medicine. The pharmaceutical companies are making a fortune on society believing a magic pill will sustain our life and subdue our problems. You&#039;re smarter than that, right?""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I had no significant problems with the Isotretinoin. My extremely oily skin prevented the medicine from drying out my face, however my lips did become extremely chapped. I suffered none of the harsh side effects, but I did do my part by staying out of the sun. The only problem I had was near the end of the five months. When winter hit, my eczema flared up and I have not been able to get it back to normal. My feet also became very dry and cracked, which is not normal for me. Considering those are the only side effects I have suffered, I am very pleased with the results. My oily skin is not nearly as bad as it was and I have not had a pimple show up in the two months I have been off of the medicine.""",4
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I work an off shift. I gained 40 lbs my 1st semester of college.  Im 23. 6 ft tall 38 male waist. Suffer from weight anxiety.  Been dieting and exercising 4 to 5 times a week. For the past 2 years religiosity. only got bigger and was always starving and p.oed. My 1st month after getting this med from my doc I&#039;m down 13 lbs.  My face and belly look like a past picture. I hope to see more changes. I started at 230 now I&#039;m 217. My 1st goal is 200 then my crazy goal is 180 and 34in waist. I&#039;m tired of my pants &quot;shrinking&quot;. Also  the dry mouth was a pain the 1st couple days drink lots of water. And it keeps me up at night. Running around in my brain. Then I&#039;m not sleeping as deaply as normal but its worth it I&#039;m finally eating less. And full.""",2
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro (escitaploprgram) since February. First, I&#039;d like to mention that you can NOT take this drug for a week or less and expect to magically feel better; I felt really sick the first two weeks on this drug. But you HAVE to give the drug time. For me, I didn&#039;t really start noticing the drugs positive effects for about two months. I took Zoloft before this and felt like it made me too tired and absent-minded. Luckily, Lexapro doesn&#039;t seem to have this effect (although I do drink caffeinated drinks). I like Lexapro not only because my anxiety and depression is completely gone, but I feel like I can finally handle everything in my life now (I&#039;m a working full-time college student). I highly recommend this drug.""",7
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m 45 years old and have lived a pretty normal life except for my occasional heightened anxiety. Recently, my anxiety and panic attacks had escalated out of control. I was feeling out of touch with reality and having multiple panic attacks a day. Unfortunately for me, after 2 doses the Effexor caused mild hallucinations; light pixelating and things moving in fast motion. It was adding to my anxiety so I went off immediately and the hallucinations went away.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been taking this medication for about 6 weeks and have lost 12 pounds, including 5 inches off my hips and 2 inches off my waist.  I exercise 5 days a week.  It is an intense work out which includes cardio and weights.  I do not feel as hungry all of the time like I did before.  I drink a gallon of water a day if not more.  I have experienced a few side effects like dry mouth, rapid heart rate, some constipation, and headache.  I want to continue until I reach my goal and do not want to give up!  Seems like in the past I always give up, but not this time.  This works really well and highly recommend this.  I have 25-30 pounds more to go!""",3
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""I could no longer tolerate Requip for my RLS, so my NP put me on gabapentum. Gabapentum nearly halted the RLS totally but also caused my peripheral neuropathy to diminish greatly. Another doctor said that result would be expected. Getting only 4 hours of sleep before I get up for some coffee. Two hours later&mdash;about dawn&mdash;I can get another hour of sleep easily.  (Another hour of nap after lunch). So I can&#039;t speak to sleeplessness, as I&#039;m taking a bunch of other medications (stent installed).""",0
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I have been on Effexor for a few years with virtually no side effects. However my dr recommended this new medication based on excellent reports on its success. I took it the first day at bedtime, slept like a rock with lots of dreams and woke up feeling like I hadn&#039;t slept at all. Slept most of the day with mild nausea and no appetite, but knew I had to eat something to overcome the nausea. By evening, the nausea was gone. Took another dose that night..same thing, but work up feeling quite nauseous which I suffered from all day and night. I had flu like symptoms for the following 3 days and decided that was enough for me as the nausea never eased up. I have been off the med for 3 days now and still have mild nausea. Won&#039;t be taking anymore.""",5
Diclofenac,Pain,"""I have lived on a formal pain regimine for many years.  Among other conditions, I live with psoriatic arthritis and deal with IBS/here from sensitivities to some medications.  My internist prescribed Voltaren Gel for me a few years ago. My pharmacist told me to use it sparingly, that with this product less is more.  I have followed her advice and use it on an as needed basis for pain that my regular meds  just don&#039;t  seem to control.  Like when I blew a tendon in my foot walking my Service Dog or when I fell and wound up with a non-displaced fracture of my tibia.  Using Voltaren Gel helped me control the pain so well that I was able to walk with a cane.  It is AMAZING how effective it has been for me.""",9
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""Depo shot 
EASY, FORGET ABOUT THE PILL! 
I started the depo provers shot after having two kids birthed one year one day apart! Both times I was on the full pill! 

Was easy price is $11.48 every three months on health care card. Wasn&#039;t a stressful process was easy pain free. 

I did bleed the first injection 10 out of the 12 weeks I bled heavily but after second shot I have over-come that and I am extremely happy in the success of this needle.. 

It&#039;s not costly, it doesn&#039;t hurt, it&#039;s once every 12 weeks, don&#039;t need to stress about babies and pregnancy, people are different some will bleed some won&#039;t! Yes a tad weight gain but hey weight is better then an unwanted pregnancy """,8
Tramadol,Pain,"""My shrink put me on this in 2010. I was overdue for a hip replacement, and it showed when I hobbled into his office! Combined with ketoprofen 75 mg (best NSAID out there for pain) 100 mgs twice daily got me through for 5 months till surgery. Excellent synergistic effect. Still take it with the NSAID since my spine is arthritic, and my knee is ready for replacement now. Problem is my family doc no longer prescribes NSAIDs because of heart and kidney concerns! He thinks 3 tramadol daily is sufficient! """,9
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Starting weight 280.  In Sept. of 2016 I started taking adapex (phentermine) and took that for 3 months.   I lost about 20 pounds in those 3 months.  I had severe dry mouth, heart palpitations, insomnia and constipation.   When I switched over to Contrave I only experienced a slight bit of dry mouth and sleeplessness with a slight elevation of my blood pressure.  I took Contrave for 9 months and lost another 50 pounds by eating right and exercising.  After stopping Contrave I have regained 12 pounds in 6 months.  Mainly due to not exercising and significant increase in appetite.  I will retake the medication and will update my progress as I work toward my goal of 190.  This is a good medication.""",3
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I am a 33 yr old woman with Anxiety, irritabilty, ocd 
. I have been on many different medications since i was 18. My new doctor finally sent me to a psychologist to see if effexor was the right drug for me after being on it for 18 months with some improvement but not great improvement. At the time I was on 75 mg a day. The psychologist upped my dosage to 200 mg a day. Since then I have had very slight anxiety, and only when even a normal person would have a panic attack. My OCD is manageable. And I no longer wish everyone dead. I have had 0 side effects what so ever.  Only thing I have noticed is when i miss a couple days, (mom of 3 it happens), all my problems come back 100%. I never take my meds at the same time and have never had withdrawal.""",5
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""I started taking Loestrin 24 FE 2 weeks ago to prevent pregnancy and my face is breaking out like crazy. Plus I&#039;m getting killer mood swings, which is just lovely since I&#039;m already on an antidepressant (I&#039;m on it for anxiety not depression though). I&#039;m gonna give it until I finish this pack and if it&#039;s not better, I&#039;m heading to the doctor and getting my birth control prescription changed.""",4
Klonopin,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking Klonopin recently, and I&#039;m mixing it with Vybriid and Lamictal. It helps so much. At night it takes the edge off. I take 0.5mg, sometimes 1mg to help me out more. I haven&#039;t had as bad of racing thoughts while I&#039;m trying to fall asleep and I end up sleeping like a baby. The after effects is a little bit of groggyness but it&#039;s worth it. The only thing that bothers me is that I feel like smoking cigarettes after I take it. Overall, it&#039;s great and stops the mania as well as depression.""",6
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed Klonopin for anxiety several months ago. The dose was 0.5 mg up to twice daily.  Never having had it, I quartered a 0.5 mg tablet first dose. Seemed okay until a few hours later and I began coughing like mad. I have asthma.  Klonopin made me cough and increased the thickness of the mucus in my lungs until it was almost impossible to cough it up.  Just to be SURE it was the Klonopin and not something else, I have given it two other tries 1/4 of a 0.5 mg tablet.  Each time the same results.  I looked it up and &quot;cough&quot; is the 2nd most common side effect. FYI Naproxen and ibuprofen have the same effect on me.""",7
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I warn you to be VERY careful with regards to this medication. I started taking it in July 2012, and was at one point up to 120 mg a day. ( I absolutely no longer see the &quot;Dr&quot; who had me on such a high dose) It caused me to suffer neurological damage that took over a year to correct itself. I had involuntary muscle movements, rocking motions, tremors, as well as having to learn how to walk again normally, as it caused marked damage to the left side of my body. I was treated with physical therapy twice for the condition this medication left my body in. It is just not worth it!!! Do your research, as I am sure you are, since you are in this forum. This medication is even more dangerous than desribed!!""",6
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I had trouble functioning during the day because I couldn&#039;t fall asleep until 1 or 2 am, then had to get up at 6 am.  My doctor prescribed 10 mg Ambien (not CR) but because I&#039;m small I decided to cut one in half the first night.  I was able to sleep soundly almost immediately after my head hit the pillow and I slept all night.  That was about three years ago and I am still taking my half pill per night and sleeping well.   I have occasional times (maybe once every two months) that I don&#039;t sleep well with them, but I don&#039;t blame the pill for that.  Follow the directions, if you don&#039;t it isn&#039;t the fault of the drug, it&#039;s your own fault.""",0
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""Wellbutrin is absolutely miraculous for me. The last nine months of my life, through which I&rsquo;ve been taking Wellbutrin, were the best. I used to have dysthymia, apart from occasional episodes of major depressive disorder, and Wellbutrin put an end to both. 

The only side effect I noticed is a rise in my blood pressure (hence 9/10 instead of 10/10), which I&rsquo;m not entirely sure I should attribute to the drug. But I&rsquo;m young and my blood pressure used to be very low, so I am fine with that. I plan on continuing to take Wellbutrin, until someone stops me!""",5
Belviq,Obesity,"""I have been on belviq for 5 days and I&#039;m down 2 pounds...my starting weight on Monday was 251 and now I am 247.  I have cut back on eating due to not feeling hungry all the time so that helps me count calories so I don&#039;t over eat but I will say that you need to make sure that you eat breakfast in the morning.  Don&#039;t forget to download Myfitness Pal to help. Side effects: I had a headache, drowsiness/dizziness the fist day but that seem to wear off the first day or so. Good luck everyone and I will keep you updated on my weight loss. Adding exercise this week everyday!!""",2
Phendimetrazine,Obesity,"""I have been using this drug for 1 month, and I have lost 11 pounds so far. I still have 20lbs to go. I had been exercising 6 days a week, for at least 2 horus a day, with lots of cardio, and the weight wouldn&#039;t come off, until I started on the Phendiet. Since starting, I reduced my exercise to weight lifting and swimming 1.5 hours a day. My only concern is feeling like my blood pressure drops and  like I need iron. I meet with my doctor every 2 weeks.""",2
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""Before I took latuda, my bipolar disorder was pretty much ruining my life. I started latuda and about 2 months later, while I was starting to feel so much better. I also noticed that I was starting to feel overwhelmed and was starting to become delusional and developed irrational fears such as being scared to even go outside for example. I stopped latuda and went back to feeling normal. I thought it might have just been me and my bipolar was starting to have a severe effect on my life again so just a few months ago I decided to try latuda again. And within a week I was starting to feel overwhelmed and delusional again. I will never take it again. While the medication was effective, the side effects were horrific.""",6
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on Latuda for about 6 weeks for Bipolar depression. It is one of the most effective medications that I have taken for depression but I&#039;m dealing with a few side effects that I hope will go away. I have the paradox of extreme tiredness followed by difficulty sleeping. If I take it during the day I will have a few hours of fighting falling asleep. When I take it at night (which is what I do now) after the initial sleepiness wears off I wake up several times and am somewhat restless. Hopefully I will be able to adjust better over time. If you need something that works fast for depression I would recommend.""",6
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I started taking this medication about four months ago combined with minocycline for my hormonal cystic acne. The first month I saw no improvement in my skin and abnormally lost 5 pounds. Now three months later my skin is finally completely clear but I&#039;m facing a new problem: the medicine has caused me to gain 10 pounds in my thighs, butt, tummy, and breasts and has given me a yeast infection that has been on and off (mainly on) for the last four months.""",4
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I started on Phentermine on June 7, 2016 at a weight of 235#. I am 5 feet 7.5 inches tall. The only side effects I have experienced are a dry mouth and increased energy (a good thing).  In the first three weeks I lost 15 pounds. Then the weight loss slowed a little. It took three weeks to lose the next ten pounds. My target weight is 180#, a loss of 55#, so I am about half way there. My plan is to take 90 days of Phentermine, then discontinue for 90 days to figure out how to sustain the weight loss without the help of an appetite suppressant. After 90 days I will resume taking Phentermine until I reach my target weight. I have never felt more optimistic about losing weight and keeping it off.""",2
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I have chronic idiopathic pancreatitis, allodynia, gastroparesis &amp; tarsal tunnel syndrome. I was also, just recently tested for Lupus. I was taking Norco (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) for a year until my new doc realized it was making my GI issues worse. We switched to Nucynta ER 150mg/BID &amp; Nucynta IR 75mg for breakthrough. While they worked the first few months, I seem to be building a tolerance. I feel like the ER takes the edge off when my pain is between 4-5. But, both IR &amp; ER cause EXCESSIVE sweating. I mean, there are days I have to change clothes multiple times daily. It&#039;s embarrassing. But, the Nucynta does not have any of the GI side effects (constipation namely) that other narcotics do.""",9
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""Was prescribed Geodon for mania in Bipolar.  Cannot recommend this drug.  I tried to go back to work after being in the hospital for 2 weeks.  Often, I would fall asleep even while typing or working.  This made other activities dangerous and I quickly met with doctor to stop taking this.  I can see this as being a short term fix to mania, but ongoing use of this drug is dangerous.  It could make you have an accident or worse if driving.""",6
Xulane,Birth Control,"""I was only on the patch for a month. I thought it would be a miracle because I began to struggle to remember to take a daily pill. I came to this website, read reviews, decided I&#039;d still try it. Wish I hadnt.

I had insane mood swings and did not feel like myself at all. I was extremely emotional, unreasonable. I felt angry and depressed all of the time. I&#039;d been on the pill for 8 years with no problem, except remember to take it due to a schedule change. The patch was a different story.

I completed my 3 weeks of patch, 1 week for bleeding and promptly got back on the pill. My concern now is, I&#039;m almost a week later starting and I&#039;m normally like clock work. I&#039;ve never been late in my life. Apparently this is common after the patch.""",8
Bupropion,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been annoyed all the time since I can remember. Always a pessimist. I figured if I expected the worst possible scenario anything better was a win.
It was as if I was at war with the world, everything was a battle. Been on Welbutrin for 6 weeks now, 300mg a day in 2 doses to start.
Gave me ridiculously bad headaches (I suffer from migraines already) but my mood, interest, and general sense of well being were better. Doc changed me from 2 doses to 3 doses a day (still 300 mg). No more headaches but slight insomnia so far. 3-4 hours a night now, usually get 6-7 hours of sleep.
And I have the dry mouth as well. I will deal with the insomnia and cotton mouth. To me this is worth it.""",6
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on Claravis for one month. I noticed a smoother complexion within a few days! I had moderate acne starting around 13 years old, I&#039;m 25 now. I consider myself an attractive girl but not without make up. This is the first time in 12 years I have looked in the mirror and thought I looked pretty without make up. It&#039;s a great feeling! I can see my pores getting smaller and my blackhead disappearing more and more everyday. I&#039;m only experiencing 2 side effects, dry lips and a little nauseous anxiety. I have a doctors appointment today to discuss my side effects. I hope they are normal and don&#039;t get worse. I love Claravis.""",4
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I took the strongest available dosage, so I felt the the effects right away. I only ever had one side effect, and that was insomnia. I would wake up every night at 2am and not sleep any longer. However this went away after 3-4 weeks. Cymbalta works well to eliminate depression, however you shouldn&#039;t drink while on it. The only other negative about this medicine is getting off it. Do not, under any circumstances stop taking it immediately. It swings you into an extreme depression. So if and when you stop, try cutting the pill in half for a while to lower the dosage and ease yourself off.""",5
Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""I was on the depo recently. Switched to the pill and after month 3 just wanted to throw up every morning. Remember having these side effects when younger. So.  
Had a break and jumped to Evra! Can say this is the last and final switch!
Three weeks in so far so good. Just boobs have shot up a size. Nipples sensitive to touch. Hurts to lay on front. But can&#039;t complain looks like I&#039;ve had a boob job and I know it&#039;s temporary. No morning sickness. Not hot flushes (pill gave me). No anxiety of some kind that always managed to rear its head. More motivated. No spots. It&#039;s a slow release so I believe as it&#039;s not going through blood stream it is necessarily better for you. Definitely recommend if you&#039;re out of contraceptive ideas due to above side/e""",8
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I am 31 and have had acne for my whole adult life. Frustrated, I went to the dermatologist and she prescribed Doxycycline twice daily with a night time cream (Tetrinoin). You MUST take this medicine with food or else you will feel extremely nauseous. You can&#039;t take it with dairy or within 2 hours of a multi-vitamin. It has been about a month and I have noticed improvement in my skin, although maybe not as much as I would have hoped for.""",4
Loestrin 24 Fe,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on this birth control for 5 weeks now, I was given 3 free months worth to try from my doctor. I take very good care of my skin and I was used to having acne just before a period with my oily combo skin. After the third week of taking this my skin has turned abosolutely horrible! Cystic acne which I&#039;ve never ever had in my life and I&#039;m in my mid 20&#039;s. My entire forehead and cheeks is covered in acne and even spreading to my chest, I&#039;m so upset with this birth control I do not reccommend! I will be going to my doctors tomorrow to switch to TriCyclenLo starting next month. I&#039;m fighting my acne right now with: lush cosmetic warrior mask, 10% benzoyl peroxide medicine, apricot scrub face wash, tea tree oil, and multi vitamins""",4
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""This medicine is a life saver.  I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder in the spring of 2011, and I was on 30mg for a year.  The only side effect I had was lack of sex drive/ability.  Because of this, I weaned off it, and all of my anxiety and panic attacks came back.  I was miserable for about 2 months until I went back on it.  I&#039;ve tried Zoloft, Remeron, and Wellbutrin, but Lexapro is the only one that worked for me.  I had zero panic attacks on Lexapro and enjoyed life.  I am currently back on 10mg and will be moving up to 20mg shortly.

Everyone&#039;s experience differs with these kinds of medicines, but my advice is: stay on it.  The first few weeks might be rough, but as long as the side effects aren&#039;t terrible, give it time.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""Starting taking this 4 years ago. Lost 20 lbs.  It works but if u take it too long you have terrible side effects. Severe dry mouth, bad breath, wired, can&#039;t focus, constipation. I mentioned to the Dr the side effects and he said he&#039;s never had anyone complain about any negative side effects. I also asked if I should only take the medication for a certain period of time and he said no. I guess he got his money so he didn&#039;t care.  I just went off it and have gained about 8lbs back but that&#039;s because you fall hard. You are tired all the time. Like I said it works but I think I will try the eating healthy and exercise.""",3
Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I&#039;m a chronic insomniac and have tried just about every medicine and remedy available. Lunesta 3mg works the best for me although after 10 days I no longer sleep through the night. I wake up after 3 or 4 hours but I can usually fall back asleep for another 3 hours which is better than not sleeping at all.  The only time I&#039;ve noticed the bad taste is when I cut a pill in half.  Don&#039;t do it!""",0
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Okay so my dermatologist just prescribed this medication for my skin today, however I do not have severe acne. I get breakouts near my menstrual period and thats it but it always leaves behind dark marks. So my biggest concern was having dark marks all over my face. Due to hearing all the complaints on here I will first test out a small area on my face and see how that works out. I suggest this for other people as well so you know what you are getting yourself into plus my graduation is in two weeks and I don&#039;t have time for breakouts that I wouldn&#039;t normally have.""",4
Kyleena,Birth Control,"""I believe I started my Kyleena journey in March. The insertion scared me due to horror stories, but I have a high pain tolerance. It was an extremely uncomfortable insertion. I went back to work right after &amp; was pretty okay. I bled for 2.5 weeks straight after insertion. The night before my ultrasound I felt a dull pain in my lower stomach, but I thought it was in my head. Nope-- my IUD was coming out sideways. I decided to try it one more time. I had the reinsertion 2 weeks ago, I have random sharp uterine pain every so often. May be once a day. I do love that I&#039;m no longer bleeding, but I&#039;m not sure if this switch was right for me though I switched from LoLoestrin for the convenience. I have my second ultrasound in a few weeks.""",8
Paxil,Depression,"""I went on Paxil a year after father died 15 years ago. I was told it was non-addictive and started on a low-mid dosage, 20mg.  It helped and was on it for about 10-12 years.  I just accepted that I needed it.  Everyone is correct about not missing doses - if I missed 2-3 days, I&#039;d get very emotional, cry at drop of a hat, etc. - which I unfortunately took as proof that I needed to stay on it - I didn&#039;t understand it was the withdrawal effects!  Over time, with ups/downs in career, I gradually increased dosages, going to 40 mg/day. In late 2010, after out of work for 2-3 years, I went back to general dr and he prescribed 60mg/day.  Within a couple months, I was in downward spiral. """,5
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""Took 10 mg of Belsomra and I started yeawning within 90 min. I went to bed and had nightmare that I was strangling all my pet birds. I woke up within two hours and felt unsteady, heart was racing and felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin. I felt irritable and nauseated too. Needless to stay I didn&#039;t lay down again and it took 12 hours for all the horrible side effect to go away. Maybe I had an allergic reaction to it, but nevertheless I am NEVER taking this devil&#039;s pill again. Back to the Lorazepam. Wish I could give Belsomra negative rating.""",0
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""My 11 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD inattentive in August 2010 and we tried Concerta 36mg and it did nothing. The pediatrician prescribed Vyvanse 40mg to start, and what a difference! My son can now listen, focus, pay attention, concentrate at home and at school and can better manage his behaviors, thoughts and words. We are very happy with the results. He didn&#039;t lose appetite or weight, and has no side effects thus far. We are more than happy to have found a prescription that works for him so that he can function normally on a day to day basis.""",1
Dapsone,Acne,"""I went back to my dermatologist because of hormonal acne.

I currently was only using clear and clear benzoyl peroxide (5%) and aveno moisturizer (with .5% salicylic acid). I have a lot of under the skin deep rooted pimples under my chin that have been here for over 3 years. The dermatologist I went to said the aczone would help with my deep rooted hormonal acne. He told me to apply a small pea size amount over my entire face. He took me off my clean and clear face wash which was actually keeping my acne at bay... I honestly am so disgusted by Aczone. It made me break out into huge pimples on the side of my face where I never had pimples before - EVER. I am still breaking out on the sides of my face! Was on this product for 4 months...!""",4
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""had good skin until 20 years old, college had me stressed so I started getting hormonal acne on my cheeks esp my jaw. I was absolutely devastated, I would cry when I looked at my face in the mirror. I tried everything, just like everybody else here nothing worked. I never wrote a review before, but this medication gave me my life back. My skin starting clearing up immediately, like 2 weeks. 40mg 2 months then 60mg. After my 3rd month my face is 100% clear, don&#039;t get a single pimple even if I sleep in my makeup. Only side effect I have is the most chapped lips are ever but i&#039;ll take it. I wanna run up to every person I see in the street with acne on their face and recommend this medication. if acne is ruining your life please try this.""",4
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""I have been on Brintellix for 8 months. It has been life changing for me. I feel it literally saved my life. I have been on more medicines than I can count over the past 15 yrs. I did have nausea pretty bad for the first couple weeks on Brintellix but taking the medicine at night with crackers and Sprite it was much better after about 2 weeks. Now here is the hopeless part... I have to go off the medicine due to severe side effects that I do not see others reporting. About 6 months into taking Brintellix (4 months on 10 mg and 5 months on 20 mg)I got severely sick with unexplainable internal bleeding and severe gastro problems.Thousands of dollars on medical testing and nothing found.2 days off better but mental disaster.terrible withdrawal""",5
Monodox,Acne,"""I have been taking Monodox now for about a month. It does help a lot with pimples but I still get cystic acne. I have been getting extremely nauseous every time I take it, and that seems to be getting worse the longer I&#039;ve been on the medication. I do take it with food and that doesn&#039;t seem to help. My doctor told me to take both at the same time but I was wondering if taking only one at a time would that reduce the nausea or just make me feel that way twice. I do like the medication but my nausea is debilitating for almost half an hour which isn&#039;t helpful in my work day at all.""",4
Symbyax,Bipolar Disorde,"""After years of feeling as though I were slowly losing my mind to ruminations, agitation, depression, lack of focus and general brain-cooties, it finally dawned on me that I was bipolar and I sought treatment. You may read the other positive reviews on here and think they could be written by manufacturers, but you may be underestimating the efficacy of this medication, it is truly amazing. I feel like I did when I was a younger man, before mental illness took hold in my life. My mind is unencumbered and clear. I feel normal! I still can get sad, I still get annoyed by things, I still feel enthusiasm, but it&#039;s tempered, appropriate emotion. Symbyax is great. Try it. Minimal weight gain, by the way.""",6
Fetzima,Depression,"""This works better than anything I&#039;ve tried. I was doing well with Strattera for 4 years then it stopped working. I did well on Wellbutrin many years, it stopped working, etc. With Fetzima I get up easily in the morning because I lay in bed for at least 15 minutes, I pet and play with my cat, have quiet time saying things I&#039;m grateful for and sometimes I get guidance for information for my day. I don&#039;t overeat anymore, I get full fast, can only eat 1/2 as much as I used to because I get bloated which helps. My headaches went away after 2 months and my sweating is almost gone away now after 3 months. I feel good and motivated to do things. I&#039;m not hyper like with Wellbutrin.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;m 24, 5&#039;6, 167 lbs. I started taking phentermine 37.5mg at 8am and phendimetrazine 35mg at noon everyday in December 08. By March 09, 4 months later, I had lost 30 lbs- from 165-135lbs. Yes it was great, but I had 2 take a break from it. After 15 weeks I was experiencing heart palpitations (cardio workouts were challenging) severe dry mouth (to the point where the inside of my mouth was raw and bleeding) Keep hydrated! Just water will not work! This drug makes you urinate frequently. You need to replace lost electrolytes, use Gatorade. You must do weights, lunges etc because no exercise will result in the fat turning 2 flab. Hallucinations started as well. I was very energetic and insomnia set in. """,3
Tramadol,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed Tramadol 50 mg for headaches and TMJ pain.  However, the biggest difference this medication has made for me is the way it has helped my anxiety and depression.  It is truly amazing, and a blessing.  I have severe social anxiety but I find now that I can talk to people and actually want to socialize.  No other med has really ever helped me.  I truly wish that doctors understood how this medication helps those of us with long-standing anxiety and depression, it&#039;s a miracle.""",7
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""I was quick to anger, severe mood swings would yell at my kids for the slightest things. I was ready to punch anybody that would make me mad and( it didn&#039;t take much!) I started with Cymbalta 30mg and I noticed a slight difference I was increased to 60 mg and I felt the change right away. I&#039;m so calm and I&#039;m back to being a happy mom. I take it at night because it would get me sleepy during the day if I take in the morning some of the side effects I&#039;ve experienced have been dry mouth, lack of appetite, hot flashes, tiredness! I love this medicine it has changed my life. The relationship with my children is much much better too. I no longer have crying spells and I&#039;m a much nicer person. Try Cymbalta.""",7
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""Have been on Geodon for a little over 2 months &amp; I LOVE IT! It is definitely a life saver! It helps with my depression and mood swings. I take 40mg at night it helps me sleep &amp; feel refreshed in the morning. I even started back college for Nursing. Helps me make good choices and makes me a lot more positive and energetic! I started off at 120mg at night but left me groggy &amp; drowsy the next day until it was time for me to take it again at night so I dropped down to 40mg &amp; it works wonders! I agree that every medicine isn&#039;t for everybody but definitely give it a try.""",6
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""This is my first time ever trying adipex.

Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I was on Skyla for 8-9 months. Insertion was painful but the cramping subsided within a day or so. Skyla is advertised to reduce the frequency of your periods but mine actually became more frequent (every 3 weeks) and lasted longer(8-9 days) than when I was on the pill (3-5 days). Also, it caused my skin to become very oily and I developed cystic acne. I never had an issue with acne until I started Skyla. The only benefit I saw was not having to take a pill every day. After having Skyla removed and going back to my BC pill, my skin and periods went back to normal within 4-6 weeks. Removal wasn&#039;t nearly as painful as insertion. I&#039;m very bummed Skyla didn&#039;t work for me--I was so ready to be done taking a pill every day.""",8
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""At first I loved it. I&#039;m going on year two now. But recently I have slipped two months of a period and have fallen into a so far sixteen day light blood with clots period. I was diagnosed with extreme anxiety not too long after receiving and I feel like the mood swings and problems brought on from the hormones is causing a problem in my six yr marriage and sex life. I&#039;m 27 with  two boys. I shouldn&#039;t be feeling this achy and psycho. As far as weight gain goes.....ive lost a ton of weight on it 40lbs slow and healthily. I feel the weight gain has a lot to do with diet and activity""",8
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I have been on Effexor XR for 17 years now. I take 150mg once a day. My biggest negative side effect is extreme, excessive  sweating. I tried going off it earlier this year because I was fed up with this issue and thinking that maybe I really didn&#039;t need  it any longer. Bad mistake. Within 2 month&#039;s I was back at my Doctors a mental mess and was put back on it. I guess you have to take the good with the bad. Does anyone else have a issue like this while taking this med? It can be very embarrassing and makes me very self conscious.""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started phen on 4\22\2015 with a starting weight of 226, I am a 5&#039;8  female with PCOS  trying to loose weight  for health and personal issues. As of 4\28\2015 my weight is  now 214. Honestly I am not sure if it&#039;s the pills doing or the combination of eating better,(totally cutting out carbs ,sugars) and exercising 3 days to 1 day off. But it&#039;s working and I&#039;m happy with the results The only thing I have noticed is dry mouth and heart palpitations. But I notice when I work out after taking the pill I don&#039;t notice them.  I have been experiencing  hunger pains as well.  I&#039;m only on the 15mg dose so maybe that&#039;s why it doesn&#039;t curb my appetite  like it&#039;s supposed to. Overall I&#039;m pleased and will continue to loose weight. End goal, 140""",3
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""I had a great experience with this antidepressant. I am 18 and I&#039;ve been on it for four years. I forgot to take it today for the first time in years. I&#039;ve been crying and shaking all day because my body doesn&#039;t know how to function without it. Needless to say, I need it to get through every day life. It&#039;s worked so well for so long. I can&#039;t see myself getting off of it any time soon.""",5
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""If I could give this a 0 I would. I had this for 7 mths and for the 7 mths, i bleed the who time except maybe 4 to 5 days out of the 7 mths. they put me on the pill to thinking that it would stop the bleeding but it did not. I ended up getting it out and when they took it out it took them 2 and a half hours to take it out because it was difficult to find and it was rapped around the tendons in my arm. After getting it taken out my whole arm was bruised for 2 months after that and I had regular periods.""",8
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""21, no kids, had Paragard inserted yesterday. I read hundreds of reviews beforehand that led me to believe I&#039;d be writhing in pain the whole time. Yes, it hurt, but only for 20 seconds total out of a 5 minute ordeal. I think for me at least, a lot of what I was registering as pain was more shock at such a completely foreign sensation. I immediately had what felt like my usual, period cramps but a bit worse, but those went away after 5ish hrs. Now, less than 24 hrs after insertion, I feel FINE. Every so often I&#039;ll get a dull cramp but that&#039;s IT. Here&#039;s hoping it continues to be a positive experience (for the next TEN years!!!?!)""",8
Phentermine,Obesity,"""I haven&#039;t wrote a review on here in a while but really want others to share because it helps me keep going. So I began in May 2015 at 275 my highest weight ever, I am now at 220 according to my scale at home which usually is a little over my docs scale. I have taken a total of 5 month doses in these 8 months because I don&#039;t want to purely depend on the pills. But they are amazing I get crazy cravings and loose motivation easily these help so much. I would like to loose another 40lbs to help me keep it off I plan on using b-12 shots that I also love.""",2
Actiq,Pain,"""I have horrible nerve pain. Neither vicodin, oxycontin, morphine or any other opium based medicine worked. Plus my body had gotten used to the other pain pills. The actiq was AMAZING! It almost completely rid me of the pain (1000x stronger than morphine) and it is measured in micrograms (Mcg)it is so powerful. It was perfect for my burning nerve pain, and nerve spasms. Easiest drug to get BOTH chemically AND mentally addicted. Be careful""",9
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""PTSD. Seemed to help some. Have bit of dizzy loopy for about 15 to 30 minutes after taking then ok. Was taking other meds and got sick and barfed often. Quit taking and nausea stopped. After a couple of months feeling quite anxious so started up Buspar again and anxiety seems to be very much calmed down. I plan to space meds out throughout day and find a schedule where my tummy doesn&#039;t feel so nauseated.""",7
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""Lexpro is the best medication. I had no life befor Lexpro. I used to suffer for 8 years from anxiety and panick attacks. I was always scared from anything. The doctor asked me to try Lexpro I was so afriad of medications, I thought medications would never help me. I used think that I will help my self to stop thinking about it. I thought they were all thoughts in my mind and I have to change them I used to get panick attacks everday when I&#039;m sleeping. I would recommend anyone to try this medication because this medication will safe your life if you have anxity I have been 10 mg for months then 15 for 2 months and 4 months for 20 Mg and am still taking it. And I will never stop taking it""",7
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""Back pain 7 yrs ... Spinal Stenosis and Degenerative Disc ... Once I was prescribed Opana ER I was also prescribed a companion breakthrough medicine taken 4 x daily, these have been rotated every few mos. Dr. started Opana 10 ER 2 x daily, then Opana ER 20 twice daily. I&#039;m now on Opana ER 40mg twice daily.

I&#039;m seldom pain free but with Opana ER 40 and a breakthrough medicine I&#039;m more comfortable.  I can now stand and do tasks for short periods, then sit until the pain subsides.  This method has allowed me to cook, do laundry, raise tomatoes, etc.  I know that sounds limited but before I was pretty much chair bound.  NOW FEEL I HAVE MY LIFE BACK.

SEVERE CONSTIPATION only reaction but I&#039;ve had that with every pain medicine prescription.""",9
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had Skyla placed about 4 months ago. I have had a child naturally before, so that may have come into play for my placement. I came into the doctor&#039;s office while on my period, and the experience was uneventful. One uncomfortable pinch that lasted less than a second, and I was done. It probably helped that I was joking with the assistant the whole time, vs focusing on any pain. I didn&#039;t take any advil or anything, and after my appointment I went and got tattooed for 3 hours.  I have experienced longer spotting at the ends of my periods (usually a 4 day period, followed by a week or so of spotting). It&#039;s annoying, but I have zero other side effects, so I like it. Hubby can occasionally feel it, but overall we like it.""",8
Belviq,Obesity,"""Started the end of February.  First day was a little woozy so  next day I just did half dose.  Third day tried whole dose again and was just fine.  March I started counting calories with Fitness Pal.  May 1st I began my Whole30 program which I definitely recommend to everyone.  To date June 24 I&#039;ve lost 45 pounds.  Belviq is great.  Highly recommend.  What it has done for me is allow me to focus on what, when and why I&#039;m eating.  It gives you the power to master your food decisions.  Tip:  if your insurance doesn&#039;t cover it, go to the Belviq website and get their card that makes it $75 a month to buy this prescription.""",2
Spironolactone,Acne,"""Spironolactone has been a miracle drug for me. I&#039;ve suffered from acne since the age of 11. I&#039;ve tried every pill and cream that my parents could afford. Nothing has ever fully worked because my acne is hormone related. If it did help, my face would be red, peel, and break out again once I discontinued the product. A friend introduced me to spironolactone and my life has never been the same. It took a good 4 months for me to see even a slight difference. But 1.5 years later my face is clear and has been ever since. I would highly recommend spironolactone. Just be patient for the first 3-4 months, but you will see results.""",4
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""My 10 yr old daughter was put on low dose (20mg) of Vyvanse for ADHD.  Her ADHD was severely affecting her school work.  Positive:  immediately teachers and I noticed she could focus, sit more still, and initiate her own homework, etc...  But it&#039;s the NEGATIVE side affects that seriously concerned me.  She went from a cheerful, joyous girl, to a melancholy zombie.  Even worse, she became more and more depressed &amp; irritable at night.  She said she felt like she lost all personality and had a sadness that she didn&#039;t understand why.  I can not emphasize enough how scary it was to see her whole personality change, and that was not worth any benefits.she got out of Vyvanse. Other side effects:  loss of appetite, joint/muscle pain, mouth twitch.""",1
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 22, no kids and I just got the Skyla inserted yesterday 2/4/16. I read all these horror stories online and made myself extremely nervous! The whole experience took about 15min from signing in to waiting my turn to the actual insertion to walking out the door. The insertion was very painful but lasted only 30secs! I cramped all day after but nothing ibufrofen couldn&#039;t help. I spotted for a few hours. Used a heating pad to help with the cramps. I switched to skyla from depo and I&#039;m hoping I made the right choice. Only on day two so I will update when I got back for my follow up.""",8
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I am 25 and I have been on Depo-Provera for about 3 years. My mother is my doctor so she warned me about the weight gain. I somehow lost 5lbs once I started taking it. My weight has been up and down for the past 2 years but I don&#039;t think it is due to the shot. Its my love of food. Anyways, the shot is great; every 3 months. I haven&#039;t had a period for 3 years. Spotting every now and then but that&#039;s okay. I am very worried about getting off of the shot but I will prepare for that when the time comes.""",8
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I had my 3rd child last yr and wanted effective contraception i didn&#039;t have to think about. I thought it was so great I recommended it to my sisters. I was very concerned about putting on weight after my third child so definitely asked my doctor if it was a concern my mirena, and she definitely said the  risk was minimal. One year on, and i have put on at least 13 kilos after my pregnancy!!!! I also feel quite depressed and emotional. After checking in with my two sisters who had also got miren we realised wed All gained weight since getting the iud. Not happy!""",8
Venlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve had depression, dissociation, mild OCD, &amp; bad anxiety my entire life. After I found out my ex GF was triggering my dissociation to have odd sexual fantasies with me, my dis grew into dissociative identity disorder &amp; my mild OCD grew into a terrible 3 type OCD. Cleaning, Counting, &amp; Pure O. My dr prescribed me 1 Venlafaxine 150xr/day. Within a month, my 2 alts were gone, my anxiety was far less (almost non existent), my OCD was gone, and my depression was way less. When I go more than 2 days without my Ven, I get brain zaps &amp; terrible anger. I have to hide away. It&#039;s masking my issues but I want to fix them. I also get night sweats and have trouble waking up. Both started when I started taking Ven. I don&#039;t recommend these. Avoid SNRIs!""",7
Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""I have been on the patch for 10 months now and I absolutely love it. I don&#039;t worry about pregnant scares at all. The only down side I have is that when I put on a new patch after my period I get really nauseated and a bad headache for a few hours but this started about 3 months ago and the other downside is that when I exercise and take hot showers it seems to make the patch slip off. But it&#039;s honestly the best birth control I&#039;ve been on EASY to use and GREAT protection.""",8
Wellbutrin SR,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on Wellbutrin for 2 weeks and I don&#039;t really feel any better. I notice weight gain and more irritability than usual. I&#039;ve read that I must be patient and continue taking it and I should see improvement after about a month. I took this years ago and it was the reason I was able to quit smoking. My wife called it the happy pill because she saw a big difference in my mood. So far it&#039;s not having the same affect it did 15 yrs ago. I do like that I am not having any other side affects. My sex drive is still good and I think my anxiety  has improved somewhat. I&#039;m on 100 mg a day and I take it first thing in the morning.""",5
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""Has significantly reduced my mania and irritability.  I&#039;m much more stable.  Has also reduced my need for alcohol, which I used frequently to medicate.  I&#039;ve been on several medicines for bipolar and this one seems to work for me. Started at 2mg. at night and worked up to 10mg, (5th day at 10mg.) and feel much more in control.  My insomnia is gone too. I haven&#039;t gained any weight but was on Risperdal (gained 10 pds.) can&#039;t seem to lose that weight. Since I&#039;ve decided to quit drinking maybe I&#039;ll lose the weight.""",6
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on Latuda, for 23 days for my post traumatic stress disorder, manic attacks, etc.  At first it seemed to be working.  By day 19, I began having uncontrollable muscle shaking. The last day I took it, my throat started closing up. My tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth.  Luckily, I had some Xanax.  Otherwise I&#039;d been in the ER. I couldn&#039;t sleep, think clearly, or simply sit still. I&#039;m sure for some people this medication is helpful.  It scared me, cause I was having problems swallowing, and breathing.""",6
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve had no good results using Qsymia.  I shutter at the cost too...$4.66 per day and that is using their &quot;savings card!&quot;  I could spend that much on shakes and lose weight.  I lost a pound in a month.  It does nothing to control my cravings at night, and yes, I eat right, am on my feet a lot, take my dog out on daily walks, so I&#039;m not just sitting around hoping it&#039;ll take off the weight.
    It didn&#039;t work in the first month so I&#039;m not going to spend another days pay to give it another chance.  Hopefully it will work for you.""",3
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m a 21 year old female and just diagnosed with Bipolar I. It&#039;s been a roller coaster ride especially after gaining 10 pounds in the hospital while taking risperidone and Depakote. I&#039;m still on the Depakote, though I hope to discontinue it as soon as my psychiatrist allows, but I just switched to Abilify. I&#039;ve got to say, so far I have no complaints. With risperidone I had no &quot;lid&quot; to my hunger. It was endless, and that was quite disappointing. There were many other side effects, but the weight gain has added to my self loathing. Though the painful heart dysrhythmias are a close second. I&#039;m hoping that Abilify makes it possible for me to curb my appetite back to what it used to be as I exercise the 30 pounds I don&#039;t need away.""",6
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""My MD prescribed me this drug for weight loss. I&#039;m a 42 year old female who has struggled with weight all of my life, and I&#039;m starting to have all of the health issues that are going with it. I am on my 3rd week of Victoza and I&#039;m at 1.8 dosage. I&#039;ve had some severe nausea this week, and last week burps (the rotten egg kind) but that has been mostly it. I&#039;m not sure how much weight I&#039;ve lost, but I can tell I&#039;m losing it quickly. I simply don&#039;t want to eat. I have to force myself to eat, and when I do, my calorie intake is often times less than 1,000 calories a day. I hope the side effects settle down.""",2
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""Have never experienced such a high quality of sleep since 8 years, was very promising.
Experienced night sweats and vivid dreams at the beginning . But I didn&#039;t mind at all because I thought finally I can stop taking benzos and go with this healthier alternative.
After the 3rd day and increasing with each day, my preexisting stuttering condition worsened significantly and I began to experience severe anxiety and felt dizzy during the day. My doctor saw me during treatment and a week after stopping and was shocked at how much my stuttering decreased and anxiety reduction.
I am so disappointed it didn&#039;t work for me. I still recommend people try it.""",0
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been in lamictal and Wellbutrin for over 2 years without a lift on severe bipolar depression. It felt like they kept me just from the edge of suicide but in dark misery. 

We started trying atypical antipsychotics...abilify helped a bit with 8 lbs weight gain, saphris lowered anxiety and weight but left depression untouched then came latuda and life changed at 40 mg. The dark cloud lifted in three weeks and I saw and thought and felt clearly. I&#039;m envious that people feel this way all the time and don&#039;t appreciate it all. I&#039;m finally living and not just surviving. 

Small prices to pay are sleepiness and having to eat so much to take the pills, because it knocks me out I eat later than I&#039;d like and have noticed weight gain.""",6
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I originally started this on January 8, 2016 at a weight of 223 lbs. and ended it sometime around August 2016. I started with 15mg and increased to 30mg then decreased to come off of it. I lost over 60 pounds during that time and then lost a little more after coming off of the medication. I maintained my weight with a 5 lb fluctuation. Just recently (Feb. 2017) I was put back on the medication to help me drop weight before possible surgery. I was instantly put on 30mg. I started at 160 lbs and as of today I&#039;m at 145 lbs. The goal is to be at 130-135 lbs. 

I haven&#039;t had any bad side affects other than random bursts of energy, dry mouth, the nasty taste in my mouth, And the lack of bowel movements.""",3
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""After 2 heart surgeries I developed severe anxiety.  I also had constant chest pain that was not cardiac related as well as being afraid to sleep lying flat because I couldn&#039;t breathe.  Before that I was always the calmest person in any situation and suddenly being distracted by irrational fears was devastating for me.  My doctor prescribed Lexapro 20 mg daily which I initially did not take because I didn&#039;t want to be on an SSRI.  After a severe panic attack while on duty, I started taking the medication and experienced complete relief of my anxiety and panic attacks within a week.  I have not experienced any of the side effects except some gas, and my high sex drive has not been affected.""",7
Paxil,Anxiety,"""I first tried Paxil in 2003, after trying everything and I do mean every antidepressant on the market. I couldn&#039;t believe in less than a week I was already feeling relief. My mistake: I kept going on and off of it. It eventually stopped helping. So for 3 years I went on Celexa, which helped less than Paxil but more than others. Recently I began getting severe generalized anxiety dsorder along with my Depression. I finally decided to give the Paxil a try again since so much time had lapsed since I&#039;d been on it. Well...it worked again. Feeling better than I have in a long time. Message: Everybody is different so Paxil won&#039;t work for all. But if it does you..STAY ON IT. Don&#039;t try the on and off thing. Good Luck!""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been on and off this medicine for a year or so and what I&#039;ve found is that when I stay on it and take it like I&#039;m supposed to, I lose weight and eat healthier.  When  go off I eat horribly but it&#039;s honestly more of me going off my diet so I don&#039;t bother with the Contrave.  Now I have been taking it faithfully since February 1st and eating low carb and I&#039;m down over 25 lbs.  I think it does really work and it helps me make better choices.  My main reason for this review is to let all of the &quot;newbies&quot; know that the side effects will go away.  I felt horrible for the first few weeks as I was building up my dosage but I have absolutely no side effects now.  Start very slowly and gradually build up to the full dose""",2
Sertraline,Depression,"""I was prescribed this a couple of months ago for severe anxiety and postpartum depression after an ectopic pregnancy. I felt euphoric for the first few days, and was literally awake for over 48 hours straight. But after the initial side effects wore off I was so thankful for this meditation. I was always against antidepressants and believed I could just &#039;get over it&#039; with my mind...but after losing the baby my anxiety was through the roof and I couldn&#039;t function like a normal person. I&#039;d come home from work and hide in my room away from my family, I avoided leaving the house unless I absolutely had to, I&#039;d spend all day exhausting myself. I now feel more like myself than I have in years.""",5
Copper,Birth Control,"""Getting it is a shot in the dark.

My periods were all over the place (sometimes twice a month, sometimes once every 3 months), excruciating pain on periods, heavy bleeding lasting for 7 days minimum. Twice during that 3 years, I&#039;ve started spotting non stop for 1-2 months. The last straw was a period of constant spotting for 3 months that eventually transformed into bleeding. Today, 4 days after it&#039;s been taken out, I am still bleeding as much, and I became anemic. The constant wearing of pads has irritated my vagina. Sex is not even part of my life anymore, I just feel disgusting all the time... Kind of ironic when you think I got it as a birth control. 

But hey, at least it didn&#039;t get lodged, so I&#039;ll give it 2 stars.""",8
Avinza,Pain,"""The medication was far superior and hopefully safer than using Percocet. The issue is continuous relief for several torn/ruptured discs. Surgical intervention is not guaranteed to resolve my problem. Pain level is 5-6 continuous and takes over your life. So what to do. Many personal issues to consider but in the end I realized that until a solution if found I don&#039;t have a lot of options here. Went to a shrink and others and finally accepted status at this time. Never drink, take as directed, and trust yourself. Never, never, fall into the trap of changing the dosing from the prescribed format.""",9
Diclofenac,Pain,"""I was prescribed Voltaren Gel (didn&#039;t know it came in pill form as well) for a fractured arm that had been misdiagnosed and left untreated for 3 weeks , it helped with that pain so  I tried it on my knees  it reduced the swelling. They look like knees again I can bend them and I don&#039;t notice have the constant pain. I have 3 degenerated disc in my lower back it doesn&#039;t seem to help with that""",9
Aczone,Acne,"""I struggled with acne since beginning middle school.  all other topical medications were too harsh and either irritated my skin to where it was red and over oily, or it made my acne worse.  Yes its normal to get worse before getting better, but after months of the other medicines it never got better.  While using aczone, my acne never got worse, only better after the first few days.  I have been using it for about 4 months now and my skin is completely smooth besides the occasional pimple that is barely there.  All i have left to take care of are the scars that were left over the years.  strongly recommend aczone to all with sensitive skin!""",4
Clonidine,ADHD,"""My 8-year old son has been on various stimulants, in addition to regular clonidine, Intuniv, Risperdal, Seroquel, Strattera and Abilify.

My son is extremely impulsive and aggressive to our family on a daily basis, and I had been thinking that nothing would help our son. Our new psychiatrist recommended Kapvay and we were very skeptical, as our son was irritable and even more aggressive regular clonidine with Kapvay, there has been a SIGNIFICANT decrease in our son&#039;s aggressiveness.  He is still very obsessive, rude and defiant verbally.  So physically, we rate Kapvay a TEN in decreasing aggression.  But only rated it a seven due to other factors.  It is the ONLY medicine that has helped physical aggression for our son.""",1
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""My sister-in-law has been on it for 6 months and I cannot believe how much weight she has lost.  However, she has to work really hard at it and exercises like the energizer bunny, and has changed her eating. However, she seems to still have her glasses of wine and still keeps off the weight. Today is my first day using the pill and already I didn&#039;t realize it was 1:00pm already, and hadn&#039;t wanted lunch. I want to lose about 20 lbs, but at a stand still at the moment.  Diet and exercise was not working. I will report back in a month with hopefully great results.""",3
Spironolactone,Acne,"""I&#039;m only a few weeks into taking this medication and have already experienced great results. I had great skin until I was 21, I started getting severe hormonal acne on my face and back. I currently take spironolactone and epiduo, the combination is working great. I have experienced the medications side effects of having to use the restroom frequently and being dizzy if I get up too fast. To me, the side effects are very livable and easy to adapt to. I think it is important to note the severity of not getting pregnant while on this medication. I was warned that this medication can cause a deformity in male genitalia if you conceive while on this medicine. Always check with your doctor first.""",4
Yasmin,Acne,"""I started on Brenda and it made my mild acne worse. I switched to Yasmin and it cleared it right up, however, 5 months on and my face has started feeling greasy and I&#039;m developing small pimples. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just this hot dry weather. 
Ps: I stopped doing a 4 step cleansing and treating routine as I thought I had no need. So perhaps it&#039;s a combination of those two factors.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started using Adipex on March 31.  Today is April 2nd.  I used to drink at LEAST 2 cups of coffee a day.  I haven&#039;t thought about or needed coffee at all since I&#039;ve been taking Adipex. I was a chronic pusher-of-the-snooze-button 20 times every morning.  Now, I wake up feeling refreshed and energized.  The dry mouth?  I personally think it&#039;s the best part.  I&#039;m drinking a liter of water a day.  I don&#039;t think I drank a liter of water the entire year of 2008.  I haven&#039;t weighed myself yet. I&#039;m trying to hold off as long as possible but I can say that my face has gotten a lot thinner.  So if I haven&#039;t lost any weight I know its coming.""",3
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I have degenerative disc disease and recently blew a disc in my neck which was excruciating.  I&#039;ve dealt with lower back disc related issues for 30 years, but this pain in my neck left shoulder and arm was beyond anything I could cope with. I wasn&#039;t sleeping and functioning was near impossible.  The doctors tried me on Lyrica which was bad for me, then Cymbalta which made me lose a lot of hair and extreme muscle cramps (not to mention the really bad withdrawals), but just a week into taking 200mg of gabapentin before bed I am virtually pain free!  I&#039;ve gained a little weight, but that&#039;s about it.  My fingers and hands are still tingling but the pain associated is almost gone and most definitely tolerable.

I LOVE this stuff so far.""",9
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""It has been about a week and half since I started Abilify. It has been 50 years of suffering Clinical Depression. I have been without Depression ever since I started Abilify. I am one happy camper! I have been so resistant to so many medicines. Have been on Lexapro, Welbutrin and Trazodone for years. The past year(s) I had this depression that was &quot;hovering&quot; over me preventing me to feel any enjoyment whatsoever. Well, Abilify has allowed me to feel LIFE. I have energy and I even look forward doing things again. The only negative factor is that I enjoy my one cup of coffee a day. Well, no more. If I drink a cup, I feel as if I drank tons of coffee. Stay away from Caffeine. And, I am NOT HUNGRY!""",5
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I am new to the anxiety realm, and have already tried a few different meds (xanax, ativan, buspar) and so far buspar has shown the most promise. However, even on buspar I still experience sporadic chest pressure, sharp pains in the chest, brain buzz, and muscle twitches. Today the chest issues were so bad that I had to take a xanax.

I am typically against prescribed meds, and this is really the first time in my life taking them. The side effects and other dangers scare the crap out of me, but I need to figure out how to subdue my anxiety.

Does anyone have any suggestions?""",7
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""Dad always had some amount of general anxiety but managed it reasonably.  In approx 1982 he was prescribed Xanax after his Dad died unexpectedly and he was instructed to take X as needed.  He&#039;s been on and off X ever since then and has needed progressively more.  About 20 years ago he &quot;graduated&quot; to other medications including anti-depressants and at one point was on a combo that resulted in a nearly-successful suicide attempt.  He never had suicidal thoughts before or after that particular combo.  He&#039;s now old and his life is in ruins.  He takes X throughout the day but is at the max and cannot take more.  Please be aware once you start on these medications you&#039;re in it for life.  Dr&#039;s know this -- job security for them!""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I was on this med for a little over a week. Right off it made me feel great everything was good. And I really liked it and I was happy I found something that worked. But after a week it started to make me really really  hungry I could not get rid of the hunger. So I had to stop taking it. I have a hard time to find a med. that works. I had the genetic tests done and there is a lot of meds I can&#039;t take. So it is hard to find one that works. I have ADHD and there is not much meds I can take. Vyvanse was a  question but it worked well just made me hungry. I wished it did not make me hungry. Now I hope my Doctor puts me on another ADHD med.""",1
Adderall,ADHD,"""Adderall has been a blessing to me. I take 30mg twice a day and my thinking has become so much more clear. I am now able to pay attention and absorb what is going on around me. I have had no negative side effects except for an occasional night where it might take me an extra 30 minutes to fall asleep. I still have a healthy appetite since taking Adderall. This medicine has made my life so much better.""",1
Victoza,Weight Loss,"""I started Victoza exactly 4 weeks ago. I have felt nauseous from time to time but generally feel worse if I eat more than I needed. I can easily feel very full eating 700-800 calories a day. I haven&#039;t had any other side effects except that I have way more energy than before which is wonderful for someone who has fibromyalgia and is always tired!!  The inches are melting away and I&#039;m so happy to have lost 11.5lbs, it&#039;s amazing!  After unexplained weight gain of 77lbs over the course of a year this is just what I needed. 1 month in and 1/6 of the weight I need to lose has already gone - if you haven&#039;t already, give it a go.""",3
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I have now lost 13 pounds on Belviq in one month! My start weight was 186lbs and now I am 173lbs. I continue to eat normally with no side effects. It is so much fun to be able to control my eating instead of my eating controlling me. I spent a solid year on a low carb diet and only lost 25 lbs until I quit losing and started gaining it back. I was very motivated during that year to lose weight and followed the low carb diet. I know Belviq says use with motivated clients but I can assure you I was only slightly motivated...I wanted a miracle pill. Belviq is that.""",3
Lyrica,Pain,"""For the past 3 years I have been dealing with nerve pain left from shingles in my neck. I have tried EVERYTHING for this pain including injections and narcotics. Nothing really helped unless I was a zombie. I am allergic to a lot of medications including Tegretol and Neurontin. So when my neurologist suggested I try this medication I was VERY skeptical. I have been on this medicaton for a week now. I started on 25mg twice a day and felt some relief. I thought it was in my head. Now I am on 50mg twice a day and I can&#039;t believe the difference. I am relieved I can finally get my life back. I am a mother of 2. I did not realize how much the pain had taken over my life until now.""",9
Dilaudid,Pain,"""Was prescribed 2 mg tablets to be taken 1 or 2 pills every 3 or 4 hours after my complicated rotator cuff surgery which involved reattaching three completely torn through tendons. The pills were completely ineffective. They did nothing for my pain. I quit taking them after the first day.  I could not tell that I had taken anything. The circulating ice water machine they send you home from surgery with and regular Advil provided much better relief.""",9
Accutane,Acne,"""I have been on Accutane for only 2 months now and my skin hasn&#039;t looked this good since I was maybe 14 and I am 19 now! I have had only doses of 20mg for the past 2 months but the only side effect I have had is the dry lips and skin. It&#039;s going so great and I highly recommend it to people that are struggling with acne! I struggled real bad this past year (my freshmen year in college) and I tried everything before this. It&#039;s a process, but I noticed results in my first month!""",4
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I started taking 20 mg of Latuda in addition to the 900 mg of Lithium that I&#039;ve been on for over 10 years. Even before the dosage was increased to 40 mg after one week, I noticed a difference in my mood: I became less depressed, wanted to do things like cleaning up, less withdrawn, and the suicidal thoughts disappeared. My sleeping is still not as good as it should be however even with the 25 mg of Seroquel which I sleep very poorly without. I also take Lorazepam as needed for anxiety. I am starting on 80 mg dosage of Latuda shortly, and if all goes well my psych said the Lithium may eventually be dropped.""",6
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien for 2 years now for insomnia and trouble sleeping.  It does make you tired, but you also feel really good and happy.  I would take it and an hour later, not remember anything. Also, I would still wake up every hour. It helped me fall asleep, but not stay asleep.  Recently, I over dosed on Ambien.  That is what really woke me up.  This is not for me.  I have been prescribed Seroquel for my sleeping problems and this is wonderful. I have no more sleepwalking and I remember everything.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking it on March 17th and was weighed in at 178lbs. Since I am only 5 foot tall you would say I was rather large. I just went for my 3 week check up and have lost 8 pounds. The only side effects have been sleeplessness and dry mouth, which in turn was a good thing. Now I drink lots of water and before I didn&#039;t drink any water. This stuff really works. I would recommend it to anyone who has a weight problem.""",3
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I began using Saxenda one month ago today. I am 30 and started at 438 lbs. today I am 414. 24 lbs in one month, I have not changed my diet or began exercising more than I do already (physical labor) 

I can truly say that Saxenda is working great, Nausea is a side effect, some days much more present than others, but it is a side effect so minute in comparison to the fact that I eat less than my wife (110 soaking wet) at meals where I would usually eat all of my food and polish hers off while waiting for desert.

Finally an appetite suppressant I can honestly say is working. 

Month 2; I plan on dieting properly, Not eating sugars/fatty foods...and Month 3 I plan on exercising regularly again.""",2
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""It&#039;s extremely effective as far as not getting pregnant, but those side effects are something else. At first when I first got it it was right after having my son so probably like 2 weeks after my 6 week check up. I bled for at least 2-3 months it was absolutely horrible. Not a light flow either. I&#039;m gaining literally a lot of weight, at first the weight gain isn&#039;t noticeable, but then it just hits you. I haven&#039;t changed my eating habits or anything. Even joined a gym, but that doesn&#039;t seem to help. My depression is at an all time high. Really Moody. And sometimes after I have sex I bleed for literally a week or two. I really don&#039;t recommend it, because of the side effects.""",8
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""I switched to Opana ER this year as the Morphine ER I had been forced to take since last summer made me very nauseated (even w/nausea meds), caused terrible headaches and didn&#039;t cover my pain adequately so I could live some sort of life. 

I have loved the Opana ER.  I take 40 mg twice a day and after the first month in which the switchover was difficult there have only been a few occasions where after I took the drug I started going through withdrawal.  I&#039;m not sure what was wrong with the pills as I set an alarm to take them and confirmed I took them. 

Now am in donut hole. Endo pharm won&#039;t help because there is a generic which costs more than the Opana.  Don&#039;t know what to do.""",9
Sertraline,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking 200mg Zoloft for the past 3 and 1/2 months (started 5 months ago) for (severe) depression and social anxiety disorder as well as other (less severe) conditions. I think this medicine is fairly effective for the long-term, but it was very hard for me to wait for it to &#039;kick in&#039; after several months of taking it. I cannot compare this medication to other antidepressants, but it was pretty good; it was also much more effective (for me).""",5
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I love it. Remember not everything is right for everybody we all have different bodies. I can&#039;t take anything I always have bad side effects I am 3 days in now I noticed I can go without snacking all day and night because for some reason I&#039;m hungry all the time and by the 3rd day I feel different in a good way. I&#039;m going to wait until my 7th day to weigh myself, I just feel more positive or something its hard to explain I guess like I have some hope now. I weigh 206 now I want to be back to my normal weight of 130 and I have a feeling I may be able to do that now since now I can pass on the carbs without craving them all the time. I hope that other people that feel like there is no hope and feel like a prisoner in your body can use this also.""",3
Capsaicin,Pain,"""For years I suffered from plantar fasciitis in my heel.  I could not even walk the pain was so bad.  I would have to hop on one foot to get around.  I tried everything from hot soaks to ibuprofen and new shoes. 
I saw a free sample of lotion with capsaisin in it, .01 % dose.  I had read reviews of all the burning so I had it for month and never tried it.  One day the pain was so bad I gave it a whirl.
Instant relief!  No burning, no stinging, not even a warmth.  I can walk again very comfortably.  I am so glad I learned of this medication.  
I donot understand why so many people experience burning and I did not.... But you should try it.  
Oh and if you live near a dollar store they sell a 7&quot; patch for $1.  I got 6 uses out of $1....""",9
Mirena,Birth Control,"""Other than being effective in preventing pregnancy, the side effects I experienced with the Mirena were not enjoyable. I really liked the idea that it was a local hormone as opposed to a systemic hormone (only puts the hormones into your reproductive organs instead of throughout the entire body which is what the pill did), and the convenience of not having to take a pill every day was the biggest positive! However, due to the hormones being local, I noticed the positive benefits I experience with the pill such as not getting acne, came back. My skin got really bad. Also, I ended up getting my period more frequently, for longer periods, as well as had spotting in between periods for the entire 2 years of having my IUD I got it removed.""",8
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""I have been dealing with major insomnia for the past 2 mths. and, after trying other sleep meds (which didn&#039;t work), was prescribed 1mg of Lunesta before bed. It took about an hour to put me to sleep. I got about 5 disturbed hours of sleep. I tossed and turned all night and woke up feeling like I&#039;d had 1 hr of sleep. Then the bad part came: the morning. I woke up super drowsy, had intense anxiety, OCD, tremors, chest and nasal congestion, stomach upset and shortness of breath. I was also super emotional and cried uncontrollably all day. These symptoms lasted all day. All that, so that I can get basically no sleep on this pill?! Needless to say, I will never take this pill again! The side effects are worse than anything I&#039;ve experienced!""",0
Acanya,Acne,"""Also for the people saying it dries our your skin very badly, you must be using too much. It does dry your skin out but not badly at all. You&#039;re supposed to use very, very little bit of it on your acne. Not your whole face, just your acne. I learned the hard way. I loaded it up on my chin &amp; it made my chin so dry &amp; itchy &amp; red. It looked horrible, like my whole chin was scabbed. It went away after I stopped putting the cream on it for a day or two.""",4
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I used nexplanon for 3 years and looking back I strongly regret it. My first month seemed normal followed by being on my period for 4 month without stopping. After the periods became less frequent my weight started constantly fluctuated all cycling around my period. I&#039;ve gained 30 pounds over these 3 years and I eat healthy and exercise. Additionally, I&#039;ve had terrible mood swings and thoughts of suicide. I never had it taken out because it was nice not having to worry about taking a pill or having something inserted vaginally. I&#039;m having it taken out in 2 days and could not be happier. I do not recommend this at all.""",8
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""When I was 13 years old, I started to develop severe acne. From 13 to 15 I tried many medications over and under the counter, but nothing seemed to have much effect if any at all. Finally, I was referred to a dermatologist who prescribed me Accutane for 3 months. My brother (a year older than me) was going through the same thing &amp; was also prescribed Accutane, but for 5 months. We both experienced ineffably dry lips (like a desert) and our skin improved immensely. By month 2, I had very good results and only dry lips as a side effect. I&#039;m now 24 &amp; today I have about 5% of what I used to have, but I&#039;m getting on Accutane again to get rid of it once &amp; for all. Overall, Accutane was great for me &amp; my brother &amp; I&#039;m very happy with the results.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I just started Adipex-P 37.5mg on March 6th, 2011. I am in the military and am a single mom of two. I work and go to school full time so its hard for me to work out everyday even though I&#039;m supposed to. I have never really had trouble losing weight until I started working night shift in May. I would only eat one meal a day but since it was late I gained the weight. I am 5&#039;5 and weighed 184lbs before I was put on this pill. The first day I took it was right after the doctors appointment. By 5pm and I had only eaten one piece of ham. I bought a salad after I took the pill and tried to eat it when I got home at 6 and couldn&#039;t because I had no urge to want to eat. It&#039;s Wednesday now and I&#039;ve lost 4lbs already.""",3
Citalopram,Depression,"""After taking Citalapram for 6 months now and previously years ago, I personally felt it hasn&#039;t worked at all with my depression. It has slightly helped my anxiety but my depression has got uncontrollably worse and I would get up to 40mg. I&#039;m now on mirtazapine, only been on it for a few days but that&#039;s set my nerves off. As after reading the reviews a side effect is weight gain and I certainly don&#039;t want to gain anymore weight. """,5
Lexapro,Depression,"""This was the first medicine I was prescribed by my psychiatrist for my anxiety and depression. While I felt it worked decent, I got wicked headaches and I had terrible night sweats. I also suffered from fits of rage, and I felt really angry in general. To be fair I&#039;m an angry person and I often felt that since I didn&#039;t feel as depressed or anxious any longer, my anger became more prominent. I also felt I had issues reaching orgasm at times, but then others I would feel insatiable. All in all, it was okay but I definitely ended up switching at my monthly appointment.""",5
Liletta,Birth Control,"""i got the litletta put in about 3 weeks ago. I had started my period a day before normally last only a week or so , putting it in  wasn&#039;t that bad I did flinch a little but wasn&#039;t too bad.... I had just had my baby 7 weeks before. it only felt like a pinch and I was cramping for like 20 min afterwards and that&#039;s it. I have felt a bit bloated here and there and iv been spotting since.... ill update in a bout a month to see how its going. oh and that same day my doctor did a sonogram to make sure it was in place and it was. but so far so good just waiting on the spotting to stop.""",8
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I have had bad acne since the 4th grade. During my senior year in high school, I was put on Accutane which worked for the duration of time that I was on it (moderately, mild breakouts but the redness went away, a huge step up from my ridiculous acne!) but returned in moderation when I went to college in the fall. I waited until the spring to visit my dermatologist and she put me on two facial creams and Monodox. I tried the facial creams alone, didn&#039;t work. Then tried Monodox and within a week, I saw a huge difference. Not only did my acne almost disappear, but my breakouts were 1-2 mild, small pimples that went away leaving no scars in 2 days. I have been on it about 3 months and I couldn&#039;t be happier. My face is clear! Highly recommend.""",4
Adderall,ADHD,"""36 year old female diagnosed with ADHD. Started on Concerta 30mg daily (2 weeks), no therapeutic effect but had extreme dry mouth, a crash/grogginess in the evenings. Switched to Adderall XR 20mg daily, no therapeutic effect; experienced dry mouth and slight loss of appetite during day, made up for it in evening. Just started 40mg daily and I feel the therapeutic effect. Profound concentration at work, desire to tweak processes, love getting things done, a non-stop interest in being productive with everything. I have this sense of crystal clear clarity of my surroundings, like HDTV sight. Around 5pm, I still feel a crash and extreme tiredness. I will see if I can take a short acting pill to get me through the evening. VERY PLEASED NOW.""",1
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I took my self to the hospital because my life was (and still is) falling apart. But after I took Prozac, I started the feel a bit better. But just as someone here mentioned, after I took it my mind felt empty, for example, since before I went to the hospital, thoughts of self hatred, self loathing and plenty of suicidal thoughts took up 90% of my brain each day. but since they were gone due to the medicine, my brain was unsure how to react. The worst thing in the world could have happened to me and I wouldn&#039;t do anything just smile. But it felt weird. But I did feel a strange sense of optimism while on the drug. I&#039;m NEVER optimistic, always pessimistic. I stopped months ago. I think I&#039;m going to the hospital soon anyway.. I feel it.""",5
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I started a cycle of doxycycline last June because of my horrible summer breakouts.  I experienced dramatic results after about 6 weeks; my skin had never been clearer.  I stopped taking it after 8 weeks and experienced  a few pimples here and there.  It is now February and I&#039;m pretty much back to square one with my acne. I started back on doxycycline last week.  Best advice I can give: be patient, it takes a while but you&#039;ll eventually see great results.""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve been on this for a month and am at the full dose. I was dieting and exercising before this and was looking for something that would simply kill my appetite. I&#039;ve used Phentermine before, which worked great at killing my appetite but also killed my libido, which won&#039;t work. I have to say I&#039;ve not really experienced the appetite suppression I hoped for. I&#039;m still hungry and just forcing myself not to eat. But I could do that without this and have done so in the past, so I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s doing anything for me. It&#039;s a bummer because I was really hoping this would work. I&#039;m going to give it until the end of this first bottle, which because of the build-up actually last a month and a half, then I&#039;m probably done if nothing changes.""",2
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Before this IUD I was on the pill for about 3 years. I have now been on this IUD for 5ish months and I was told that my period would lighten and maybe even go away and cramping would be minimal. While I was on the pill my period was 4 days and didn&#039;t have much cramping. When I was getting the IUD I was SO excited to maybe not have to deal with a period anymore??? I got my hopes too high because now my period is 8 days if I&#039;m lucky and the cramps I get are almost unbearable. And not to mention the pimples I now get... I love the IUD because of how effective it is and you don&#039;t have to worry about taking a pill at the same time everyday, but oh my goodness every time I get a cramp I want to cry... I wish I was as lucky as some other girls""",8
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""This is one dangerous drug as for me it made me feel half dead to me and the world around me it made my depression even worse and anxiety really bad to the point I was unable to do the things I wanted to enjoy. Was unable to settle..It put me in a dark place and gave me really bad dreams and good luck if on it more than 6months to come off, may the force be with you, it&#039;s a horrific experience so please keep clear!""",5
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started taking phenyermine 37.5 on March 5, 2017. 
I am 28 with 3 kids. I&#039;ve had trouble losing weight from my last pregnancy which was over 3 years ago. I&#039;m very short so any little amount of weight on me looks like a lot compared to taller or even average height women. 
My goal is to lose at least 60 lbs. 
so far I have lost 10 lbs. 6 of those lbs were lost in the very first week of taking this. 
I don&#039;t eat much and I definitely need to work on water intake but I only drink water. I exercise and walk often.""",3
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I was prescribed 3 mg tablets for insomnia. The first night I took one about 45 minutes before bedtime and did not find it helped me sleep at all. However, I was extremely groggy the next morning and ended up back in bed by shortly after lunch, sleeping for almost 2 hours. I tried it two more times, taking it earlier each time, but the effect was the same: it takes too long to work and leaves me groggy and unable to function the next day. I will not be taking it any more.""",0
Vilazodone,Depression,"""Viibryd has lifted me out of the depths and has helped me put meaning back into my life. It&#039;s not a miracle, however, it does lift the burden of depression to a point where I am capable of utilizing skills and coping strategies effectively. It&#039;s expensive and it&#039;s very very new. I experienced very mild side effects at the beginning of treatment such as mild nausea and migraine in addition to panic attacks that eventually went away (thankfully) but these symptoms dissipated within two days of each initial titration. I&#039;m currently at 40mg and I&#039;m feeling great. I&#039;m one of the lucky ones I suppose as I have not had to try too many medications.""",5
Tapentadol,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been taking Tapenadol (palexia) moderate release for about 6 months now. I was previously prescribed Transtec 35micogram/hour which after 3 years stopped working. I suffer from chronic pancreatitis and for a 30 yr old man is a lot to suffer from such a young age. Anyway I found palexia to be an extremely helpful pain killer. Having said that I feel they last no where near the 12hour half life they claim to provide relief for. I currently take 2x150mg MR per day. I strongly feel I would benefit from an IR pain killer during the day. I am aware that there is a IR version of Tapenadol although I feel I would get more benefit from 2-3 oxynorms per day to fill the void I&#039;ve been left with in my pain management. Any1 else feel the same??""",9
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I have been using Atralin for about a month and a half now. I started out with very moderate acne, a few pimples but nothing substantial. I have been struggling with acne for five years and I just wanted something to totally zap my acne. Well Atralin is NOT that. I have very sensitive skin and I am still peeling after all this time. When I started using it it made me breakout and now my acne and red spots are worse.""",4
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I had my implant inserted in July 2010, and the first 6 months I was very happy! Barely bled, only gained a few lbs and no other side effects. The past year however has been absolute hell. I have 2 weeks of heavy bleeding followed by 1 week of none, continuously. I have also gained about 30lbs without changing my diet or lifestyle at all, as I am an active, healthy person. Also about once every two months I get horrible stabbing pains in my lower pelvis all caused by side-effects. After finally confirming it was the Implanon that is making me ill I have finally got an appointment to get it removed.""",8
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Ok this is where i am after two weeks. I&#039;m turning 54 one of these days, Managing Director of my company and self diagnosed with ADHD about a month ago. I matched ALL the criteria. Went to see a doctor and he confirmed my suspicions. I relayed my struggles with studies at University and he referred to me attaining two degrees a &#039;miracle, I cannot begin to explain how difficult studying was not to mention having to sit through hours of lectures. There was no - and I stress - NO filter between my brain.mind and my mouth. Anger,profanity and impulse behavior was only curbed by my life-long ability to be able to fall asleep anywhere, anytime. Imagine an alien being in charge for 53 years. It&#039;s all gone. Why did no one help me with this before?""",1
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started this drug 2 months ago.  I&#039;ve lost 19 lbs since I started, but not totally positive it&#039;s because of the drug.  This is supposed to suppress your appetite, and mine has been full on since I started.  I&#039;ve also had quite a few side effects, some I&#039;ve seen mentioned, some not:
Constipation-  It&#039;s usually a few days between and typically fairly painful
Nausea- This is new.  2 months in and it was really bad.
Light Headed- This came with the nausea.  Combined it was so bad I couldn&#039;t look at my phone and I couldn&#039;t drive.
Muscle Fatigue- My legs were fatiguing 20 mins into a workout, which is really abnormal for me. """,2
Ritalin,ADHD,"""What can I say, dx with mild ADD too (who isn&#039;t anymore)  But this taken with Effexor XR has helped very much with apathy, motivation, energy and enjoyment of life!  Dr.&#039;s reluctantly Rx this bc it is Schedule 2 substance and is mostly Rx&#039;d for ADD/ADHD but it has a profound effect in boosting the effects of an antidepressant.  Taken alone for depression?  Not really a good idea bc it wears off fast.  I take 20-30 mg a day (TID)""",1
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""I have had sleep problems for twenty years now due to pressure of work &amp; probably a predispostion to insomnia. Have used various sleep aids benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine, etc. I am affected by both difficulty going to sleep &amp; staying asleep. Recent reports concerning sleep aids &amp; Alzheimers put me off using. Melatonin not implicated as far as I know so I have turned back to that!! Dosage 6mg slow release one hour before bedtime. As on previous occasions it is mild with no noticeable side effects. Worth a try!""",0
Lutera,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this pill for a little over a month and I love it. (Knock on wood) but I haven&#039;t gotten any really bad side effects like most pills I&#039;ve read about. On this pill I&#039;ve lost my crazy appetite that I used to have, my breasts feel like they&#039;ve gotten smaller, I don&#039;t have mood swings, or feel depressed or anything. The only negative thing is, even though I&#039;m glad it made my hair longer, it made my hair in other places longer and it grows back faster (which I can manage but it&#039;s a little annoying having to do my eyebrows ever other day). I&#039;ve also had headaches but not sure if its from the pill and I had my period for 2 weeks straight but my doctor said its because body is getting used to the pill.""",8
Minocycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on solodyn (minocycline) for about a week now and it&#039;s definitely helped. I never had the bad initial breakout like some do but my cheek acne hasn&#039;t completely cleared up, still getting some cysts and whiteheads. Hopefully will get 100% better within the next few weeks. 
Ps I went on doxycycline for three months last year and cleared me up completely but broke out worse than ever after I got off of it so be careful and have a plan when you get off of these kinds of antibiotics.""",4
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""I agree with the other reviewer that this drug has minimal side effects.  However, my 7 yr old son has a significant rash, which Doctors suspect may be from the Intuniv.  The rash is not itchy, just unattractive and widespread. We have been using the Intuniv for 2 1/2 weeks, but may have to stop due to the rash.
Here&#039;s the results we&#039;ve seen on this medication:  better moods, less aggression, only minimal improvement with attentional/focus issues, and slight improvement in impulsivity.  Sleepiness has NOT been an issue, even though I had read many reviews and the label that said it might be.  My son has taken every ADHD drug out there except two (literally) and this one is very gentle on the body in comparison (except for the rash).""",1
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I am 33 years old, and my son is 7 years old and we both have ADD and ADHD respectively. 

His mom started him off with 20mg of Vyvanse and it seemed to help out his behavior and focus problems at school. The only thing is the poor kid is losing weight. I was curious about the side effects and wanted to see if it could help out with my focus. So I started taking Vyvanse as well. It has been okay. I like the fact that I can stay on task and not go from idea to idea and not stick to one thing, but there are major withdrawal symptoms and I tend to be a total space cadet if I don&#039;t take it.""",1
Accutane,Acne,"""I am 17 years old. Since I was 10 years old I have had mild acne. I used to cry to my mom before school at least two times a week because of my acne. I would stay home on weekends instead of going out with my friends because I was ashamed of my skin. I tried every pill and cream out there. Literally. Right now I am on my last month of accutane. It is still clearing up a bit but it is almost all the way clear. My skin was very dry in the beginning but then I started taking vitamin E and I got a dehumidifier for next to my bed which both helped a lot. My lips also got very chapped and dry but I put aquaphor on to help it. My mouth was more dry than usual but nothing severe. It changed my life and I&#039;m so happy that I started taking it.""",4
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I have been on zolpidem for several years and only take about 2.5 mg of my 10 mg tablet.

The second night I took a 10 mg  table at around 9 PM I still do not feel sleepy so around 11 PM I took another 10 mg tablet and within 30 minutes  I felt weird and I knew I was going to have a rough night ahead of me and I was not going to get a good quality night sleep, which I did not!!!! The next morning which was Saturday (THANK GOD I didn&#039;t take 20mg  during the weekday) I felt horrible all day long and napped throughout the day up until 5 PM where I force myself to get up eat something drink a Mountain Dew just to feel alive again!!!  
This medication is horrible""",0
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I have had nexplanon since 3/31/14 and it is a very effective birth control with little to many effects depending on the person. I have had some effects which are irregular menstrual cycles and weight gain which the doctor did say was very common. The first 3 months my period was 2 weeks long every month after that it went to 3 days a week for 2 more months. And from their I&#039;ve had light spotting a few days out of the month and now I have no period due to nexplanon. I have also gained 20lbs. Also nexplanon has cleared up all of my acne with in the first 6 months of having it. Keep in mind this birth control lasts three years and it all depends on the person and the effects that will occur. Despite the effects it is very effective and safe.""",8
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m from the UK and live in London so obviously the NHS pay for it to be inserted/removed. I got mine in June and needless to say I reacted bad instantly. The bruising and swelling I had was ridiculous, not only need I get long stripes of bruising on my arm and lost feeling I also woke up the next day not being able to open my right eye (my implant is in my right arm) within 3 weeks I started to get a few spots which developed into acne I also gained around 14lbs and now deal with anxiety and minute depression. Around 6 of my friends have it and they all love it but I&#039;m afraid for me I had to get it removed after 6 months- it also changed my hair type it gets very greesy (so does my hair). Please be aware of the side affects!""",8
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I have been on this for 4 months initially for weight loss to reduce blood sugar. I have lost 40 pounds and 4 inches of waist.  The scale down program is amazing and frankly I would make any co pay to get this result rather than take diabetes meds. I am wearing clothing I haven&#039;t worn in over 10 years. My only side affect is constipation which is slowly subsiding and hot flashes/sweating so I walk around with hankies.  On the whole this drug is amazing. I am more active and focused and less moody too.""",3
Contrave,Obesity,"""I have been trying to lose weight since October 2015. Well, long before that, but October was when I became desperate. I suffer from depression, which had made me gain 16lbs in 2015 alone. I went to my doctor and asked about Contrave after doing extensive research. I was on Wellbutrin for depression and I felt like it had stopped working so I opted to go off of it and that allowed me to start Contrave. I filled my prescription on December 16th. The drug made me  tired, but I never woke up tired. I woke up feeling very well rested. Very slight headaches now and then, but nothing horrible. That was the only side effects I have had. It is 1/3/16 now. I went from 216 to 204lbs today. I&#039;m loving it!""",2
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""Have bad insomnia. Been on Ambien for 10 years now. I decreased my dose to only 3 mg about 5 years ago. All I need is to get to sleep. Anxiety prevents that. So Ambien works great for me. I have never had any bad effects at all with this drug. No after effects. Wake up refreshed. I have had instances where it doesn&#039;t work, if I am in a bad anxious state. But usually I take it right before bed. I don&#039;t delay at all because it is pretty fast working. Hope and pray there are no long term effects like Alzheimers. So far I have no memory problems. I am 74. I need sleep. It&#039;s that simple. Feel awful when I don&#039;t sleep. I do try not to take it every night. Go off for days in between. Try and go weeks if I can. So far that&#039;s working for me.""",0
L-methylfolate,Depression,"""Like many others I took the Genomind test which told me that SSRI&#039;s were not optimal and that SNRI&#039;s were a better choice.  After 16 years and 20 different meds, I have had MUCH better success with SSRI&#039;s than SNRI&#039;s.  The test results also said that I was deficient in what Deplin could provide.  I have been taking 15mg of Deplin for almost 3 weeks now and have been experiencing some of the lowest depression that I have ever felt.  Today I woke up feeling just as miserable as I have been for the past 3 weeks so I decided not to take Deplin.

Isotretinoin,Acne,"""My daughter has been taking Accutane for 6 months now and her skin is FLAWLESS! She is so happy!  She has been complaining of back pain, but she is going to a chiropractor and getting adjusted regularly, which seems to help.  At first her lips were terribly chapped!  But I bought some really good chapstick and now she is fine.  She is tired, but she is also a teenager, so that may come in to play.  She would not wear tank tops last summer because her skin was so broke out.  Now I am planning my wedding and she is only looking at strapless dresses!

Butorphanol,Pain,"""I have been suffering from migraines all of my life, before they made Stadol in nasal spray form, I was at the Emergency Room at least twice a month to get a shot of Stadol combined with Phenergan for the nausea.  Finally they came out with the nasal spray, which was great, because not only could I not throw it up, but since it is administered through the nasal passage, it gave me almost immediate relief.  I think that Stadol is the best pain medicine that was ever created, however, it is very addictive, and your tolerance gets to be higher and higher. People that suffer from any type of chronic pain I&#039;m sure will agree with me.""",9
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was very tearful when my doctor prescribed Lamictal because I had only been on SSRI medications in the past (they really messed me up and I was hospitalized). My doctor prescribed me Lamicatal at 25mg for 2 weeks, then 50mg for another 2 weeks, with maintenance at 100mg after that. I was tearful because I was terrified to relive what had happened before. Much to my surprise, Lamictal is what I consider my &#039;life saver&#039;. I feel my moods have been maintained and balanced since beginning this medication. I have not experienced any weight gain at all only headaches from time to time. My libido has actually increased and I read that this medication can affect the menstrual cycle (which it has for me. has made them lighter!). I love Lamictal !""",6
Focalin XR,ADHD,"""I was properly diagnosed with ADHD after knowing all my life, I&#039;m special. And different from the rest of my coworkers and people I meet and met.
I recently lost my job due to a &quot;rightful&quot; blowup at the my Boss&#039;s deputy, which led to all the way to a final write up. Two month later, it was discovered that I wasn&#039;t doing the daily logs, that everyone can do, but I couldn&#039;t do it easily. This behavior led to a Doctor and conclusion, I have ADHD.
At first I was on Vyvanse 20 then 40, this left me speedy and jittery, almost unable to cope in public. So I changed to Concerta XR 36. Mild and cool enough, but I don&#039;t see the difference with my ADHD. So I moved to Focalin XR 25. It&#039;s been an hour since my taking it at 3pm. I feel it.""",1
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I have severe and chronic insomnia that has caused me little (if any) sleep per night, leading to confusion and irritability in the morning, leading to delirium, if prolonged exposure to sleep deprivation was to happen to me. My doctor first prescribed me Seroquel (quetiapine) for my insomnia, which worked a little bit TOO well, as it was too heavily sedating, and left me with too many &quot;morning-after&quot; effects. At my doctor&#039;s reluctance (due to substance abuse history in not me, but my family) I was given a prescription to a starting dose of 1 mg a night of Klonopin. This was amazing. As opposed to being forced to sleep by Seroquel, Klonopin lulled me to sleep. It&#039;s a wonderful medicine.""",0
Absorica,Acne,"""Absorica worked right away. After the second month, I was almost acne-free. However, at the end of my fifth month, it has stopped working. Acne is coming back on my back, chest, shoulders and face. I&#039;m on 60 mg a day, so I might up my dosage. I am now very skeptical of the product, and I am preparing to just accept my acne, because there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. Even isotretinoin didn&#039;t save me.""",4
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Man oh man. Let me tell ya&#039;ll about this implanon birth control. I got this implant in my arm one month after I had my twin girls. I just got it taken out yesterday, I had this piece of shit a little over a year. Putting it in isn&#039;t bad. But I bled for that whole year and one month! Extremely heavy. At one point I thought I had to go to the ER. Not only that hair loss is one of the side effects that they don&#039;t tell you about in the doctors office. My hair has gotten so damn thin it&#039;s a shame. PLUS don&#039;t forget about the acne that never goes away, no matter how many times you wash your face lol. I&#039;ve read that woman gained weight on this, but for me it was the complete opposite, I lost a lot of weight.. Plus constant mood swings!""",8
Paroxetine,Depression,"""My depression is weird, mostly due to tapering off of and recovering from benzodiazepine dependency. I have awful anhedonia and have been watching my life crumble in slow motion over the past year. I know I needed to do something. 

The Paxil is a stopgap solution but so far I&#039;m starting to climb my way out. I can&#039;t really attest to side effects. The worst I guess is a dry mouth and fuzzy thinking, but honestly, I&#039;ve been depressed for so long, I can&#039;t say my thinking has been that great to begin with. I was afraid it would lower my libido and I&#039;d have anorgasmia, but so far no.

My logic is thusly, I may end up losing my job because of &quot;personal problems&quot;. Won&#039;t it be nice if I can actually handle such an eventuality instead of giving up?""",5
Trazodone,Anxiety,"""In the last year I&#039;ve lost my husband, my job, and as a result, I relapsed. Alot of stress, anxiety, and little sleep.  I am now 6 months clean. Began taking trazadone 6 mos ago. After a few months it was not helping me long term.  It would some what relax me, I&#039;d fall asleep, but suddenly, I was awoke after about 3 hrs .  After communicating that, I was told that because of my weight gain now weighing 198, height (5&#039;3&quot;)  that contributed to the non effectiveness, and the fact that on the end of my treatment, I was no longer taking some of the other meds. Anyways, once my dosage was increased to 100mg, and   I&#039;ve felt so at ease, and have slept through the whole night like a baby.   Thank God for Trazadone,  2 thumbs up.""",7
Minocycline,Acne,"""I started getting acne when I was about 12 (when I got my period) I have been suffering from acne for about 3 years now. I have severe acne on my head and breakouts on my arms chest and back. I have been trying off the counter products for the first 2 years. Nothing seemed to be working so I finally went and saw a dermatologist, he prescribed me minocycline I went on it for about 2 weeks and i stopped because I was feeling dizzy and nauseous every time I took it. A good 3 months later I started it again because it was getting worse, I have been on it for about 3 weeks and I have been to the hospital about two times because of the rash all throughout my body and chest pain to the point I cant breathe.( cleared most of my acne up)""",4
Zaleplon,Insomnia,"""I have had an erratic sleep schedule since the end of January of this year.  I had been taking trazodone and it just wasn&#039;t working anymore.  I talked to my Dr.  She suggested Sonata.  I was desperate for a good nights sleep.  I took 1 last night. I believe it is a good idea to relax before you take it.  I slept for 3 to 4 hours. But still felt the calming effect of it and went right back to bed.  Not a full nights,  but hey,  it was better.  I think if we sit and wait for a pill to kick it,  it makes us tense.  I&#039;m going to continue on.  I believe in a weeks time,  I will have a pattern back.  Don&#039;t give up so easily after 1 night.  Give it a chance.  """,0
Divalproex sodium,Bipolar Disorde,"""Didn&#039;t realize how great it was till it was gone. After 4 years of failed cocktails until I found Depekote with  Zoloft. I was on it for 3-5 months @1250mg and had Excessive Weight gain, insatiable hunger,,,BUT Worth it! I was productive, positive, stabilzed, making plans and following thru. Then Liver enzymes high @ 6 mo. and abruptly taken off ... Horrible move by panicked Doctor.  On my third medicine since and all bad results.  Any opinions on Depokote retry while protecting my liver with Milk Thistle &amp; Turmeric? My last blood work was best its ever been. I have no faith in my Dr and am seeking a new.""",6
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I rate this 9/10 because I haven&#039;t used it enough.  I have agoraphobia and anxiety/panic disorder.  Lately, it has been hard for me to leave my house and so I would get anxious inside the car and then at the destination.  Moment I woke, I took 0.5mg on an empty stomach to let it kick in while I brush, change clothes, and later eat.  By time I leave the house, I noticed I didn&#039;t feel any hesitation to step out.  The car ride was calm.  I didn&#039;t sweat, no feelings of wanting to panic.  I was able to browse clothes and shoes without having to do my usual breathing exercises to keep myself relaxed.  It enabled me to shop without worry, panic, and rushing.  I have only taken it twice, a month apart.  No drowsiness or sleepiness for me.""",7
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had the Nexplanon bar in my arm for about 14 months now. If I could warn every woman on earth about this hideous I implant, I would! I am not exaggerating when I say that this implant has ruined my life. Massive multiple times a week migraines, rapid weight gain (50lbs in 14 months), major mood swings and anxiety, random chest pain, random gushes of blood which makes me think I&#039;m having a cycle then it just stop, it has zapped all my energy.. This thing is a nightmare. I get it out in 3 weeks which can&#039;t come soon enough. I do not wish this on my worst enemy. I have thought about taking it out myself on numerous occasions! DO NOT get this form of birth control, please just don&#039;t. I don&#039;t want anyone to go through what I have.""",8
Adapalene,Acne,"""I will be 30 in 3 months and my skin is worse then it was when I was 16! What the hell! I find it interesting that everyone who really enjoyed this product, properly used this product. I was prescribed Differin when I was in my teens and it worked wonders! Now thats its OTC, I recently started using it again. I am at the 4 week point, so yes my face is breaking out. I remember when I first used it years ago the same thing happened and with patience my skin cleared up. I have already noticed a difference in my cheeks which seem to not be breaking out as bad. I am patiently waiting for this period of breakouts to come and go, so I can see those great results once more. I used Differin as a teen and loved it.""",4
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I&#039;m 42, highly successfully in my career and family life but always thought I had ADD or ADHD .  I got decent grades in high school and college but always felt like it was a struggle  and I would have to beat myself up for hours with guilt and fear of failure to produce even passing results.  After 20 years, I&#039;ve decided to actually do something about it.  I tried both Adderall and Vyvanse and Vyvanse is superior because it&#039;s less harsh.  I&#039;ve benefited from it but it does make me anxious..  I take Ativan to help with that..  I&#039;m also on Brintellix. I hate being on tons of meds but if I can increase my quality of life and be a better person it&#039;s worth it.  """,1
Saxenda,Obesity,"""This medication works! Unfortunately I started experiencing horrible burping and vomiting. The incidents progressively got worse. It just started out as burping, then I vomited 1 time, then the next incident I vomited for a couple of hours and then I was sick for 2 days. These did not happen all in the  same week, it was random. I really want to take this med but can&#039;t stand that side effect.""",2
Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am bipolar on 500mg Lamictal, 1200mg gabapentin and prescribed Klonopin. I am prescribed to take it 1.0 two times a day but don&#039;t need to often. When I am hysterical or very angry in which I want to hit someone or tell them off which happens sometimes you take half usually and it works. I take a whole one if its too much to handle. I don&#039;t use it all the time sometimes not even for a week. It&#039;s wonderful for those out if control moments! Klonopin is much better for bipolar, to use than Xanax. Xanax had no effect in me at all!""",6
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""Initially this medicine seemed to work well for me and it made me feel good...so to speak. But all of a sudden , and I do believe it was Wellbutrin XL, I started tripping the f out....I had dreams that were almost real full of insane anxiety, like the inside of my body was shaking and i could feel my teeth make a noise bumping together super fast....I was having imaginations of people above me using dangerous weapons on me through the ceiling and I was not to move out of my bed like I was tied down there forever. I had the most insane trips ever...I had dreams where I had to act certain ways or I was to be punished, it was truly insane... one time I was in my room and I swore I heard rap music and gangsters outside and no one was outside.""",5
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""During the early weeks, insomnia was a problem and Dr was okay with me splitting the 30mg into 15mg morning and 15mg in the evening. Weight gain is my big problem (up 2 sizes). This worried me, so even though this medicine made me feel so much better, I tried to switch to Pristiq-BAD move, anxiety went through the roof. Back onto Mirtazapine and after 6 months dropped to 15mg daily. I felt heaps better and after 6 more months quit again in order to get rid of the weight. Another BAD move. Sure, I lost a few kilos and felt okay for 3 months until the original old stressor loomed and now here I am starting up again. 2wks at 15mg daily, then 2wks at 30mg, I&#039;m not feeling any benefit yet, very depressed and anxious, though getting more sleep.""",5
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""This medication is very activating without making me anxious. I take it for depression, but I also have general anxiety disorder, and OCD. I was a little worried about taking it at first because one of the side effects indicated that it could make anxiety worse, but I didn&#039;t have that problem at all. It definitely helps with depression and lifting my mood. It&#039;s not a &quot;happy pill,&quot; but it is good with getting and keeping you going and not letting depression ruin you and keep you from doing what needs to be done and living your life.""",5
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""My acne was severe before Accutane. I was at the point where I wouldn&#039;t leave the house, I had no social life, it was so horrendous it was emotionally awful and physically painful too, I felt suicidal it was that bad I felt like a monster, tried so many ways to get rid of my acne from the age of 13, nothing worked. It just got worse, turned cystic and then when I turned 21 I decided to take the plunge and go for Accutane, not joking the first 2 months were hell and I felt like giving up, but I carried it on and yeah the side effects like dry skin and lips were bad and I was moody but all I regret is not taking it sooner, my skin is perfect now and glows. I look like a different person, I&#039;d advise this 100%.""",4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""Not obese but med change &amp; back surgery resulted in an extra 20  lbs not normal for me. Doc required tracking of diet &amp; exercise before RX was given and would only write for brand name as generic ramped up potential side effects. Continued regular monitoring &amp; input on necessary long-term diet changes. I lost 30 lbs &amp; have been off for a week. I eat foods I love &amp; that are healthy so no sacrifice there. The energy it provided allowed me to create an AM yoga routine each day. Side effects of dry mouth &amp; less sleep were there but minimal. Pretty tired in the beginning of coming off them but adjusting now. The goals we set together were met &amp; the purpose of a lifestyle change/improvement were accomplished. This is a solution to changing your lifestyle.""",3
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 19 and nexplanon is my very first hormonal birth control, like most ladies have said everyone reacts different with birth control, when I first got nexplanon I was supposed to have my period the following week so the doctor warned me about abnormal periods with birth control but the following I didn&#039;t get my period instead I spotted for two full weeks and after that never had a period aside from spotting a few days after sex but doctor said that&#039;s completely normal plus pregnancy symptoms almost every month but nexplanon makes you&#039;re body think you&#039;re pregnant so pregnancy symptoms are completely normal, other than that no weight gain I&#039;ve noticed a little bit of acne but nothing that skin care won&#039;t fix, so far nexplanon is great """,8
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""Hello Friends,
Well this is my 2nd day on Saxenda and all is well. This is not my first time around the bush, I am a young at heart 61 year old. I tried many many weight loss aids over the years. Victoza, powders, etc..... 
But something happened to me yesterday when I took my first dose of Saxenda, I got a tingling feeling that went all over my body. Which was very surprising to me. My beginning weight is 218.0 and I&#039;m praying that  I can loose 75 lbs that would be a dream come true. I&#039;ll be 143 my goal weight. I noticed the weight made me get chicken neck, and my eye lids started drooping over my eyes. That made my sad, I want to get healthier I started walking and eating better so hopefully this time I can make it! Please wish me luck &lt;3""",3
Depakote,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was prescribed 500mg Depakote twice per day. I does make me feel sleepy and the MD stated I needed to take both in the evening. I did so and awoke feeling like I was jacked up and bouncing off the walls. I thought what the hell is going on. So I took another dose and an hour later had a nap and I was fine. The downside of the medication does make me feel like a zombie. My concentration is nil and confused a lot. Currently I do not have any insurance and when I go to the ER they say just wait to you see your MD next month. I am very frustrated but learned the hard way to not discontinue your medicines. I did so and got in a lot of trouble.""",6
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""I have anxiety &amp; used Valium first to help anxiety as well as sleep Dr started me with 5mg 4x a day for 2 years. It helped but then I built up a tolerance and then 10mg 4 x a day was fine and worked but notice a tolerance again so then after 20 years changed me to alprazolam and wow big difference. I was prescribed 2 mg sticks 4 x a day 120 a month! At first only need 2 a day then shortly I&#039;m on 4 pills 8mg a day and no side effects, powerful at first now almost fell like I need more. But wanted to cut down its been 30 years in benzo&#039;s and keep hearing about withdrawal from the drug? I go a week sometimes without the drug and don&#039;t feel any symptoms. Any suggestions""",7
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I have suffered from generalized anxiety disorder for longer than I care to remember.  Went through too many anti-depressants that all failed.  I was told the Buspar was an &quot;oldie but goodie.&quot;  I was reluctant to even try another pill and was of the notion that drinking wine was going to be my alternate choice, (which I didn&#039;t care to start).  Buspar has been my answer.  It&#039;s brought calm into my life.  I recommend this &quot;magic pill.&quot;""",7
Lexapro,Depression,"""I used Lexapro for a year and a half.  Last resort (I mistrust drugs) for my circumstantial depression and PTSD. I was surprised to find that Lexapro worked great for me. I had almost no side effects starting up or since, it began working in 2 days, I worked up slow from 5 to 10 mg, and stayed at 10mg. A charm: I felt level, smoothed, yet still emotional and alive. NOT numb. Positive, happy mostly, tend toward joy. More tolerant and patient too. It did NOT reduce my libido, but DID cause weight gain.  30 pounds since 08 without changing my very healthy moderate diet. Weight won&#039;t budge, unusual for me. I have begun taper thinking I was ready. I&#039;m shocked that I miss it. I&#039;m a better person on it, the edges smoothed. If not for the FAT, I&#039;d continue.""",5
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I was first given Zolpidem (Stilnoct) by my sister so I could get some sleep on a very long flight. She told me &quot;don&#039;t take it, then go to the loo... you&#039;ll collapse in the aisle and they won&#039;t be able to move you!&quot;. Took one, got as comfy as possible with eyemask, earplugs, blanket etc. Gave up trying to get to sleep after 1.5 hours. Useless.
I was then prescribed them for insomnia several years ago. Fine if I took one occasionally when I was desperate, but if I took them 2 or 3 nights running, I&#039;d swing wildly between murderous rage and suicidal depression. Threw them in the bin before I killed myself or someone else! I&#039;ve been using herbal tabs for years now, and they relax me enough to get to sleep, much better.""",0
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I am literally  so thankful for this medication, even though I don&#039;t even take it anymore.  I took it for 1.5 years. I had horrible insomnia. I was in my first year of med school, and it was getting to the point where my mind was so cloudy, so sick from the lack of quality sleep that I began nearly failing my tests. I had anhedonia, social anxiety, suicidal dreams, no appetite, etc. The first night I took trazodone, my life changed, and all my symptoms washed away. The moment I began sleeping well on trazodone, my grades shot up, my social anxiety was gone, etc etc. This saved me life.""",0
Valium,Anxiety,"""I had ended up in the ER a few times with weird problems like not being able to catch my breath and hyperventilating before I even new they were panic attacks. They started me on Ativan but it made me so hyper and loopy I literately forgot a few days so when I was put on Valium it was a God send. It prevents and treats panic attacks without the loopy feeling and It doesn&#039;t affect my ability to perform daily activities so I&#039;d recommend it to anyone seeking this type of help.""",7
Copper,Birth Control,"""I have had my Paragard for one year, and it&#039;s been great! Insertion was not pleasant, but it only lasts a moment and now it&#039;s nothing but a distant memory. My periods were heavier and my cramps more severe for the first three months, but after that they returned to nearly the same as before. So many people wrote about their terrible experiences that reading up almost stopped me from doing it, and now I&#039;m so glad I got it anyway. Just remember that those who had a negative experience are more likely to post about it, so there&#039;s a bias! It&#039;s also totally possible that it will go just fine and be a fantastic BC method. Don&#039;t be too afraid to try it and see if it&#039;s right for you, you can always take it out if it&#039;s not.""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I suffer from obsessive compulsive personality disorder.   It makes me not want to be around other people so I stay in all the time, which leads to extreme lethargy.  I just lay in bed all day and spiral downward until I have no energy to do anything at all.   Fastin gives me the energy psychologically as well as physically to get out of bed and start doing things.  It does cause some side effects, but these are to be expected with something that works so powerfully.  Only this or Zoloft have helped me to lead a productive life.   With doctors for zoloft, I have to make appointments, pay for insurance, a doctor visit,  the prescription, and wait in line at the pharmacy, none of which I can do after I run out of medication.  Thank you Fastin""",3
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""This has worked wonders for me. I have been on it for just two weeks and it&#039;s amazing how different I felt by day 2. I was suffering with severe depression after a miscarriage and subsequent breakup and I couldn&#039;t dig myself out of a hole. I was dealing with that plus anxiety. I did experience an increase in my anxiety when the daily 150mg of Wellbutrin started to kick in so I started taking half of a .5mg of Xanax for a few days and now that feeling is gone.

I still get sad but I haven&#039;t cried since I started the medication and being in a better mood is very motivating and makes me feel really good.""",5
Vicoprofen,Pain,"""Vicoprofen has helped me greatly for Fibromyalgia, there is still pain I&#039;ll have but that&#039;s not going to cure it but its helped a lot. And I seem to have pretty good energy while taking it. I don&#039;t take more than prescribed so I don&#039;t believe everyone is at risk of becoming addicted to this medication. I have never had any bad side effects with this medicine either. I only took 7.5 mg four times daily which is average.  Good luck you all. Hope this post helps.""",9
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Works like a charm.  It has significantly helped me with concentration- whether sitting in a lecture or retaining my train of thought, restlessness, and some impulsiveness.  One thing- for me, mixing with caffeine is a no-no, as it makes me jittery and shaky.  But I can do a half-caf coffee. Only negative things: tolerance does develop over time, unfortunately; it only lasts up to 12 hours, and as a student, I&#039;m up early and go to bed late, so I take a 10mg Methylphenidate tablet 40 minutes before or after dinner to keep me focused for a bit longer.  Around 1 am though, I get pretty restless.""",1
Tretinoin,Acne,"""Yes it works. That&#039;s the question you have and it does. If you have time read my story it&#039;ll be worth it.

I guess its just a phase. I&#039;ve had acne since 6th grade and its sucked. I finally made an appointment with the dermatologist December 11. He prescribed me Tretenoin also known as retin a 0.1%, the strongest strength. And Clindamycin phosphate lotion as the antibiotic. So I was told to apply Clindamycin every night, and retin a every three nights, but let&#039;s face it. We all think applying it daily will help you get results faster.

Oxycodone,Pain,"""My Primary Care Physician put me on Oxycontin for about a year and a half prior to having shoulder surgery. I had recently started a new job and did not have enough leave time to have the surgery. The only reason I survived and was able to work and have a half way normal life with less pain was through the use of Oxycontin. When I was finally able to have the Rotator Cuff surgery, my Surgeon said I would have to be off of Oxycontin for at least a month prior to the surgery because he could not give me anything stronger for pain after surgery and feared I would have a tolerance and that Oxy that would lessen the effect. No problem, I just stopped taking it. That was when the honeymoon was over.""",9
Orlistat,Obesity,"""I had a gallbladder removal in August 2011 and my weight shot up to 13.4 stones. I have been on these tablets for 3 weeks now and I have lost a staggering 9 pounds. My GP prescribed them to me on a trial basis to see if these would work and yes they have. I have my first weigh in next Tuesday so I&#039;m happy to go back and tell him I&#039;ve lost weight and hopefully he will prescribe me some more.
I do often get side effects but nothing that I can&#039;t handle but it has made me more aware of the foods I should be eating. Exercising. Never did that before and now I do. I do 10 minutes on my Vibro plate am and pm, 20 sit ups am and pm and 10 mins on rowing machine. I also walk from the bus stop to work and back.""",2
Symbyax,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on this for several months and my mentality improved 100%. I have not felt so good in years. I was absolutely amazed by this medicine. 

I am only giving it a 7 for the simple fact that not only did it cause weight gain, but my ankles and fingers stayed swollen and was painful. I tried taking Lasix to get rid of the swelling, but it just never worked. I really hated to come off this medicine.""",6
Tramadol,Pain,"""I have been on so many muscle relaxers and pain control medications while waiting for hip replacements that it was unbelievable. About four years ago my Doctors (Air Force Type) put me on a steady regimen of tramadol 50mg tabs up to 300mg per day dependent on pain and I have been able to completely manage my pain and even walk in short bursts (Sometimes with a cane but that&#039;s still walking in my condition) it is an amazing revelation.""",9
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I just had Mirena inserted a few days ago. The insertion was not as painful as I had expected, mainly uncomfortable. I had it put in as a reliable contraceptive after my first baby was born. My OB told me numerous times that the mirena is recommended for women who have already had children. I have no complaints about it so far. There was some pretty bad cramping after it was first inserted for maybe 10 minutes. But that&#039;s kind of a given considering something is being placed into your cirvix hole..""",8

After weaning off, dr. put me on low cal, low carb diet with a prescription diet aid that worked but scary. I continued ti lose after stopping rx diet pill but then plateaud for a long time and started gaining slowly. Chose Alli to help things start moving along. So far I&#039;m pleased. Psychologicaly, it helps motivate me since I spent money on an FDA approved diet pill. It helps so I can eat meals a little higher in cal than original diet which makes it more sustainable.

Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had horrible insomnia since I was a child. Diagnosed with severe sleep apnea a few years ago.  Ambien is not the holy grail.  You build up a tolerance over the years but 12.5 is as high as most doctors will go ) from 10, 8 years ago).  Pluses for Ambien - it will put you to sleep; no half-life so no grogginess in the morning.  Minuses- it will put you to sleep but generally not keep you asleep.  Thus the waking up wide awake at 3 a.m.  There is now intermezzo - and sublingual 3.5 dose of Ambien meant for  this problem - works for me 50% of the time- otherwise I just stay up.  Another minus - if you take Ambien on a full stomach IT WILL NOT WORK. I generally eat before 5 and allow 5 hours before I take it.  But in all - a savior!""",0
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Update: 4 weeks and 6 kg down (28kg to go), just started full dose with no side affects, no lingering affects. Hunger back slightly but still cannot eat large portions, feel full all the time, sugar cravings continue to be significantly reduced. Interesting bonus is not feeling like drinking alcohol-one/two glass of wine is enough for me now, if at all. Just got my first script filled @ $387 AUS for one month at the pharmacy, ouch. My private health insurance (Medibank Private) covers some - will provide update of how much next post after I submit the claim.

Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Started on 18mg and did not notice any difference in my ability to concentrate, but noticed that my appetite had decreased. My dosage was switched then to 32mg and I noticed that my attention span had increased slightly but the more noticable change was to my mood and my anxiety. My hands shake from this medication and I get hot flushes although my hands are cold and clammy. I sweat more unconsciously and this is uncomfortable. I went back to talk to my psychiatrist and was told that side effects tend to even out, and sometimes an increase in dosage can speed up this process, so I went up to 54mg. Although the medicine has made a change in my attention, my appetite has gone in the day and I have lost around 7kgs.""",1
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I got Nexplanon May 9th 2014, insertion was quick and painless my arm was bruised for a few days but didn&#039;t hurt at all. The first thing I noticed was that I was hungry 24/7 and a little emotional also I got I little constipated. Didn&#039;t bleed or spot till when my period was supposed to come and it was not a regular period it was much lighter but I did get bad cramps. I was bleeding for a week and then it went away.

I want to lose 50 lbs so I can be around to watch my children grow up.  I have been so miserable for so long and felt nothing would ever help me.  I am loving this drug.  I am struggling with a few side effects: dizziness, racing heart, and trouble sleeping.  The dizziness goes away when I drink water, so I think my body is just keeping me hydrated.  The racing heart is usually when I sleep.  I will talk to my doctor about that.  All in all though, I now have hope which is more than I&#039;ve had in a long time!""",2

Each drug is different for each person but this one works the best for me so far. I feel calm and happy during the day. The only problem with it for me, and it is a big one, is that I can&#039;t sleep! I will spend hours in bed with my eyes open, tired, but unable to actually fall asleep. I then have a hard time waking up but once I do then I am awake and not groggy. I am going to talk to my Doctor about it and hopefully he will have a solution.""",5
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I noticed my bipolar disorder around puberty. It took years of trying and waiting out different kinds of medications. 3 years later I found the right ones, after serious depression, rage and manic episodes. Including suicidal thoughts, hurting people and self in bouts of serious rage. For 7 years I&#039;ve been taking 20mg Lexapro for depression, 120mg Lamictal for mania and 0.25mg risperidone to help me chill and sleep at night. It&#039;s worked great. But lately I&#039;ve been having terrifying nightmares and trouble sleeping so I was just prescribed 0.5mg of risperidone. """,6
Dexmethylphenidate,ADHD,"""Im 17 years old and I&#039;ve taken Focalin Xr 30mg for most of my life and as much as it helps in school i would not recommend taking this at all, like most people with adhd I am pretty good socially and when I&#039;m on focalin i become very pannicky, you cant eat and for me i feel like pukigg if i try to eat, my body becomes achy and my mouth gets really dry and mucusy, sleeping is a nightmare, I have tried to make this work, even took it every single day to build up a tolerance, but its always the same thing. Sure, i managed to sit down and get my work done but when the work is done and school done for the day you feel strange, like not in your own skin. A tutor is the best thing that has happened to me along with b12 vitamins.""",1
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I had an IV drip of Dilaudid for herniated discs in my neck. Then I took 2 x 4mg pills. It helped a little with the pain. I have Lyme and Fibromyalgia so my whole body is in pain usually an 8-10 or higher 24/7, 365 a year. I take Dilaudid often but it barely takes the edge off. It should be very helpful for a person not on pain killer long term and they need relief very fast for severe pain. Morphine drip and Dilaudid drip both felt about the same to me even though Dilaudid is supposed to be stronger.""",9
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I&#039;ve only been on this half a week, but I&#039;ve already lost 2 lbs. I&#039;m on the lowest dosage of 0.6 mg. I&#039;ve had chronic weight gain for 2 years and lost 30 lbs last year, but in 2 months gained it back plus an extra 10 lbs (while still dieting). The doctors are speculating I have PCOS or it&#039;s birth control related as I am only 18 and this quite abnormal for my age. After my first shot I felt the effects immediately. I have 0 hunger and 0 cravings. I&#039;ve been forgetting to eat actually because I always feel full. I do have some minor nausea which makes it hard for me to eat, but I think that&#039;s a plus because it&#039;s making it easy for me to stick to my diet. I&#039;m on weight watchers and sticking to a low sugar high protein diet.""",2
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien or its generic since it first came out in samples at my doctors office.  I quickly graduated from 5 mg to 10mg and have been on it ever since.  The brief period of time that my insurance didn&#039;t cover it, there was no relief for me. They tried tranxene (pharmacist said insurance co recommended) and that was a joke.  I too am a chronic insomniac with chronic migraines and no sleep equals migraine.  2 years ago my family Dr cut me back to 5mg  ( due to the &quot; women shouldn&#039;t take 10mg) insomnia and migraines raged to new limits.  returned to 10mg.  Even during my brief hospital stays over the past few years, the nurses do NOT need to put a bed alarm etc on me because I suffer from ZERO side effects. This is a lifesaver""",0
Abilify,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have taken Abilify for around 5-6 years. I initially was prescribed it at the age of 15 which is way too early in my opinion. However its had relatively few side effects, and has by and large helped me from my tendency to veare towards psychosis or extreme mood swings. Don&#039;t try and get off this drug on your own, it can have horrible consequences. I&#039;m not totally sure what was the Abilify withdrawal and what was my illness, but I had some very extreme mania, that may have been a side effect of withdrawal. Overall Abilify is a very serious drug, don&#039;t take it lightly, and I wouldn&#039;t recommend it for depression. But it has helped me tremendously, and I don&#039;t have much else to say that is negative about it.""",6
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got my IUD inserted 9/13/17 so yesterday:) and my overall experience was not too bad! Expect that when they insert there will be an overwhelming burning , bad cramp that lasts really over 15/30 seconds, my doctor was amazing and made my entire insertion experience within under 10 mins, just know, the medicine they prescribe you to take the night before WILL cause cramping, I didn&#039;t even think of it so I went to bed all peaceful and woke up sweating to very bad cramps, and then the the day you get it expect bad cramps for a couple hours and it&#039;ll go away, and then the all today I didn&#039;t experience any cramping what so ever and then surprise! Spotting = period on the right time, cramps are back! It&#039;s very exhausting but no babies for me!""",8
Citalopram,Depression,"""I have been on Celexa for nearly two weeks and it has been a huge help. I can finally get up, bathe, get dressed, and go out. I am able to take my children to school and actually function. This is my first time taking meds but I am open to them since I have educational background in mental health. I am a grad school student and was first put on Prozac but after nearly two weeks I went from severe anxiety to falling into a deep, terrible depression that left me unable to function. My Dr. immediately switched me to Zoloft but after only 4 days I became severely nauseated, so once again I was switched to Celexa, and finally I can say that now I have gotten some serious relief. Only side effects are itching and dizziness. Good luck to you.""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am productive but I am not myself, I can&#039;t sleep.  I stay up for days on end because there is so much I have to do.  My body just wants rest, my pulse is pounding behind my eyes.  I can&#039;t remember the last time my body or my mind allowed me to eat, hunger is a distant memory.  I am gregarious in conversations and go off like Charlie Sheen.  I have stayed up for days, until white walls turned orange.  I have been on Vyvanse for a year and before that Medidate, Stratera, Concerta, Daytrana, Ritalin, Adderall.  I don&#039;t know who I am outside of my daily dose because I&#039;ve been fed since I was 9, I&#039;m 21 now. I have a 4.0 GPA, I am miserable. None of these are good, the alternative is worse.""",1
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""Not perfect but pretty close. Switched from Paxil(no emotions)-&gt; Wellbutrin(aka severe anorexia)-&gt;Effexor. Basically all medications were pretty decent at anxiety coverage. I found Paxil to be the best without thinking of anything but anxiety attacks. Wellbutrin to be the least effective. Effexor was somewhere in the middle while still letting me enjoy life with an occasional anxiety attack. Since I&#039;ve been on Effexor I&#039;ve had maybe 3-4 small anxiety attacks in the span of 2-3 years.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been taking Phentermine since Aug 09, for about 3 months now and I&#039;ve lost 30 lbs. It&#039;s helped me lose about 10lbs a month. First two months I didn&#039;t exercise with it. This month it has been the first time I exercised with it and it even helps more. Extra lbs come off with exercise, but just taking the pill alone does fine. When I do feel hungry and I start eating I don&#039;t eat as much as I think I&#039;m going to. Normally it&#039;s a few bites and I&#039;m already full. It also gives me a lot of energy, so not only does this drug help me lose weight but it also helps with my procrastination on everything.""",3
Aviane,Birth Control,"""I really like this birth control. I first got on it when I was experiencing terribly painful cramps that made me throw up. Once I started taking the pill, everything was instantly better. No cramps at all, skin looked great, mood was fine. I was perfectly happy. However, when I was off the pill for a month, the painful cramps came back and I was vomiting. This is the best birth control I&#039;ve had. I recommend it for everyone.""",8
Librium,Anxiety,"""I&#039;d suffered from ongoing anxiety and found my usual antidepressants were not working anymore. Also I was going through a very stressful period, and not sleeping or eating well.
My GP prescribed librium for a short period of time. I found it really effective. My sleep and appetite returned and I was coping much better with anxiety. It&#039;s been two weeks now and I am going to ask if I can continue taking it for a bit longer.
I have had no noticeable side effects.""",7
Qsymia,Obesity,"""I have lost 34 pounds since June 10 (almost 14 weeks). On the 7.5 mg level I suffered many of the side effects. My doctor suggested I go back to the beginning dosage of 3.75 mg and I feel so much better. The mental fog, insomnia and chronic constipation and headache are gone. I am still losing 1-2 pounds a week. My appetite is under control and sweets hold little appeal. I still recognize an emotional longing to eat when I am stressed or in the evening when watching T.V. """,2
Geodon,Bipolar Disorde,"""Geodon at 80mg makes me dazed, confused and dumb as a rock.  I lost my job due to it (forgetfulness, can&#039;t concentrate).  For Bipolar II and me, it&#039;s not a drug for me, but when I complain to the doctor that I want to come off Geodon, he increases it!  I am in the process of changing doctors, but in the meantime, I am hostile and negative to the world, especially my partner.... not good! """,6
Duac,Acne,"""I&#039;m 26 and have suffered from severe spots since my early teens.
I&#039;ve been using this cream for around 3 weeks now. 
I had quite severe spots on my chin that would become really sore. My Dr gave me duac along with tablets to take for 6 weeks. I&#039;ve noticed such a massive improvement already and I&#039;ve got so much more confidence. 
It does dry your skin but I&#039;ve started using cleanser and a cleansing oil after washing my face and I&#039;ve got no dry skin.
Only apply to areas that need it because it can make your face really red and itchy. 
Overall I think it&#039;s brilliant I&#039;m so glad I finally went to my Dr """,4
Silenor,Insomnia,"""I have had depression, anxiety and insomnia issues for decades, and have tried many approaches for these issues, including psychological, sleep study, endocrine, chiropractic, acupuncture, herbal formulas, homeopathics, aromatherapy, exercise, meditation, diet, and too many depression and insomnia medications to count. While I have had some success, especially with more natural approaches, I found this past several years that NOTHING helped, or it didn&#039;t help for long. My doctor recently gave me some Silenor samples to try, and I was absolutely blown away by their efficacy. I took the lower dose of 3mg 30 minutes before bedtime and slept great all the way through the night, 8-9 hours! No side effects, either. I wish I could afford them!""",0
Ortho Tri-Cyclen,Acne,"""I started taking this because my cycle was every 23 days and I heard that it could help with acne too.  I never had bad acne just one or two on my chin the week prior to my period.  But after taking this my acne is worse than it has ever been.  I&#039;ve been getting cystic acne all over my cheeks and chin.  And the worst part is that they severely scarred my skin and I never scarred before taking birth control.  I&#039;ve heard that in the first few months it can get worse before it gets better but I&#039;m on my 9th month and it just continues to get worse.  But I do like that it completely regulated my period to a 28 day cycle.  I&#039;ve decided to switch to a lower hormone birth control to see if that will help the acne subside.""",4
Strattera,ADHD,"""I started taking Strattera a few weeks ago for ADD. I have noticed it makes me really calm compared to my usual ways. It helps me focus a little better than I used to but I am still not really focused during class. I take 80mg a day, yes I know that&#039;s a lot but that&#039;s what was prescribed for me. I have completely lost my appetite. Some days go by and I realize I haven&#039;t eaten anything. I have lost 10 lbs. Other than that it just gives me a really dry mouth. I always take over the counter sleep aids so I always sleep fine. I wonder if I should try Adderall? Concerta I have already tried and did not like it.""",1
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;m 21 years old and have been on every acne medication under the sun. 6 years ago I went on Accutane for 3 months and it worked wonders. Completely clear and amazing skin. Being a teenager and going on Accutane meant that there was a good chance my acne would come back - well, it did (about a year ago). Not terribly, but enough to really bother me. My lovely dermatologist put me on doxycycline and it is fantastic! I&#039;ve seen an improvement within 3 days of use. Take it with food and you will not get sick! I&#039;m not talking about a small snack - take it with a substantial meal! I know that everyone is different, but if you want clear skin than you need to stick it out -- Don&#039;t get discouraged!""",4
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I have been taking this medicine for around 4 years. It has helped my anxiety so much. It stops the overwhelming thoughts and panic. I suffered a traumatic event and felt so much anxiety after, I didn&#039;t know what to do. I was prescribed 15mg 2x a day but only take it once and feel that it&#039;s enough. The only side effects I feel are &quot;brain zaps&quot; and dizziness if I forget to take the medicine after a day or 2 but it goes away. It makes me drowsy too but exercise helps with this.  It may have caused weight gain but nothing too over the top. The positive outcome of taking this medicine outweigh the negatives. Everyone is different but this medicine works for me!""",7
Lexapro,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;m 27 years old and have been on Lexapro for about 2 1/2 years now. It has really saved my life. I fought depression and anger problems for most of my life. I tried all kinds of other medicines and nothing helped. I went through a really bad divorce about three years ago and got very depressed. I never really knew how I was treating people until I started taking Lexapro and getting better. I felt good about my life. Lexapro saved my life when I thought there was hope. I&#039;m so thankful. The only side effect I&#039;ve had is a little weight gain. I don&#039;t like the weight gain but I wouldn&#039;t give up Lexapro for anything.""",6
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I was experiencing awful panic attacks and anxiety that wouldn&#039;t let up, I tried so many medications but Cymbalta was the one that worked best for me.  Started at 30 mg for a week then went up to 60, then up to 90 mg where Im at now.  Only down side was it seemed like it took a long time to get here almost back to normal after almost 2 months but I&#039;m glad I&#039;m here, have not had a panic attack in weeks, anxiety is down and I&#039;m off all benzos.  Stick with this medication it did wonders for me and I&#039;m very sensitive to medications.""",7
Lunesta,Insomnia,"""This drug worked wonders for me! I had terrible insomnia, and was averaging only a few hours of sleep a night. I started taking 2mg of Lunesta a year ago. It helped me with anxiety and allowed me to get 8 hours of sleep a night.

I have always been afraid of forming a dependency on sleep aids, so after one year of using Lunesta I weaned myself off, just to put my mind to ease. It was very easy to do! I cut my pill in half for a few weeks, then stopped taking it. No withdrawal symptoms. I then decided to keep taking 1 mg but its comforting for me to know that I&#039;m not dependent on it.

Taking this drug was the best decision I ever made. If 
I swallow it immediately with water, I don&#039;t get a bad taste.""",0
Victoza,Obesity,"""I am in a clinical research study. I began this in July 2011.  At first I lost a lot of weight quickly (about 15 lbs in 2 months).  I lost 21lbs altogether.  My appetite was nil and my blood pressure went down!  But after about a year, the appetite is back in full swing and blood pressure is going back up.  Have also gained 10 pounds back.  Also still pre-diabetic.  I guess after a while it stops working.  I have 1 more year to go in the study.""",2
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed this drug for anxiety I took it home and managed to take it for 2 days but immediately noticed severe insomnia that after two days made me stop taking it. On top of the inability to sleep despite feeling tired I had absolutely zero appetite. In the little over 48 hours I had only managed to eat a handful of cherries... 
However when I was on the drug I did notice less irritability and increased fatigue which I attributed to not sleeping or eating.""",7
Toradol,Pain,"""I have fibromyalgia and severe costochondritis, dx&#039;d in 2010. After nearly a week of a nasty pain flare and then I fell. That just made it worse, the last straw. So I went to emergency room. 

Was absolutely shocked they couldn&#039;t (by Canadian law) give opioids or anything like that for pain relief when my pain was nearly 3x it usually is. Felt like I totally wasted my time calling the ambulance and waiting for hours to see the emerg doc.

Then he offered Toradol and I got a shot of it soon thereafter. I was amazed how it worked, my pain literally just drained away within 10 mins or less. I had not felt that close to being pain free in well over a decade. I cried tears of disbelief and joy. Getting it in pill form asap!""",9
Asenapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have tried almost every medicine you can think of for bipolar 2 with horrible side effects.  Seroquel, Lamictal, Depakote, Lithium, Abilify, Trileptal, Topamax just about everything like I said and either had hives, rash or just could not tolerate them.  My new doctor gave me Saphris and within three days I felt better than I had in 15 months.  After three weeks at 10mgs a day once a day I almost feel like my old self again.  This is a miracle as far as I am concerned the only side effect that I have is feeling weak slightly winded when I walk or exercise. Don&#039;t know if anyone else feels this or not.  It does bother me because I can&#039;t keep up walking or in Pilates class like I used to.""",6
Cymbalta,Pain,"""Been on 30mg Cymbalta for 2 weeks. Started getting relief by the 2nd day. Am 58 year old male with spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and spondy. Plan was to go to 60mg but I am getting enough relief at 30mg. I believe I will try to stay on that dose to minimize side effects. Some constipation, difficult reaching orgasm, some night sweats and minor headaches. Oh, insomnia if I took it at night.  I had samples of this medicine for 6 months but delayed starting it because of horror stories on the internet. Pain was ruining my life so this medicine seems to be the best option.""",9
Zyprexa,Bipolar Disorde,"""I love Zyprexa (Olanzapine) it has calmed and removed my insanity. I now longer have panic attacks and irritability. I work in retail and i have been in trouble several times with my managers because i snap at costumers. But with Zyprexa it all went away it was amazing........BUT!!! i have to stop taking it because it caused SO MUCH weight gain. I use to weigh 170lbs and within a year i weigh now 226lbs. I don&#039;t even eat that much and i still don&#039;t lose weight. there&#039;s no point going to the gym and doing cardio because the pill prevents me from losing it. So now i have to ask my doctor to give me a medication that doesn&#039;t cause weight gain for i can lose the weight. I am so depressed that i have to stop taking it. it has worked wonders 4 me""",6
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My 8 year old son has been on Daytrana for approximately 6 months and I have to say of all the ADHD medicines out there this is the best. We have tried almost every ADHD medicine out there and nothing lasted as long as it was supposed to or had no effect whatsoever. The only problem with the patch is its sticking. It never seems to stick and in the summer I had to find something waterproof to put over it.""",1
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""Worked very well. Did have next day drowsiness, but only the first day. Am only taking 10mg. I had none of these bizarre side effects I&#039;ve read about. The important thing for me is that this is NOT a benzodiazepine. More researching is showing that benzodiazepines and other GABA activators may be causing permanent memory loss, that includes Zolpidem. I&#039;ve been able to come off my Gabapentin and Lorazepam at night.""",0
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been on and off phentermine since 2009, and I always have great results. I have a terrible binge eating condition and unbearable sugar cravings. Phentermine completely changed my cravings to salads and unsweetened foods. I also have insomnia from hunger and digestion problems. I sleep like a baby on the medication and I find that reading and focusing are much easier. I got the best results working out on an empty stomach and then taking 1/2 pill, then breakfast, then 1/2 pill or whole pill in the evening. Again, I sleep better on it. I did develop a slight tolerance after the first year, but taking a break really helped me get the full benefit of the medication and refocus on my diet. The side effects are minimal.""",3
Concerta,ADHD,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2nd grade. I have been on medication ever since (I&#039;m 31 now). I started Concerta in high school and I must say it did very well to get me through class in college. I was even in my majors honor society. Now I have to say I think the years of various medicines have caused some real adverse reactions. I&#039;m very depressed and moody. I&#039;ve gone from being the big go getter in my company to borderline at best. Worst of all I have a new son and my anxiety is really getting in the way of me enjoying him.""",1
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""First - diagnosis is mild ADHD. 11 years old. 50mg. Our experience with my son and vyvanse. He was on this medication for approximately 9 months. For the first few weeks, he was sort of hyperfocused and had difficulty with transitioning from a task if he was fixated on it. He transitioned well to middle school and achieved great grades. However, he lost a lot of weight. About 15lbs. He had horrible insomnia. He slowly became very emotional and depressed in the afternoons and evenings. We decided to stop the medication. Within weeks he was back to himself and his doctor advised him to stay off the medication.""",1
Meperidine,Pain,"""The last 4 weeks of my pregnancy, I began suffering severe gall bladder issues. After birth, I tried to tough it out, due to nursing. Ten weeks later (14 weeks on) I was in pain unlike anything I&#039;d ever known! A stone had passed out of my gall bladder into the common duct shared with the pancreas, and had lodged in my pancreas - I was also suffering severe pancreatitis. AGONY would&#039;ve been a blessing. After trying numerous medicines that didn&#039;t touch the pain, I was given Demoral. OH! MY! GAWD! I was in tears, because for the first time in months, I didn&#039;t feel like I was on Death&#039;s door. I&#039;d forgotten what it meant to be pain - free! Every few hours, beautiful nurses came, and &quot;topped me off&quot;. My &quot;con&quot;? For the first 20 minutes, I couldn&#039;t shut up!""",9
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""It&#039;s amazing how well this actually works. I thought I would be stuck with anxiety forever and wondered how I would ever be able to finish uni and find a job. This completely got rid of my social anxiety as well as all the physical symptoms that came with it. I can talk with people normally and for once have some hope that my life could actually turn out well. No more random panic attacks or worrying about minor things either.  No side effects of any sort. I wish I had taken this back in high school when I was first prescribed it but I was too anxious to try any medicine.""",7
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started Contrave &amp; during the 2nd week became so nauseated that I had to stop taking it. About 4 weeks ago I started to take it again, and have stuck with just the ONE morning pill and have been doing great...I&#039;ve lost 12 pounds. BUT and here is the biggest thing for those complaining they are &quot;NOT LOSING WEIGHT&quot; I&#039;m also doing this with the Weight Watchers program, meaning I am taking accountability for the food I am putting into my mouth, I&#039;m eating more fruits &amp; veggies, I am not going to the drive through of McDonalds or eating medium size pizza&#039;s expecting this medication to help me lose weight. YOU have to change your habits or the medication won&#039;t do anything for you. I suggest taking this with a &#039;diet plan&#039; or &#039;eating program&#039;""",2
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have taken Adipex for one month and 4 days, 22 pounds down. Starting weight 240, now at 218. I plan to stay on the pill until I reach 180 lbs. I am a very active person and eat great. First couple days I did have headaches, which only lasted 2-3 days now I have had none.  The boost of energy is nice. I do experience some dry mouth, thankfully I LOVE  water! I&#039;ll post in another month  hopefully I will be under 200 pounds!""",3
Quetiapine,Insomnia,"""Had insomnia for years, due to anxiety and mild panic attacks, also complicated by dystonic tremor in my neck, head constantly twitches, even when lying down.  On a good night was getting 5 or 6 hours broken sleep.  Tried several meds, nothing helped.  Doctor suggested quetiapine, I was a bit reluctant as its such a strong drug but desperate enough to give a try. I&#039;m finally sleeping through every night!  Very constipated when I first started but came right after a few weeks.  Also wake up feeling groggy but am fine once I&#039;m up.   No problems with weight gain.  Using 25mg but thinking about cutting down to 12.5mg.  Love being able to sleep!""",0
Concerta,ADHD,"""My daughter was diagnosed with ADHD in May 2009 on her 8th birthday.  She was put on Concerta and we immediately noticed a difference.  We have had to increase it a couple of times but there has never been a negative side effect. She even noticed the difference in her ability to focus at school and at home.  It has also helped her to maintain her friendships (she not as annoying). I am satisfied with how Concerta has helped my daughter.""",1
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""This replaced Benzosiazepines and Sleeping pills, gives better rest, improved sex drive, decidedly improved social life. I&#039;m 46m, prescribed 15mg x2 daily. Others noted the improvements first. I had no untoward side effects other than dry mouth and a few lingering panic attacks per month easily handed by low dose Xanax 0.5 mg. Various SSRI&#039;s along the way didn&#039;t help with depression this much. 5 years running. It works good.""",7
Nortriptyline,Pain,"""Who knew that a popular non surgical procedure involving the banding of my hemorrhoids would result in neuropathic pain. The pain in my rectum was relentless and unbearable, their was no doubt that nerves were affected. Nortriptyline was prescribed and while not perfect it has taken away a majority of my pain. I would recommend to anyone suffering from nerve pain to consider taking this medication, but you have to be patient it may take a few months to work.
Don&#039;t let pain run your life! Suffering is optional, you do have a choice.""",9
Ativan,Insomnia,"""My experience with Ativan (lorazepam) has been one I&#039;ve come to love and set the bar high when it comes to sleep. I developed insomnia as a result of having to take opioid medication for my CRPS/RSD in addition of the fact that I&#039;m slowly recovering from the death of my best friend who passed in 2010. I have been on every insomnia medicine there is. My current regimen of the normal opiate and muscle relaxants, one to 1.5 grams of Keppra, 555mg valerian root, 10mg of melatonin, 25mg of amitriptyline, and adding up to 4mg of Ativan, depending on the next day&#039;s tasks. Works like a charm every night. """,0
Ortho Evra,Birth Control,"""I started using Depovera as my birthcontrol and I was in it for 2 years plus.  I had no side effects until I gained so much weight the last year I was 120 lbs and now I&#039;m at 150 lbs . I will never go back to it. So I switched to the patch and same I have no bad side effects yet. I&#039;ve been on it for over a year, my weight has gone down I&#039;m down to
140lbs which is hard to loose weight for us girls . My breast sized increased , my thighs and butt increased good plus :) I&#039;ve never had problem with acne with neither birth controls .

Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I reviewed this drug in August of 2014, also with a 9 rating. I want to update my experience, though.

I went from 180 to 140 in around 2 1/2 months. I kept it off completely for 7 months (even through winter and the holidays) after discontinuing belviq. 

However, I quit smoking 5 weeks ago, ordered about 5 lbs of gummy bears to help, and gained almost 10 lbs. I don&#039;t even care. It was worth it to stop smoking, and I started my Belviq again and it&#039;s working beautifully again.

I want to add- my favorite part of this medication is how it eliminates my sugar and carb cravings, even alcohol, and instead makes me crave salads and protein. I don&#039;t know how it does this, but it&#039;s amazing stuff.""",3
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I love my Implanon! Have had Implanon in for about a year and its been great! I&#039;ve gained a bit of weight and have found it a bit harder to lose any extra but if you exercise and eat healthy it shouldn&#039;t be a problem. So I haven&#039;t had a pregnancy and its actually cleared almost all my acne. I guess the extra hormones actually balanced me out. Definitely going for another one when I turn 21. If anything changes I&#039;ll be sure to change my review but so far its the best birth control ever, its out of sight and out of mind.""",8
Hetlioz,Insomnia,"""My experience with Hetlioz has been very positive. I usually sleep 6-7 hours of sleep every night. Every now and then I still have a night I can&#039;t sleep very well as I think my bodies clock is still adjusting to Hetlioz. That being said when I wake up I actually feel rested (even on my bad nights). I feel like I have more energy. My digestion issues are getting better, my mood is better because I don&#039;t feel like I am exhauster. Before taking Hetloz I would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted, even if I slept thru the night. I truly was not functioning well before Hetlioz. I struggled for years with INSOMNIA. I tried many different sleeping medications with no luck until one of my doctors prescribed Hetlioz.""",0
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I didn&#039;t have a good experience with nexplanon. I had an implanon before that and had no problems, but this birth control really did a number on my hormones! It caused major depression, terrible acne, crazy mood swings, and low sex drive. If I experienced any stress at all, I would bleed like having my period. I have discussed several other options multiple times with my doctor and decided to try paragard. The doctor recommended trying a hormone free method, because all of the side effects I&#039;ve experienced are results of imbalanced hormone levels. I know paragard causes longer and heavier periods with worse cramping, but that actually doesn&#039;t sound so bad after my nexplanon experience. I want to go back to having regular periods again.""",8
Trimipramine,Depression,"""I fail to comprehend why trimipramine is not prescribed more by doctors as I have found it to be the best tricyclic on the market.
I am diagnosed with personality disorder, bi-polar condition, PTSD, anxiety and depression. I take Venlafaxine 375mg, Quetiapine 300mg, Trimipramine 200mg and Diazepam 20mg.  
I have been mentally unwell for around 45 years and I have found that Trimipramine is the best tablet for sedation and insomnia, and it gives me enormous relief generally speaking.
The only negative side is a very dry mouth, and I visit my dentist more frequently as the dry mouth can cause teeth decay.""",5
Escitalopram,Depression,"""I am a female, 29 years old and have never battled depression until my dad passed away. My crying and irritablity just getting worse as months went on. I have been on Lexapro for only 2 days but I have noticed a difference in my mood. The very first day I felt a &quot;high&quot;, &quot;weird&quot; sense. It made me sleepy but then restless in the middle of the night BUT I have been already feeling better mood-wise. I am going to try and tough it out because I have more good than bad. We&#039;ll see!""",5
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""Been diagnosed with severe adhd as a child on all the generic medications ritalin aderall aderall xr. Decided to run my life without it and did well for a while til i became 25. As you get older adhd changes and involves more depression emotion and anger while still keeping your energy level and craziness. Vyvanse was prescribbed at a low dose and it is CLEARLY night and day on it.. Emotions are manageable and mind is clear.. One thought at a time. The lights in our mind do go out a tad. Its not so exciting in your own head anymore but you do gain a sense of control that is with ADHD dont even know exists. Some dry mouth and it will keep you up at night if you take it too late. But thats to be expected from amphetamines. Some loss of appeti""",1
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been taking Victoza for almost a month now. I thankfully have no side effects and have lost 8 pounds so far. I have PCOS and for the last 6 years I couldn&#039;t loose any weight. I really tried everything: no sugar , gluten free, low carb ! It feels amazing to finally see the weight come off.  I have not been exercising but Victoza is helping with my cravings , I am almost never hungry and I don&#039;t think about food at all. It s amazing to feel normal again.""",3
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""I have taken Ambien (10mg) on several occasions for short periods of time and it worked just fine (knocked me out in 20min and gave me 5 to 6 hours of sleep). But, my doctor recently added Ambien CR to my nightly cocktail and it has not worked like the doctor or the website said it would. I have been taking it for a week. I expected it to knock me out and keep me asleep. I have done everything like I have been told to do and have been taking it before bed and all it has been doing is taking 3 to 4 hours to knock me out and makes me totally loopy in the morning. The effect is basically lengthened and delayed. I am hoping to switch back to original Ambien  formula when I see the doctor next month!""",0
Morphine,Pain,"""From one who judged harshly people taking this kind of medication I now find myself taking it for the last 3 years. It does not eliminate the pain however it does take it from a 9 to a more tolerable 3 or 4. I am and have been very concerned in regards to addiction and will periodically take myself off for 3 or 4 days, of course the pain is terrible but I need to know I can go without taking it just in extreme pain and can&#039;t ambulate without it. I call it my mini test. """,9
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""I take 30 mg per night and it does put me right to sleep and I sleep for 5-6 hours.  The problem is that it isn&#039;t restorative sleep and I seem to need a nap (with crazy dreams) during the day.  I also am very groggy during the day and a little dizzy feeling. If I wake up during the night to go to the bathroom I fall all over the place.  
I tried to reduce the dosage to 15 mg (since my pills are 15 mg each) and I couldn&#039;t sleep. """,0
Hydromorphone,Pain,"""This medication would be great if they could put it with a transdermal delivery system like the Duragesic patches. I have Continous Segmental Mycolonus and it relieve a lot of the pain. The down side to it for me is that I have to take a pill every 6 hrs and when I wake up in the morning it&#039;s almost tolerable to get out of bed, that is why I prefer the patches. You don&#039;t have to worry about taking any pills for 72 hrs and you go to sleep comfortable and you wake up comfortable, and sleep deeper. It&#039;s a good pain medication for my type of pain.""",9
Fetzima,Depression,"""I have tried every antidepressant in the books over the past twelve years, you name it, I&#039;ve been on it for an extended period of time &quot;waiting for it to begin working&quot; I have bipolar tendencies and panic disorder which has been so bad at times I&#039;ve literally fallen down and been physically crippled for long periods of time, sometimes up to four hours due to hyperventilation.  Recently traumatic events one after the other left me also with a whopping case of depression to top everything off.  My doctor began a starter pack of the Fetizma and now I&#039;m on an 80 mg dose.  My anxiety is all but gone, it leaves me extremely calm without feeling sedated and as an added bonus it seems to have greatly reduced my chronic pain. Life just seems better.""",5
Adderall,ADHD,"""I have been using Adderall for about 2 years now. I am an adult male at the age of 25. I always had an issue focusing in school and I have had a &quot;rocking&quot; issue my entire life. I tend to rock back and forth while reading or sitting about. It was very difficult to complete homework because I would try to figure out the answers to my homework problems but my rocking would take all of my focus and no matter how hard I tried to stop the rocking, I would always end up doing it anyway. As I attended college I was put on academic probation and decided to see a Doctor. Since I have been diagnosed and prescribed Adderall, my life has changed 100% for the better. No more rocking and my focus is incredible!""",1
Buprenorphine,Pain,"""I have been on the Butrans Patch (20) for three weeks.  The results have exceeded my hopes after years of enduring chronic pain related to Fibromyalgia.  The relentless pain in my neck and back while sleeping has been reduced at least 90%.  I am able to make my bed, bathe, cook and do laundry most days.  I am more tired than normal, which is probably attributed to my increase in activity each day.  The negatives so far include moderate agitation and mild itching and irritation at the location site.""",9
Accutane,Acne,"""This stuff is pretty potent, but AMAZING. I love this. I am 22 years old now and have had acne since I was 14. I tried everything out there, from soap, to creams, to every lotion and pill, and NOTHING worked for me. I even tried Proactive for a few months, and saw no results. I have been on ACCUTANE now for almost 3 months, and my acne is gone. And it&#039;s really simple, all you do it take a pill once a day, and the power of Accutane just completely destroys your acne. The only side effect I have noticed is dry lips and skin, but it&#039;s okay as long as I carry chapstick and lotion and I&#039;m alright. But other then that, this is a cure for me and I only have 3 months left.""",4
Focalin,ADHD,"""This was the 6th medication that my 6 yo son tried. Loved Daytrana, but the rashes were terrible and it took forever to kick in. Hated Focalin. He had no better of an appetite on it and most importantly, even though his symptoms were not resolved, he was a zombie on the lowest dosage - hyperfocused, irritable, NO sense of humor (and this is the kid that was always called &quot;a one man show&quot; in school). On to number 7 now....""",1
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Been taking this for 2 months. I&#039;ve tried nearly every other ADHD med. I take IR Methylphenidate 10mgs BID. Although it helps w/ concentration and motivation in my day to day activities, there are downsides.
Pros:
%u2022very cheap
%u2022 makes me feel the best, I genuinely enjoy learning and taking notes in class, among other things
%u2022helps w/ Social Anxiety Disorder, I&#039;m more talkative
CONS:
%u2022Increases impulsivity (e.g. Online shopping, among other things)
%u2022depresses me, makes me more suicidal
%u2022terrible drop off when meds wear off, intense anxiety and depression...

Personally, side effects are too dangerous for me and outweigh the pros. Hope this helps""",1
Doxycycline,Acne,"""It has helped clear up my acne, but it also has given me annoying side effects.  Whenever I take it it always makes my stomach make really loud and embarrassing sounds.  It also gives me indigestion and nausea even if I take it with food.  Yet another side effect is that it makes me dizzy and lightheaded.  I&#039;ve also noticed that my skin is becoming really itchy and even more sensitive than it normally is.  I&#039;ve been on it for less than a week and it&#039;s great that my skin looks kind of decent again, but I don&#039;t think I can put up with the side effects anymore, especially the itching, dizziness, and indigestion.  Looks like I&#039;ll have to find something else to help with my moderate acne.""",4
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Alright guys! If you are thinking about starting the use of Trazodone for your insomnia, Go ahead and take it without a second thought. 
Definitely changed my life a 100 times better. I was having mild insomnia, but it then progressed to severe insomnia and I had to break the loop. Natural supplements don&#039;t do the trick when your body is used to sleeping so less. 
Take Trazodone and slowly wean off when your body starts sleeping better.
And yeah, no side effects (1st week was bad headaches and grogginess but they go away). 
""",0
Contrave,Obesity,"""I am in the middle of week 3.  I have lost 11 pounds and am thrilled.  I had no side effects except a little constipation.  I was feeling great.  Then 2 days ago I noticed my jaw clenching up.  I felt like I was grinding my teeth.  Then the last time I had this happen to me I was on Buproprion.  Same drug in this Contrave.  By the next day I was feeling jittery, clenched jaw and a little spacey.  Not feeling quite right at all.  Kind of nervous and almost feeling like I shouldn&#039;t be driving.  If I was busy I didn&#039;t notice it.  But when I was still it was terrible.  I am so sad, I think I am going to have to quit taking it.  I have had such good results and it was really helping me with my cravings.  I just was not hungry.""",2
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""All of the negative reviews for this device had me so frightened to have the Mirena put in that I almost backed out at the last minute.  I just had it inserted yesterday and haven&#039;t had time to experience many of the side effects that others are talking about, but I can tell you my situation.  I have a great doctor and I just had a baby 8 weeks ago.  I can honestly tell you that there was no pain associated with this procedure at all for me.  The most I felt was a minor cramp (This is not pain ladies!)  When the device settled into the uterus it actually felt more like a baby kicking than anything else.  I will acknowledge that everyone is different and someone else may have a different experience.""",8
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""I started taking lorazapam (Adivan) when I was 16 (I&#039;m 32 now) for panic attacks and anxiety, 2mg twice a day. They did work well but had a short half life. I had 3 grand mal seizures when I was trying to come off of them. I switched to klonopin 6 years ago because a new Dr said that they would keep me on a more even keel because of their longer half life and he was right!!  But even on klonopin, which ARE addictive, I had a grand mal seizure when trying to ween off.  So I just take my klonopin as directed, 1mg 3x a day and I feel normal.  Some people try to say that benzo&#039;s aren&#039;t addictive, but that&#039;s a lie.  So just be careful when u hear others say that they can take their medication only when they &quot;need it&quot;.""",7
Tretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using Tretinoin (0.05 %) for one year now to treat acne on my back, which I had not been able to get rid of with any other topical cream for the past seven years. At first, the Tretinoin cream dried out my skin to the point where it was peeling. I gently exfoliated every morning and used an oil-free moisturizing gel, which helped quite a bit. Then, my acne got worse for a month. However, since I do not feel comfortable using oral medication, I stuck with it and after 6 months my acne was 80% better! There are certain times of the month when some acne does come back, but in general this medication has drastically improved the appearance of my skin. I continue to use it every evening because otherwise the acne seems to return.""",4
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I have suffered from anxiety &amp; depression (with a side of bipolar disorder) since I was a teenager. I&#039;ve tried so many different medications over the years! I now feel like my doctors and I have found the right mix for what my body needs. I suffer from severe degenerative arthritis as well as a few other medical concerns that placed me on Tramadol &amp; Flexeril to try to manage my pain. When I asked for an anxiety medication back (they took me off 7 months ago), she prescribed Buspirone 7.5 BID PRN. It&#039;s only been 3 days, but let me tell you, I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in my thought processes, my nerves, and my sleep. ALL of them have had positive effects. I&#039;ve only experienced drowsiness in the mornings.""",7
Ativan,Anxiety,"""It worked well at first. I was on 1 mg as needed after being diagnosed with M.S. I built a tolerance very quickly even though I was only taking 1 pill 2-3 days a week. Soon I needed 2 at a time, then 3 at a time just to slightly calm my anxiety and panic attack, not fully taking it away (at this time I had been on them approximately a year and a half). Even the first day that I started taking Ativan took 20-30 minutes to feel the effect. Anyone who has severe anxiety or panic attacks knows that is an unbearable amount of time to feel relief. I am now on 1 mg Xanax, which is a God send.""",7
Effexor,Depression,"""Effexor helped me see the reality of my life when I couldn&#039;t. I took Zoloft for a while (up to 150mg) and I felt more numb than &quot;happy&quot;. When I switched to a family doctor from my psychiatrist, they recommended Effexor XR; I&#039;ve been taking 75 mg a day for the past four months and my life has done a complete 180. No depression, very little anxiety, and I finally have CONFIDENCE. I have more friends now than I ever did, a wonderful new relationship that I could never have foreseen myself happening, and I&#039;m performing really well academically. Best decision of my life was taking Effexor- I can immediately see a difference in my thought processes when I forget to take it for two days at a time.""",5
Clonazepam,Insomnia,"""I have taken Klonopin for twenty years.  Sadly, over the years I became resistant to the lower doses.  I am extremely dependent on it and it became &quot;necessary&quot; for the dosage to be steadily increased over the years.  I was all of the way up to 5 mg at night.  This had disastrous side effects...extreme confussion being the most alarming.  It was difficult to start to titrate down slowly.  After many months, I was down to 3 mg. and then down to 2.5 mg.  It was not easy and there were many restless nights filled with anxiety.  Over the last 6 months, I have decreased down to 1.25 mg.  I am struggling but determined to get off within the next year.  Do NOT let this happen to you!""",0
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I am a 32 year old male, 6&#039;2&quot; 318 before I started taking Adipex.  I was a college football player, so I know how to diet and exercise.  However after having a few kids involved in EVERYTHING, a good job, and a wife that is an incredible cook, I packed on the LBS!  Adipex has given me the energy to hit the gym, and stay involved once I get home too, no crash and burn like a lot of those &quot;energy supplements&quot;.  I do get dry mouth everyday. The first week or so I would almost forget to eat.  You have to force yourself to eat, so if your going to do that you might as well eat healthy.  I am working out 4 times a week for an hour at time.  If I had to guess I am down about 20lbs, I go back to the doctor next week for a weigh in and refill.""",3
Solodyn,Acne,"""I recently got horrible cystic acne on my back out of nowhere so I went to a dermatologist and was prescribed Solodyn along with Evoclin Foam cleansing cloths. After about 2 weeks of taking Solodyn I experienced extreme stomach pain and frequent trips to the bathroom. I lost about 8 lbs. After a couple more weeks the stomach pain went away and my back cleared up completely by the end of the pills. However, after stopping it, my face started to break out with little bumps on my forehead and my face was perfect beforehand. I dont know if this is due to stopping Solodyn.""",4
Accutane,Acne,"""I started on Accuntane on 2nd March and I&#039;m now coming up to finishing my treatment with only 3 weeks left. I genuinely can&#039;t express enough how effective Accutane is. My acne was moderate and rather than lesions, etc. I had lots of small spots all over my chin and forehead and beginning to reach out to my cheeks. I went on Duac then oxytetracycline and enthromycin, none of them worked for me! I saw results from Accutane in the first month! My skin did get dry and my lips chapped and flaked badly but if you keep applying E45 and Burts Bees it will keep the flakiness at bay! Honestly I am thankful to Accutane for my new found confidence and I now happily leave the house with no make-up!""",4
Accutane,Acne,"""I&#039;m 13 and in the middle of my 3rd month! My skin is the best its been in 2 years. I have some scars but the Accutane is getting rid of them but I still wear cover up just because I&#039;m so used to it. I started my treatment a day before thanksgiving and I&#039;ll be ending it in April! Although it&#039;s a hassle to get blood drawn and do the pregnancy test it&#039;s worth it! I recommend this for anyone who has annoying acne and has tried everything out there (literally). This is the best medication ever. I love my skin now.""",4
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have been using phentermine since the middle of last year. My starting weight was 235 and I dropped down to 190 at best. My goal weight is 140 (I don&#039;t want to be too thin). I look so much better in my clothes and can actually wear a size 12. I&#039;ve struggled with weight for a very long time and this seems to be the only thing that actually produces results...kudos! P.S.: I do recommend though that you use it then don&#039;t use it for some days that way it can work to it&#039;s full potential and your body won&#039;t get so used to it.""",3
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I feel like I&rsquo;m being a little generous by giving Vyvanse a 3 because it does work to some degree, but I have very unpleasant side effects from it. My doctor finally switched me to generic Adderall IR-thank God-and it&rsquo;s fantastic. I must be abnormal with how I digest Vyvanse or something because I find it far more potent, and not in a good way. It gives me serious dry mouth, diahrrea, anxiety, excessive sweating, and depression. The effect was different almost everyday: some days were okay, a lot were terrible, and a few were good. It muted most of my emotions except a general sense of discomfort. But I could focus when it didn&rsquo;t make me depressed. On the hand, Adderall IR is a cake walk and I feel great in general.""",1
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I was on gabapentin for approx. 4 years and it was great no more tingling down my legs . I took it twice a day and then it stopped working . My doctor told me to take the 300 mg. Pill 3 times a day and I couldn&#039;t tolerate the three pills. I got stomach pains so she took me off and put me on Lyrica and so far one year latter I am fine no more tingling. It is very expensive but the doctor has been giving me samples for the past year. God bless her sole.""",9
Gabapentin,Insomnia,"""For me it had a lot of hallucinogenic properties that lasted for 3 days. The sleep was solid though. It was when you woke up that the hallucinations began. There were closed-eyed and open-eyed hallucinations. In terms of strength, the closed-eyed hallucinations were vivid and clear, like watching TV. The open-eyed ones were very subtle. They decreased rapidly as you got up. The open-eyed hallucinations were still visible well into the third day. If you concentrated you could make them out. I only took the drug twice. 600mg and 300mg. No difference in intensity between the two but at 300mg the residual effects did not last as long.""",0
Tramadol,Pain,"""In all honesty the first time I had tramadol for pain it did nothing for me. It was after my hip surgery. It didnt work for my surgical pain 4 years ago. But the last surgery I had *gallbladder* removal it worked amazingly well.  I&#039;m not sure why it just did. I requested to be put on it bc the hydro codeine stopped working. I didn&#039;t want something stronger I wanted something different. And this last time I fell down my stairs. My hips get stiff sometimes and stop working properly. When this happens I fall down alot. I manged to bruise my lower back to my hip. Doctor gave me tramadol for the acute pain from the bruises on the hip. And it&#039;s been wonderful I can move no pain from stiffness I can move in ways I haven&#039;t been able to in years""",9
Guanfacine,ADHD,"""This drug is terrible.  I am a 13 year old girl and I was put on Guanfacine to treat ADHD (combined).  I started on 1MG and for the first 3 weeks it was great and then all of a sudden, I started to lose energy at 3:00pm.  I would miss out on softball practice because I was so tired.  To fix this, they decided to put me on 2MG.  It worked for a week but then I became really irritable.  Then, I would start getting extremely tired in the afternoon and it was worse than before.  I have schizophrenia as well, so of course I start having hallucinations.""",1
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I really really wanted to LOVE the Mirena. I had inserted on February 14, 2011 (yes Valentine&#039;s day) and finally had it removed today. It definitely made my period&#039;s lighter, but I also had 2 a month, every month at 9 days each. Typically my period is fairly heavy but only 5 days and only once a month. That was complaint #1. I was constantly bloated, and gained 19 lbs despite working out and dieting. My biggest complaint is that I had huge emotional/horomonal issues with this. Everything from random crying, to just being extremely emotional, even depressed at times. I am a fairly happy person normally. I had the Mirena removed and replaced with a Paragard. I really like the aspects of the IUD and not having to worry regularly.""",8
Liraglutide,Weight Loss,"""I started a workout program in February 2016 and was doing well by losing 50 lbs over 8 months.  Like most of us though I wanted more.  I took Saxenda for 6 weeks starting November 1 2016 and lost 14 lbs in the first few weeks.  Appetite was really suppressed and the last 2 weeks I was extremely tired.  I spoke to my Dr about cycling on and off as I noticed the weight loss had stopped once I hit 14 lbs.  I went off Saxenda for 3 weeks and began again at the beginning of January and am down an additional 15 lbs.  I will continue for another week and then cycle off for 3 weeks again and start over.  I find the appetite and energy side effect kicks in around 4 weeks so by cycling on and off I can avoid those effects and maximize the weightloss""",3
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on Prozac for 2 years for post traumatic stress disorder, in May 2012 I had gastric bypass surgery and recently went back to my doctor because I felt like I wasn&#039;t even on my Prozac anymore (I wasn&#039;t absorbing it after surgery) so he doubled the dose. After 3 days I felt way worse! So we dropped the Prozac back down and doubled my Topamax. The combination of Topamax and Prozac made me feel awful! I had uncontrollable crying, bad nausea, and was probably the most depressed I&#039;ve ever been. I was diagnosed with a mild form of Bipolar, so we started on 50 mg of Lamictal for 3 days then we bumped to 100mgs. Its been 5 days, but I can honestly feel a difference! Haven&#039;t cried since, feel better mentally and I&#039;m just happier.""",6
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been on Seroquel for 5 years. I hated it at first because I was only in 7th grade, weighed only 130lbs and was on 900mg. When I first took it I slept for three and a half days. Now it gives me this horrible urge to eat and I can&#039;t stop. A few years back it was lowered to 600mg (still a little to high for my liking) but it has helped with my bipolar and my impulses. It does actually help but avoid being on such a high dose.""",6
Tramadol,Pain,"""I started taking tramadol for chronic shoulder pain after I broke my rotator cup, and found it works about as good as Vicodin. I have since realized it improved my mood much like hydrocodone does, big plus. I just hope I don&#039;t develop a tolerance like on Vicodon. I&#039;ve also realized tramadol decreases my appetite during the day which is another big plus. I highly recommend this medicine for pain if they are reluctant to using narcotic pain relievers.""",9
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I&#039;m now 35 years old and I have been on Oxycontin 80mg 3 per day for about 10 years now, plus breakthrough pain medication.  I found it very helpful until my body gradually developed tolerance to the medicine.  I inquired about going to our local methadone clinic.  I took a chance and tried methadone instead.  Methadone took away all the pain that the oxycodone did but there wasn&#039;t any euphoric feeling. That is what caused problems with my family and the law. Well now I function and I have pain relief, and everyone is happy.  """,9
Contrave,Obesity,"""Lost 9 pds on second week now and I watch everything I eat I read my labels alot more I know its important to watch all that you eat because since I been doing it along with the diet pill I lost 9pds and I&#039;m only on my second week. I don&#039;t know if I want to increase the dose I like the 2 a day. Every time I take a pill I drink 16ounces of water with it then I wait and eat 1 hour later so with good discipline you will be successful I believe""",2
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""First  I want to thank you all for your helpful reviews. It helped me to do my own research so I can suggest my choice of treatment to my psychiatrist, rather than just trusting the one he suggests. After being diagnosed bipolar 2, he suggested another med. I strongly advocated for Lamictal. I tapered up to 200mg, on a conservative schedule. I&#039;ve had good results over the past 9 months. It definitely has lowered the instances of hypomania, or at least deescalated the intensity. It&#039;s done little to address the depression or anxiety, so we&#039;ve agreed to add anti-depressant. Again, he suggested Cymbalta, which I opposed due to the all the information regarding withdrawal syndrome. We agreed on a low dose of Prozac which is going well so far.""",6
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""Went off of Trazadone and Ambien for a new drug by Merck called Belsomra with a 10mg per night starting point. I had the ABSOLUTE worst experience taking this pill and slept maybe 2-3 hours instead of the normal 7-8 on the old combination of meds. Initially I was able to fall asleep for about 1.5 hours but then could not return to sleep consistently after this. I Felt absolutely horrible and for the short sleep I was able to muster I had one of the worst nightmares I could ever remember! I do NOT recommend this medication and instead will return back to the old combination of Ambien and Trazadone which now continues to give me consistent sleep WITHOUT the horrible nightmares. AVOID BELSOMRA at ALL COSTS!""",0
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I was on Cymbalta about a year ago but when I found a job I wasn&#039;t able to make my monthly appointments due to being new and have a probationary period, so I stopped cold turkey and stayed very very dizzy but I was able to beat it and the dizziness went away. After losing my job my depression worsened very bad so I went back to my psychiatrist and got back on them. I got so bad I cried a lot while being alone, suicide thoughts, anger and hatred, lack of confidence. I sat in a recliner for 16 to 18 hours a day, but let me tell you something when I got back on Cymbalta 60mg I have done a complete turnaround. I have lost 40lbs, sex life is great now,  my confidence is through the roof. I smile and laugh instead of crying, no suicidal thoughts.""",5
Contrave,Obesity,"""I&#039;m on my 3rd day with Contrave. I noticed some dizziness, hot flashes (which I didn&#039;t know was a side effect). I can&#039;t really tell if my appetite is suppressed since most of my prior overeating has been stress related. So I&#039;m figuring out the difference between real hunger &amp; stress hunger. I previously took Adipex for 9 months and lost 40lb before it quit working . Then, gained 21lb back when stress levels sky rocketed on my job. They&#039;re still high but I really hope Contrave works. I hoping to lose 30 pounds. Nothing yet but it&#039;s early in the game.""",2
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I got my mirena on February 9th.
I gave it a 9 because I&#039;ve only had it for 2 weeks but I have had little to no issue
Getting it was like a really bad cramp, I did get dizzy. But it went away shortly after.
My doctor said I had to be on my period and I was on day 2 of my cycle and it actually stopped it, only spotted for 2 days afterwards. Hormonal problems tend to ruin in my family as well has severe PMS. This actually helped me. I also have suffered from anxiety and my anxiety decreased significantly, my husband actually noticed this before me. I feel normal for once. Which makes me extremely happy :)""",8
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started this pill on 4/13/15.  At that time I weighed 168, my height is 5&#039;1&quot;.  As of 5/21/15 I have lost 11 pounds.  This pill definitely helps to curb your appetite and give you an energy boost.  I think it&#039;s super important to setup good eating habits and a solid exercise routine while you have the extra energy, especially since this isn&#039;t a pill you&#039;ll be able to take long term.  Use it to your advantage!!  Good luck all, sounds like everyone is doing really well.  Yay us!!!!""",3
Phentermine,Obesity,"""So my Dr just gave me the weight loss pill 37.5 on 11/6/15 cause it&#039;s so hard for me to lose weight I&#039;m 30 years old and 5&#039;6 429lbs yes I know but  Anyways I also have edema so he gave me a water pill Laxis 20mg. Over the weekend I weighed myself when I went to get my blood drawn this morning and the scale said 402.2 I was in total shock but I know that was probably all of the water weight that was on my body but that was still good to me. With the weight loss pill with only being on it for 3 days now I have seen my energy increase rapidly and my appetite has gone down I have to make myself eat which is once a day and I&#039;ll have a snack but I haven&#039;t had a desired to eat any sweets or anything. I go back to the Dr on 11/20 pray for me""",2
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""This is the only anti depressant I&#039;ve ever been on and I&#039;ve been on it for about 4 months now I&#039;ve had about 4 seizures and I twitch as I&#039;m falling asleep and in my sleep I shake uncontrollably, I&#039;ve read a few reviews similar to mine only theirs were worse and have been hospitalized. I am a normal 20 year old healthy female I only suffer from depression and I&#039;m on suboxone I am switching this weekend to Zoloft I put it off for so long because when I don&#039;t have these pills I feel extreme withdrawal and my head feels crazy and brain zaps all weird I can&#039;t handle being off it so I was scared to switch. But to each their own my personal experience with it wasn&#039;t good other than twitching it works.""",5
Onexton,Acne,"""I have been fighting cystic acne for years and finally decided to see a dermatologist who prescribed Onexton. It took about two weeks and my cystic acne has cleared completely. I&#039;m also taking Doryx daily. I had no issues with irritation from using the cream daily. I use coconut oil as a moisturizer which seems to work well. I&#039;ve been using a  mineral SPF since all the other cream sunblocks seem to cause breakouts.""",4
Dapsone,Acne,"""I am 28 and have struggled with acne for 13 years. I had tried everything (benzoyl peroxide products flared my acne). I recently became a dermatology nurse, where I was fortunate enough to sample Aczone. I am so happy I did. My skin feels smoother and I haven&#039;t had any significant pimples since I started using the gel. I only apply it 3- 4 times a week. It even keeps away menstrual breakouts. I love this product!""",4
Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I wouldn&#039;t go as far to say Cymbalta has given me my life back but I will say it improved my quality of life immensely and has kept working.  I have moderate to severe generalized anxiety disorder and I felt like I was living a nightmare - highly uncomfortable and muscle tension so bad I could barely breath at times, constant worry and stress. I have been off and on Lexapro for this very reason because I hated the stigma. Lexapro helped but the sexual side effects were horrible and I felt emotionless.  A Nurse practitioner suggested Cymbalta. I stuck with low dose 30 mg every morning and what a difference. I can breath easier, sex is better (still not back to where it was before antidepressants) but the debilitating anxiety is mostly gone.""",7
Atomoxetine,ADHD,"""45 year old woman, 138lbs 5&#039;7&quot;.
Started at 25mg and titrated slowly. Noticed within a week my stress responses improved. Continued to increase as no change to organisation, memory or attention. Felt ok even at 100mg. Then since I started 120mg, I feel quite unwell. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m unable to sustain this dose as side effects are strong: nausea after 1hr of ingestion, tiredness, feeling as though I&#039;ve had too much strong coffee. The S/E definitely more pronounced if I&#039;m not doing anything so I try and stay active and never take this on an empty stomach! 
I&#039;ll give it 2 more weeks at 120mg (which will be 6 weeks total) then gently titrate down. It gives me palpitations, too, which make me unhappy. 
I get this free on NHS in UK.""",1
Levora,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this pill for about 8 months now. I started when I met the most amazing man in the world. Unfortunately, we&#039;re in a long distance relationship so the small amount of time we get every 2 weeks, he of course wants to have sex. Before I started Levora I would have sex with him 2-4 times a day, it was the most amazing sex of my life! Ever since I started the pill I don&#039;t even want to kiss him. He thinks I&#039;m not attracted to him anymore because I NEVER want to have sex! If he wasn&#039;t so in love and patient with me I know that he would have been gone by now. I absolutely hate how much this has affected my sex drive, it&#039;s caused me to gain 10lbs, and sometimes I get overly emotional/depressed.""",8
Atralin,Acne,"""I experienced a really bad stress breakout on my face, chest and back. I was on an antibiotic for a bit and it did nothing. I finally saw a dermatologist and she prescribed me Atralin. After about two weeks of consistent use, I started seeing results. I now have been using it for about 6 months and am so happy with the results. It cleared up the acne on my back permanently, and I went from having big cysts on my face to now only a few blackheads once in  awhile, and I don&#039;t use it everyday anymore. My chest was the worst, and it cleared up cysts that I had struggled with for MONTHS, and even helped to lighten the red marks they left behind, although they are still somewhat visible. Overall I really liked this product.""",4
Diethylpropion,Obesity,"""I started Tenuate in Mid March and now am down 40  lbs. I use Tenuate along with a low calorie diet and moderate exercise.  I just reached one of my first goals which was to be &lt;200 lbs.  That was a big step for me.  I haven&#039;t been this small since my first pregnancy back in 1995.  I still have a long way to go but I am very happy with the outcome this far.  I usually skip the Tenuate on the weekends because I tend to not eat breakfast on weekends.  If I don&#039;t eat an hour or so after taking the pill in the mornings, I get a little jittery. I would recommend this to anyone looking to lose big numbers. I weigh in with my doctor once a month and she monitors my blood pressure, etc. Couldn&#039;t be happier.""",2
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I suffered depression and anxiety at a very difficult time in my life 5 years ago and have been on efexor 75mg since then... it took the edge off highly stressful situations and helped me to cope in a calm and positive way :)  Life has been good since then, even though family problems have endured (thankfully to a lesser extent)... side effect of nausea was to be expected during first few weeks but after that no problems at all... effexor has been a wonder for me... :):):)""",5
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""For the last 7 years I have had severe anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia. I was given remeron for sleep and klonopin for anxiety. Recently my pdoc and I decided it&#039;s time for me to get off the benzos. She gave me gabapentin and it&#039;s been a life saver. I&#039;m doing well at gradually tapering off klonopin. The only drawback I find is that gabapentin wears off rather fast, and your body builds up a tolerance really fast. Been on it for 3 months now. I started at 100mg 3 times a day. Within a month I was up to 300mg 3xdaily and 600mg at night. Currently I am only taking it PRN at 300mg. As someone who has tried every mood stabilizer and anxiety medication  under the sun. Gabapentin is amazing!""",7
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""This is working great. I read about it in Oprah Winfrey&#039;s O Magizine. Asked my Doctor if it was right for me and he agreed. Losing 5lbs per week (on it for three weeks) I need to get my insurance company to pay and have called them about it asking for it to be considered. Either way I am breaking even as I have no constant hunger pangs. I feel satisfied with small portions, this must be how fit people feel. Good luck with your weight loss journey.  Thanks.""",3
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I have a lot of metal in my spine and this helps a lot without making me drowsy or &quot;stoned&quot;. I can function almost normally on this medication, with the only things holding me back from normal function being the actual metal screws and the associated pains in the torn muscles and sciatic nerve. The pains are still there, but definitely a lot more manageable with the oxycodone. After a brief &quot;breaking in&quot; period my thinking processes returned to normal, with little to no losing track of thoughts or other side effects you might expect with a narcotic like this.""",9
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""When I first started taking this medication, I lost 13lbs in the first month! I was very surprised at the results, as was my doctor, and I had little side effects. I did not do anything other than work at my job place, no extra exercise.  After that month, I stopped the medication. Now I am 25lbs bigger than I was before I lost the 13lbs. I am back to taking it, but am not doing as good as I had before. It may be because, my husband and I miscarried our 1st child in the 7th week of pregnancy.  This may have changed the way my body reacts to things. Although it was a hard time, I didn&#039;t overeat after that. I ate better to get healthier if I become pregnant again, so the gain in weight was not from overeating. I hope to see better results soon.""",3
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I work in a call center and I was made aware of my hyperness and also that I was speaking way too fast to our customers on the phone. In reality I always knew I was a bit loud with my voice and with my actions. I was diagnosed with ADHD and placed on Vyvanse and to my surprise my world changed I am able to focus not just at work but in my life as well. I feel like every thing has been placed in order. Things make sence to me and I love the feeling. I am glad to have this medication in my life, and I don&#039;t see myself as ever going back to living the way I was.""",1
Quetiapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on quetiapine for a few months. It worked wonders and levelled my mood wonderfully and I was thankful to have something work so effectively. However I suffered from two major side effects; tiredness and weight gain. My doctor and I tried to combat the weight gain and tiredness but in the end I had to change to another medication as we couldn&#039;t control it and I was only on 25mg at night. I don&#039;t want to put people off as this drug helped me with my mood disorder and I&#039;m sensitive to some side effects.""",6
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My 11 yo has been on concerta for 2 months. The first few days he did experience some nausea although went away. After the first week I could tell a huge difference in his attitude.. He suddenly had a sense of humor, engaged in conversation without being distracted, and was bringing home/completing homework with no trouble! His grades have immensely improved!! I can tell a difference (not huge) on the weekend days he doesn&#039;t take it. Or if he didnt sleep well the night before and when it begins to wear off in the evening he tends to be a little grouchy. Only other down side I&#039;ve noticed so far is that he has lost approx 4lbs/mo which is concerning if it continues. So far, happy with the results!""",1
Qsymia,Weight Loss,"""After 12 weeks on Qsymia I have lost 20 pounds. Qsymia is NOT a magic diet pill, it will not burn your carbs, or make you change your eating habits, it does ONE thing and one thing only- it will KILL your appetite. My appetite monster on any given day during Qsymia is killed 70-85%. My weight loss has been slow but steady as I realized that my weight loss was 100% dependent on what I SHOVE in my mouth on any given day. I started taking the drug in early February (during flu season) and craved a lot of hot salty soups and comfort foods as I battled several colds and virus&#039;s. My weight loss was very slow during that period. You MUST drop your carbs, and boost your protein intake to loose weight. I drink a big fat protein shake every morning.""",3
Bupropion,Depression,"""I have never felt compelled to share my experiences about medications with others, but recently my mother shows me all of the horrible reviews that antidepressants are being given.  I want others to know that there are in fact real people who benefit from antidepressants.
I have been on Wellbutrin at 300 MG since March 2013, and while I did lose around 15 pounds (I was dieting at the time but the Wellbutrin also could have contributed to it) I have experienced little to no side effects at all, and I have found that I no longer experience crying spells or urges to hurt myself.  The only warning I have is that it really does lower your tolerance to alcohol, so be mindful if you choose to drink.""",5
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started saxenda a littler less than a month ago. I am 5&#039;6 and started out at 201lb. I just got weighted yesterday at doc and am now 194lb. So I lost some weight but not that much. I haven&#039;t changed anything with eating/activity level but notices I eat way less than I did. I am still not at the full dosage I am taking that slow and just started getting welts at the injection site. This is not enough to make me stop. I want to see if this goes away in its own. I will update in another month while trying to eat more health and increasing my activity level.""",2
Accutane,Acne,"""I took Roaccutane 9 years ago at the age of 30. Although I didn&#039;t have cystic acne, I had had persistent facial acne since the age of 12, and nothing helped. Initially the drug helped a lot, with the major side effect being severely chapped lips and dry skin. After several months of treatment my dose was increased. Within days I was depressed and miserable, with crying spells. It took me a while to put 2 and 2 together and consider the medicine as a likely cause. I dropped the dose down again and I quickly improved. However, I feel the damage was done and I gradually became more and more depressed and ultimately was taken of the medicine. For the past 9 years I have suffered depression and anorexia nervosa.""",4
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I was prescribed Gabapentin for horrible, 24/7 MS pain, 300 mg 3x a day at first. It did nothing for the pain, and I spent the entire month I was on it feeling like I was drunk or on a bad 60s type acid trip; I dizzy, staggering, confused, nauseated. My doctor said to give medications a fair chance to work and the side effects should only last a week or so. She increased the dose to 600mg 3x a day when I got no relief from the pain. After a month I couldn&#039;t stand the awful side effects any more and was still in pain so I just quit taking it.""",9
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been on Saxenda since about the middle of May, down 30lbs and I follow a 1800 calorie diet. I have been very lucky as I have not had many side effects. little nausea for a few weeks and when I upped to the 3mg dose I was exhausted for a couple weeks. They have both seem to have subsided now though. This is a great tool to learn how to eat properly and listen to your body. It does curb appetite but some of it will return, but just remember that because you are hungry doesn&#039;t mean you have to eat. As with all weight loss you have to teach yourself proper eating techniques. If you want this drug to work you cant be eating scrap all day and expect results. I definitely recommend this to people who have a hard time saying &quot;no&quot; to food lol""",2
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""My PCP gave me a trial and an RX for Saxenda. I went to fill the script, but, unfortunately, my insurance doesn&#039;t cover it. I can&#039;t pay $800 a month even with the coupon. However, I am using the trial, and absolutely love Saxenda. I have had no side effects, it really helps me with hunger,  helps with cravings , overall, helps me to eat less. I am so sad I cannot continue with this medication for my weight loss, but I definitely recommend this product.""",2
Yasmin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on Yasmin nearly one month and my skin has improved so much! I&#039;m so happy! I feel so much more confident my skin still has a few spots but literally nothing compared to what it was like before! About to go on my Seven day break so hopefully it doesn&#039;t break me out but so far I&#039;m really impressed the only down side is my moods have been all over and I have been up and down it was really bad when I first started on it but it seems to be settling down now! For me it was worth going through that to help my skin because it affected my confidence!""",4
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I lost five pounds in three weeks. I took the pill five days a week and took a break over the weekend. I definitely ate more when I did not take the pill. Overall, I have been eating healthy prior to taking the pill, but this has definitely helped me to avoid rush eating of sweets and other unhealthy things at times when I would be very hungry or stressed. The pill alone is not enough. Exercising on a regular basis makes a big difference. I&#039;m looking to lose five more pounds by the end of this month.""",3
Orlistat,Obesity,"""Worked brilliantly, I cut down my fat intake a week before starting them &amp; continued this whilst on them, I lost 10lb in my first 2 weeks!! Really really pleased with the result &amp; have just ordered my second months supply. You HAVE to reduce you fat intake to stop any unpleasant side effects, I&#039;m now at the point where I don&#039;t want to eat high levels of fat because I don&#039;t want to suffer the consequences!!!
Worked for me!!!""",2
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am a 25 year old female. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder about 5 years ago. I have been taking 150mg of lamotrigine for over 2 years. Thus far I have experienced significant improvements in controlling my bipolar II disorder. I recently paired 100mg of sertraline to improve the lows. Also, I experience rapid cycling. I rated this drug 70% as I feel I still have a long way to go in recovery. But, the drug has definitely allowed me to be a highly functioning individual.""",6
Solodyn,Acne,"""This medicine leaves me feeling undecided and confused. First off, it made me break out bad, and in a type of way I never did before. I had huge cysts all over my back. My Dr said that it &quot;gets everything out of your skin then clears you up.&quot; I did clear up after 4 months on it. It wasn&#039;t until the last month it improved. Problem is that it scarred me everywhere from the cysts. I never broke out on my back like that before, and it actually hurt. I&#039;m hoping the scars become less dark. 

Bottom line: It broke me out bad for 3 months and then cleared up and I&#039;m left with scars. Skin is much clearer but I&#039;m still getting small pimples on shoulders and face.""",4
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I suffered with Obsessive compulsive disorder &amp; generalized anxiety disorder which caused depression and stress. I came on here in June looking for answers, I used to be on Sertraline but they stopped working after I had stopped and went back on them. I thought my life was over. I got put on 20mg Prozac by my Doctor, and it is the best medicine ever, I would highly recommend it, it gave me my life back, I am so happy, no more stresses. Also I have no side effects. Give it about 6 weeks trust me and you will see how this works. Unbelievable. 10/10!""",5
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started saxenda  on September 16 with 226 lbs now I weight 198 lbs I lost 28 lbs in six weeks!!! No side effects i just  feel a bit hungry at times before bed. I did changed  my diet,no wine,sweets or junk food,also I try to avoid carbs, instead I eat lots of fruits, vegetables and protein in small portions. I alternate the medication every other day 1.8 to 2.4 in the morning.
So far Saxenda has been the best I ever tried. October 28 2016""",2
Qsymia,Obesity,"""43 yr female. 5&#039;5&quot; 238 lbs. Taking Qysmia since Dec 23rd.  Started low dose (free ones).  Down 6 lbs. Have been eating nothing but snack foods. Not really hungry, but my mind keep telling me to snack.  Extremely thirsty.  Soda tastes gross.  Which I expected because I used to take Topamax for migraines a few yrs ago. I drink tons of water. Little emotional.  Extreme tiredness midday-early evening then a burst of awakeness toward late night.  Maybe has something to do with when I take the meds. None of the side effects are too concerning to me.  Can&#039;t wait to actually start eating healthier at home so I can do some serious weight loss.  The con to me is the cost.  """,2
Neurontin,Pain,"""Been taking Neurontin for several years now, from 4200mg down to 1200mg a day, after my sciatic nerve got damaged during 1st back surgery. Tried many medicines, no relief, doctor put me on clinical dose of 4200mg a day, many side effects. Down to 3200mg a day, awesome, was able to walk and live(no work). Back got worse, needed 2nd surgery and had to get off some medicines, getting off Neurontin was the WORST WITHDRAWALS. 6 months after doctor&#039;s put me back on Neurontin but only 1800mg. Still on Neurontin today and still working awesome. No side effects, low dose on all medicines keeps side effects down. Just watch the WITHDRAWALS.""",9
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""I started on Wellbutrin XL 150mg after severe depression set in after a traumatic life change.  I could feel a difference within a few days.  After 5 weeks I was still mopey but much better than I was before Wellbutrin.  My doctor increased my dose to 300mg and I felt much better within a week.  I have been on that dose for 4 weeks now and I feel good.  I need to take the advice of exercising while on it to see if it helps increase my happy mood.  Side effects were severe dizziness after standing up but that is now mild.  Night sweats, hot flashes and dry mouth for a few weeks but that went away.  Insomnia increased with dose increase, however, I do not feel overtired from getting less sleep (6 hrs a night).  I would recommend definitely.""",5
Pristiq,Depression,"""I too started Pristiq after 17 years of being on antidepressants. I also have tried everything out there. I did not feel anything at all for the first 2 weeks. However, I started to have these slight body aches - never did I attribute this to the medicine. After another week on this medication, I also could not stay awake for longer than 2 hours at a time. I began having body aches. I could not make it through a day at work, I could barely get out of bed in the morning, and there was no way I could do my household chores. I had many blood tests ran and everything came back normal. I finally realized it may be the Pristiq and after just 3 days of being off of it, I was completely pain free and not tired.""",5
Zoloft,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on the generic sertraline 50mg for about two weeks , and I feel
So much better . I was very depressed , irritable , had insomnia and felt like a total failure at life . I had a little diarrhea at first, but then I also have IBSD so I wasn&#039;t surprised . After a few days that stopped . I feel like my Old self again , like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders . I&#039;m even singing again , I haven&#039;t done that in about a year . I was in denial for a long time , I told myself I could handle the depression -I was wrong . This is the first anti-depressant I&#039;ve been on and I am very pleased with how much it has helped me.""",5
Minocin,Acne,"""I&#039;m 17 years old and have been battling awful cystic acne for about 10 years. As I&#039;ve aged, it&#039;s only worsened, which I&#039;m assuming is due to an influx in hormones. At first, doctors misdiagnosed me as having eczema. When I was finally diagnosed with cystic acne, my doctor prescribed tetracycline. I was on it for about 1 year, at age 14-15, and it helped a little, but not drastic changes. I noticed that it started turning my teeth brown, as if I&#039;d eaten chocolate and didn&#039;t drink anything or brush my teeth afterwards. I was prescribed minocycline (Minocin) instead. It has helped my acne tremendously, but it is still turning my teeth brown, which is not flattering nor attractive, especially for a girl my age with dating and all.""",4
Contrave,Obesity,"""Dry mouth but that just prompted me to drink more water.  Slight headache and insomnia yesterday, but insomnia every day for me and I had my hair up, which could be the cause of the headache.  I won&#039;t blame the meds for any except the dry mouth.   I was fine taking it on an empty stomach. 
This morning when I awoke, I wasn&#039;t crazy thinking about how to battle food cravings all day long.  My willpower was weakening as I get older, or so I thought, but yesterday I was able to work a normal day without thinking about food or the fight with my mind.
With research, I already knew my insurance wouldn&#039;t cover it.  I signed up for the savings card program, $70 out of pocket.""",2
Cymbalta,Depression,"""Cymbalta works very well for me.  I was very reluctant to try it because of the concerns other users have brought up re: side effects and horrors of withdrawal symptoms and talk of &quot;brain zaps.&quot;  I started Cymbalta after trials of Wellbutrin, Lexepro and Celexa within the last two years.  I was desperate to relieve my depression. I began Cymbalta in the spring of 2011.  One side effect I occasionally suffer is stomach upset/burning. Tums relieves the symptoms as well as omeprazole. The other side effect I occasionally suffer from is the flu like symptoms (withdrawal symptoms) if I forget a dose or am late with a dose.  I found the best time to take Cymbalta, for me, is at noon.""",5
Paxil,Depression,"""I was wondering why I had irregular bowel movements for quite some time. I went to Dr. after Dr. explaining my symptoms (constipation, bloating, back pain, dark stool.) Most of them thought I had IBS or an allergy to gluten. I had these symptoms from 2009 till recently. After some thought I decided to switch my medication. My Psychologist wrote me a new prescription and I started to ween of the paxil. 2 weeks into my new medication schedule I started to feel 1000 times better! I go to the bathroom daily now just as a healthy person should. In fact, it seems like my body is trying to make up for lost time. Needless to say, Paxil I feel is the cause of my extreme constipation.""",5
Belsomra,Insomnia,"""I only gave it one star because it was the only choice available. A drug doesn&#039;t put you to sleep keep you up all night. The first night I tried it I couldn&#039;t sleep one minute. I thought it may be just me or something so a few days later I tried it again and the same thing I did not sleep one minute all night and felt like I was in some kind of a boxer. I&#039;ve had some trouble sleeping but always sleep at least four hours a night after taking this medicine I slave zero. This was a shock to me as I thought the medicine was to help me sleep not keep me up all night. Also it makes you feel very weird it&#039;s hard to describe.""",0
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""This was the WORST drug I have been on since I was diagnosed in 1998. I was on the injection for about six months, gained a lot of weight (50 pounds) and had a horrible gallstones flare up in which I was diagnosed with the condition (after fainting in public). I was put back on abilify and prefer the oral pill every day to the injection! One nurse didn&#039;t inject me correctly and I developed sciatica for longer than I was on the medication!!""",6
Lamotrigine,Anxiety,"""I never knew I would ever be able to feel normal again, whatever normal is?  Anyway, I too have struggled with anxiety and depression/PTSD for over 20 yrs.  I began taking Lamotrigine a couple of months ago and literally within a couple of days, I noticed that big ball of anxiousness I used to feel in my chest was gone.. I started with .25 mg and now I&#039;m at 200 mg and am feeling way better.. the downside, if you want to call it that, is that I am starting to have feelings again.  I cry at almost everything but it&#039;s appropriate feelings that I think I was prevented from feeling because of the psyche meds I took for so long that did nothing but ruin my life and give me terrible side effects.  I am grateful to have found this medication.""",7
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""So I&#039;ve tried Phentermine, Belviq, and Topiramate for weight loss. I&#039;m a 5&#039;7 250lb male in my 20s. Out of the 3, Belviq was in the middle. It was good for my mood because I suffer from anxiety. But it only reduced my appetite so much. It kind of helped, but it wasn&#039;t as great as people say. I wouldn&#039;t give it an 8/10 like many on here. I would say anywhere between 5-7/10. It&#039;s also very expensive.""",3
Accutane,Acne,"""I developed acne at about 11 years old.  It wasnt bad, but it got worse.  At about 12-13 years old, it hit hard and got really bad.  I tried everything you could possibly think of.  You say it, I&#039;ve tried it.  But nothing at all worked.  I tried things as little as home remedies to expensive dermatologist cleansers that cost over $100 a bottle.  Still, nothing worked.  For a while I nearly gave up hope, I was so insecure about my skin I wouldn&#039;t even dare to leave the house, let alone my room, without makeup on.  I found makeup was like my security blanket in a way.  I discovered Accutane and let me tell you, it is THE best thing I have ever tried. My acne is gone and 
I&#039;m 15 now. I couldn&#039;t be more happier.  I believe Accutane is a cure.""",4
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I have been taking Ambien for almost 1 yr now and find it to work just well.  I sleep for almost 6 hrs but it takes almost 1- 1.5 hrs to kick in for me. I take it when in bed because once it&#039;s in and the effect takes in I fall right asleep and don&#039;t remember what time I fell asleep, I wake up right when my alarm goes off or if I need to use the restroom.  I don&#039;t wake up groggy and feel pretty great about my day, everyone I believe would like to sleep in more but 4-6hrs is good for me.  I have horrible insomnia which keeps me up all night until about 6-7 am then maybe fall asleep fr being a zombie.  Ambien definitely helps &quot; me&quot;, but yes on a empty stomach is a must it else I can just say I wasted a pill.  Good luck with your experiences.""",0
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I had taken Buspar many years ago until one day I decided I just didn&#039;t need it anymore and stopped taking it, no weaning, no withdrawal. Now I&#039;m back on it again and will stay on it until I feel that way again. It took a couple weeks, and a few days of depression, before it took hold but I have never experienced any side effects. In fact the only thing I feel is that I am thinking positively, rather than looking for a boogey-man in everything. Just a natural feeling of health. Recently the doctor tried something else because of poor sleep and gave me lorazepam, which made my arms and legs feel heavy and I slept for 12 hours, and then diazepam which did nothing much but dampened my feelings and sleep was worse. I&#039;ll stay with Buspar.""",7
Dilaudid,Pain,"""I gave this medication a 5 and here&#039;s why.When I was in the hospital and Dilaudid was put in my Iv, it managed my pain GREAT. It kept me mostly pain free and comfortable enough to be able to sleep at night. Wonderful for my back pain.Now on the other hand,ORAL DILAUDID does not work at all.I thought it was just me after I was Rx&#039;d them for BT pain but my pharmacist agrees. So I give Dilaudid that&#039;s given through an Iv a 10 but the ORAL formulation of this medication I give a 0.Again,this is not just me,my pharmacy told me they&#039;ve gotten many complaints of ORAL Dilaudid not providing relief.""",9
Belviq,Obesity,"""I have been on the medication for a month now and today I go Dr. To see my weight loss.I sometimes forget I have not eaten so I make myself eat and drink plenty of water sometimes I&#039;m eating 1 time per day. Also I noticed because I love fried chicken I would only eat it once a week but I can no longer eat the chicken  - it makes me sick. This pill has helped me in so many ways. I&#039;m thankful to God and the Doctor. I need to loose this weight for health issue and I&#039;m going to be a grandma so I need to be here. I will let you all know how much I lost.""",2
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""Most of my life I&#039;ve been a good sleeper but as I&#039;ve aged not so much anymore. The reasons are mostly related to pain. My rheumatologist prescribed trazodone because I could not tolerate most of the other meds. So I&#039;ve been taking Tylenol PM with good results but with an awful hangover of 5-6 hours the morning after. So far the trazodone has given me the same benefit minus the morning fog. I&#039;ve cut the pill in half and it has given me several nights of painless continued sleep. Awakening rested, painless and ready to start my day. Hopefully this may solve my sleepless problem and some pain too. I don&#039;t like medication but sometimes it really is necessary.""",0
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;m 18 years old, and I was put on exactly 4 weeks ago. I have hormonal acne, and I thought it wasn&#039;t that bad before but I wanted the little bumps off of my face. Now, 4 weeks in, I don&#039;t want to leave the house. I expected the first week to burn and break out and even the second week, but now that I&#039;m on week 4, my skin is red, broken out still, and nothing is going away or healing. Don&#039;t take this. It hasn&#039;t worked for me at all.""",4
Wellbutrin XL,Depression,"""I started taking this medicine for depression and adult ADD like symptoms. I did not notice any side effects at all in the beginning, very easy to start taking.  However, after taking it for about two months, I noticed I was very easily aggravated and overreacted to little things like crazy!  Very emotional, crying, deep emotional pain.  I did not wean off, I just stopped taking it because I didn&#039;t feel like &quot;me&quot;. No adverse reaction in stopping for me although I don&#039;t recommend stopping cold turkey for others.  Only plus was reduced appetite and increased libido!""",5
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I started taking escitalopram at 5mg for two weeks because I was nervous about the side effects, but I didn&#039;t get any. Then I went to 10mg and still no side effects. I have been on 10mg for almost three weeks now and do notice a small difference.  I don&#039;t get as upset about the little things that would bother me and am able to let things go a little easier. I am still hoping that it kicks in a bit more, so we&#039;ll see.""",7
Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am a 17 year old female who was diagnosed with ADD about 9 months ago. I had mainly B and C grades, I was scatter-brained, easily distracted, and extremely messy. Since I started Vyvanse at 30mg, I have bumped up to 40mg and I have no complaints. I have all A and B grades, I can focus on my school work, and get things accomplished in a reasonable amount of time. Only critisicm I have is the fact that is caused me to go from messy to borderline OCD. However, I like cleaning and I see it as a plus side to the medication. As is usual for ADD and ADHD medicines, I experience easy mood swings and sudden out bursts of anger, loss of appetite, and lack of sleep. However, overall I am extremely pleased as a high schooler who was struggling.""",1
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""I have a nine year old son who was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of six. We tried Focalin first and it made him extremely weepy. A month later we tried Vyvanse and had a good experience with it for three years. There was a major rebound effect but we felt lucky to have some relief from symptoms for the hours that we did and dealt with the negatives. We moved from CA to a high altitude state and his meds went haywire. We tried Strattera for two months and he had a stable mood but zero focus. We started Concerta two weeks ago and are extremely happy. We aren&#039;t dealing with an afternoon rebound!!!! He is pleasant. He can focus. We are hopeful that the good will continue. I suggest trying this drug or another one if you aren&#039;t 100% satisfied.""",1
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""Yes, this medicine does work very well for paying attention. It also can be used when you need it and can stop and start use (you can just take it on schooldays even just important school days if you want). It&#039;s good that you don&#039;t have to ruin your weekend with the bad side effects. If you just take one like I have for five years you&#039;ll focus but by noon you&#039;ll be a zombie that hates the sound of people trying to make pointless conversation. """,1
Zolpidem,Insomnia,"""People, be careful with Ambien. I was put on Ambien 10 mg back in late 2014, I recently stopped the medication told turkey. It&#039;s been a week since I quit, I have been having severe withdrawal. Nightmares, night sweats, and frequent urination are the most occurring symptoms I have been dealing with. Doctors seldom tell patients about drug withdrawals, which is why I am suffering from these problems. So, be careful before you take a new prescribed medication.""",0
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been taking 40mg Latuda for about 2 weeks.  No side effects and it does not make me drowsy. I take it with dinner and I&#039;m fine until I go to bed at 9pm.  I fall asleep fine and wake up refreshed. I feel so much better - I have been able to stop taking Depakote and Ambien. Now, I&#039;d like to get off the Lithium. I still have anxiety and irritability but now I can get ahold of myself and see reason and calm down on my own. I would highly recommend. It is expensive though.""",6
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I encountered a bout of hypochondria when Doctors couldn%u2019t diagnose some pain I was having.  Slight worry turned into full-blown panic attacks and daylong anxiety.  With anxiety comes a bunch of physical symptoms and I was certain each one of those symptoms was more proof of me having some sort of undiscovered health condition, feeding into the anxiety.  My physician suggested I try going on Lexapro for 6 months and I was at the end of my rope so I reluctantly agreed.  Side effects were horrible but they went away and within 1 month of my first dose I was completley back to normal.  I&#039;ve now been off it for 6 months and its like my entire episode never happened.  Lexapro saved my life.""",7
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started on this medication back in February of 2017.  I weighed in at 219 +/-.

I had a few side effects [constipation slight] took some over the counter medicine and all is good.  I didn&#039;t see anything at first, it took about 1 1/2 months.  But to date I have lost 31 lbs.  I don&#039;t really notice it looking at myself [I rarely do, as I have been disgusted with my weight issues and how I just really let myself go] but different co-workers noticed that my face was thinner.  Then I noticed that my tops were looking like I was drowning.  All in all, this has been a positive, and I would recommend.  Thank you~""",3
Restoril,Insomnia,"""Due to major anxiety and stress can&#039;t sleep before 6-7:30am was put on anti-anxiety pill and Restoril today.  The anti-anxiety pill kicked in fast and made me kinda drowsy but the Restoril 30mg I just took 45 min ago doesn&#039;t seem to be kicking in.  

Should I take another?  I do drink ale here and there but that should increase my effect not stop it right?  
Maybe I should get used to Vampire hours!! This sucks lol""",0
Saxenda,Obesity,"""I started saxenda on August 17, 2017. My initial weight at the doctor&#039;s office was 229lb. My starting dose was 0.6 mg and now I&#039;m at 1.8 mg. I&#039;ve been on the medication for about 1 1/2 months and lost 16 lbs. I have very little side effects, but I do take my dose at night. I&#039;ve noticed I&#039;m not hungry in the mornings but force myself to eat. However, by the time the afternoon hits I am extremely hungry. I&#039;ve been trying to stick to a 1200 calorie diet, making healthier choices. There are days I get off track. I haven&#039;t exercised much. I&#039;m going to stick with it and see what happens. I know it&#039;s not a miracle cure, but a weight loss tool....I was hoping for a more drastic weight loss.""",2
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ll admit, at first I was extremely skeptical. I had heard about all of the nasty side effects that occur with this medicine. 5 months ago, I had cystic acne SO bad that each side of my face on my cheeks looked like I had a big, inflamed, rash on them. I was embarrassed to leave the house and I had to cake on the makeup, and even then you could tell I had a big problem. Within the first three months or so, I had been on it and while it got better, I was sure it would never get really better because I kept breaking out. Well, I am officially on my 5th and last month and I haven&#039;t had a new pimple in over a week, I am 100% clear. This stuff WORKS. Don&#039;t let people scare you, the side effects are really not that bad. Life changing stuff.""",4
Reclipsen,Birth Control,"""I started taking this pill because I&#039;ve been in a relationship for awhile and wanted to be safe once we decided to start having sex. I&#039;ve now been on it for four months and my experience has been terrible. For the first three months I had severe stomach pain which led to a loss of appetite and a decrease of 15lbs. I mean it&#039;s great that I lost some weight but it wasn&#039;t healthy for my body to go through that. I also continue to experience fatigue. I have little motivation because I am exhausted from the slightest amount of activity. I also feel very sad constantly. I cry almost every day and my mood swings have caused strain on my relationship.""",8
Aczone,Acne,"""I have had severe acne for years. I finally found this topical, and am extremely happy. I have been using it for almost a month. I don&#039;t get any severe drying, but it does keep my skin less oily looking (it&#039;s usually very oily), I don&#039;t have any peeling, redness or sun-sensitivity. I also have a marked reduction in the inflammation of nodules/cysts. It literally shrinks them after application, so I use it before I go out if I have a noticeable red bump or big cyst. I am really pleased, and just hoping it gets better from here. It has also improved the texture and look of my scars, so much so friends and family have commented without me asking! I would definitely recommend this, especially if you have severe acne, adult acne or scarring.""",4

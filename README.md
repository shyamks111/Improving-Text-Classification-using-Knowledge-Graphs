Text Classification Improvement using Knowledge Graphs

This project focusses on improving the performance of BERT using Knowledge Graphs

The main files are 

BERT_NoKGE: This file consists of code to test the baseline model performance for all the datasets considered.
            It also can be used to test the datasets with the String Manipulation Approach
BERT_KGE: This file consists of code to test the BERT model with Knowledge Graph Embeddings(KGE)
          It consists of 3 models which can be used to improve the performance of BERT
          
          
The supporting files are

datasets/ : This folder consists of all the datasets used to test the models created.
kg-embeddings/ : This folder consists of the pickle files used for embeddings
data-prep/ : This folder consists of the files used for data preparation as needed by the main files
